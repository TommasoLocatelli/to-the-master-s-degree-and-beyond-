    "it doesn't matter for the aim of this project to really have a precise split for each work, what really matter is to have the correct assignment between text and year. Especially considering that only secondary works are not already splitted. More than that, it is worth noting that the year of pubblicashion is just a proxy of the period in which a work was written; perhaps earlier works were published later due to pubblicashion issues, but for a such large corpus this should not be a problem. Later on may be interesting to ask to some expertise if some work have a longer period of writting with respect to others and see if it have some impact or can be detected by the analysis."

       " 'text: ': '\\n»*\\nIn the foregoing discussion, particularly in the last\\nchapter, we were repeatedly led to recognize that thought\\nhas its own distinctive objects. At times Lotze gives way to\\nthe tendency to define thought entirely in terms of modes\\nand forms of activity which are exercised by it upon a strictly\\nforeign material. But two motives continually push him in\\nthe other direction. (1) Thought has a distinctive work to\\ndo, one which involves a qualitative transformation of (at\\nleast) the relationships of the presented matter; as fast as it\\naccomplishes this work, the subject-matter becomes \\nsomehow thought\\'s subject-matter. As we have just seen, the data\\nare progressively organized to meet thought\\'s ideal of a \\ncomplete whole, with its members interconnected according to\\na determining principle. Such progressive organization\\nthrows backward doubt upon the assumption of the original\\ntotal irrelevancy of the data and thought-forms to each other.\\n(2) A like motive operates from the side of the subject-\\nmatter. As merely foreign and external, it is too \\nheterogeneous to lend itself to thought\\'s exercise and influence. The\\nidea, as we saw in the first chapter, is the convenient \\nmedium through which Lotze passes from the purely \\nheterogeneous psychical impression or event, which is totally irrelevant\\nto thought\\'s purpose and working, over to a state of affairs\\nwhich can reward thought. Idea as meaning forms the bridge\\nover from the brute factuality of the psychical impression to\\nthe coherent value of thought\\'s own content.\\nWe have, in this chapter, to consider the question of the\\nidea or content of thought from two points of view: first, the\\npossibility of such a content—its consistency with Lotze\\'s\\n  \\n                            \\nfundamental premises; secondly, its objective character—its\\nvalidity and test.\\nI. The question of the possibility of a specific content\\nof thought is the question of the nature of the idea as \\nmeaning. Meaning is the characteristic object of thought. We have\\nthus far left unquestioned Lotze\\'s continual assumption of\\nmeaning as a sort of thought-unit; the building-stone of\\nthought\\'s construction. In his treatment of meaning, Lotze\\'s\\ncontradictions regarding the antecedents, data, and content\\nof thought reach their full conclusion. He expressly makes\\nmeaning to be the product of thought\\'s activity and also\\nthe unreflective material out of which thought\\'s operations\\ngrow.\\nThis contradiction has been worked out in accurate and\\ncomplete detail by Professor Jones. Philosophy of Lotze, Ch. 3, \"Thought and the Preliminary Proc-ess\\nProcess of Experience.\"\\n»1 He summarizes it as\\nfollows (pp. 98-99): \"No other way was left to him [Lotze]\\nexcept this of first attributing all to sense and afterwards\\nattributing all to thought, and, finally of attributing it to\\nthought only because it was already in its material. This\\nsee-saw is essential to his theory; the elements of knowledge\\nas he describes them can subsist only by the alternate \\nrobbery of each other.\" We have already seen how strenuously\\nLotze insists upon the fact that the given subject-matter of\\nthought is to be regarded wholly as the work of a physical\\nmechanism, \"without any action of thought.\" Logic, I, 38.\\n»2 But Lotze also\\nstates that if the products of the psychical mechanism \"are\\nto admit of combination in the definite form of a thought,\\nthey each require some previous shaping to make them into\\nlogical building-stones and to convert them from impressions\\ninto ideas. Nothing is really more familiar to us than this\\nfirst operation of thought; the only reason why we usually\\noverlook it is that in the language which we inherit, it is\\nalready carried out, and it seems, therefore, to belong to the\\nself-evident presuppositions of thought, not to its own specific\\nwork.\" Logic, I, 13; last italics mine.\\n»3 And again (Logic, I, 23), judgments \"can consist of\\nnothing but combinations of ideas which are no longer mere\\n  \\n                            \\nimpressions: every such idea must have undergone at least\\nthe simple formation mentioned above.\" Such ideas are,\\nLotze goes on to urge, already rudimentary concepts—that\\nis to say, logical determinations.\\nThe obviousness of the logical contradiction of \\nattributing to a preliminary specific work of thought exactly the\\ncondition of affairs which is elsewhere explicitly attributed\\nto a psychical mechanism prior to any thought-activity,\\nshould not blind us to its import and relative necessity. The\\nimpression, it will be recalled, is a mere state of our own\\nconsciousness—a mood of ourselves. As such it has simply\\nde facto relations as an event to other similar events. But\\nreflective thought is concerned with the relationship of a\\ncontent or matter to other contents. Hence the impression\\nmust have a matter before it can come at all within the\\nsphere of thought\\'s exercise. How shall it secure this? Why,\\nby a preliminary activity of thought which objectifies the \\nimpression. Blue as a mere sensuous irritation or feeling is\\ngiven a quality, the meaning \"blue\"—blueness; the sense-\\nimpression is objectified; it is presented \"no longer as a\\ncondition which we undergo, but as a something which has\\nits being and its meaning in itself, and which continues to\\nbe what it is, and to mean what it means whether we are\\nconscious of it or not. It is easy to see here the necessary\\nbeginning of that activity which we above appropriated to\\nthought as such: it has not yet got so far as converting \\ncoexistence into coherence. It has first to perform the previous\\ntask of investing each single impression with an independent\\nvalidity, without which the later opposition of their real\\ncoherence to mere coexistence could not be made in any\\nintelligible sense.\" Logic, I, 14; italics mine.\\n»4\\nThis objectification, which converts a sensitive state\\ninto a sensible matter to which the sensitive state is referred,\\nalso gives this matter \"position,\" a certain typical character.\\nIt is not objectified in a merely general way, but is given a\\nspecific sort of objectivity. Of these sorts of objectivity there\\nare three mentioned: that of a substantive content; that of\\nan attached dependent content; that of an active relationship\\n  \\n                            \\nconnecting the various contents with each other. In short,\\nwe have the types of meaning embodied in language in the\\nform of nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It is through this \\npreliminary formative activity of thought that reflective or \\nlogical thought has presented to it a world of meanings ranged\\nin an order of relative independence and dependence, and\\narranged as elements in a complex of meanings whose\\nvarious constituent parts mutually influence one another\\'s\\nmeanings. See Logic, I, 16-20. On p. 22 this work is declared to be not only\\nthe first, but the most indispensable of all thought\\'s operations.\\n»5\\nAs usual, Lotze mediates the contradiction between\\nmaterial constituted by thought and the same material just\\npresented to thought, by a further position so disparate to\\neach that, taken in connection with each by turns, it seems\\nto bridge the gulf. After describing the prior constitutive\\nwork of thought as above, he goes on to discuss a second\\nphase of thought which is intermediary between this and the\\nthird phase, viz., reflective thought proper. This second \\nactivity is that of arranging experienced quales in series and\\ngroups, thus ascribing a sort of universal or common \\nsomewhat to various instances (as already described; see pp.\\n342-43). On one hand, it is clearly stated that this second\\nphase of thought\\'s activity is in reality the same as the first\\nphase: since all objectification involves positing, since \\npositing involves distinction of one matter from others, and since\\nthis involves placing it in a series or group in which each is\\nmeasurably marked off, as to the degree and nature of its\\ndiversity, from every other. We are told that we are only\\nconsidering \"a really inseparable operation\" of thought from\\ntwo different sides: first, as to the effect which objectifying\\nthought has upon the matter as set over against the feeling\\nsubject; secondly, the effect which this objectification has\\nupon the matter in relation to other matters. Logic, I, 26.\\n»6 Afterward,\\nhowever, these two operations are declared to be radically\\ndifferent in type and nature. The first is determinant and\\nformative; it gives ideas \"the shape without which the logical\\nspirit could not accept them.\" In a way it dictates \"its own\\nlaws to its object-matter.\" Logic, I, 35.\\n»7 The second activity of thought is\\n  \\n                            \\nrather passive and receptive. It simply recognizes what is\\nalready there. \"Thought can make no difference where it\\nfinds none already in the matter of impressions.\" Logic, I, 36; see the strong statements already quoted, pp. 321-22.\\nWhat if this canon were applied in the first act of thought re-ferred\\nreferred to above: the original objectification which transforms the\\nmere state into an abiding quality or meaning? Suppose, that is,\\nit were said that the first objectifying act cannot make a sub-stantial\\nsubstantial (or attached) quale out of a mere state of feeling; it\\nmust find the distinction it makes there already! It is clear we\\nshould at once get a regressus ad infinitum. We here find Lotze\\nface-to-face with this fundamental dilemma: thought either ar-bitrarily\\narbitrarily forces in its own distinctions, or else just repeats what\\nis already there—is either falsifying or futile. This same con-tradiction\\ncontradiction, so far as it affects the impression, has already been\\ndiscussed. See p. 323.\\n»8 \"The first\\nuniversal, as we saw, can only be experienced in immediate\\nsensation. It is no product of thought, but something that\\nthought finds already in existence.\" Logic, I, 31.\\n»9\\nThe obviousness of this further contradiction is \\nparalleled only by its inevitableness. Thought is in the air, is\\narbitrary and wild in dealing with meanings, unless it gets\\nits start and cue from actual experience. Hence the necessity\\nof insisting upon thought\\'s activity as just recognizing the\\ncontents already given. But, on the other hand, prior to the\\nwork of thought there is to Lotze no content or meaning. It\\nrequires a work of thought to detach anything from the flux\\nof sense-irritations and invest it with a meaning of its own.\\nThis dilemma is inevitable to any writer who declines to\\nconsider as correlative the nature of thought-activity and\\nthought-content from the standpoint of their generating\\nconditions in the movement of experience. Viewed from such\\na standpoint the principle of solution is clear enough. As we\\nhave already seen (pp. 327-28), the internal dissension of an\\nexperience leads to detaching certain factors previously \\nintegrated in the concrete experience as aspects of its own\\nqualitative coloring, and to relegating them, for the time\\nbeing (pending integration into further immediate qualities\\nof a reconstituted experience), into a world of bare \\nmeanings, a sphere qualified as ideal throughout. These meanings\\nthen become the tools of thought in interpreting the data,\\njust as the sense-qualities which define the presented \\nsituation are the immediate matter for thought. The two as\\n  \\n                            \\nmutually referred are content. That is, the datum and the\\nmeaning as reciprocally qualified by each other constitute the\\nobjective of thought.\\nTo reach this unification is thought\\'s objective or goal.\\nEvery successive cross-section of reflective inquiry presents\\nwhat may be taken for granted as the outcome of previous\\nthinking, and as the determinant of further reflective \\nprocedure. Taken as defining the point reached in the \\nthoughtfunction and serving as constituent unit in further thought,\\nit is content or logical object. Lotze\\'s instinct is sure in\\nidentifying and setting over against each other the material\\ngiven to thought and the content which is thought\\'s own\\n\"building-stone.\" His contradictions arise simply from the\\nfact that his absolute, non-historic method does not permit\\nhim to interpret this joint identity and distinction in a \\nworking, and hence relative, sense.\\nII. The question of how the existence of meanings, or\\nthought-contents, is to be understood merges imperceptibly\\ninto the question of the real objectivity or validity of such\\ncontents. The difficulty for Lotze is the now familiar one: So\\nfar as his logic compels him to insist that these meanings are\\nthe possession and product of thought (since thought is an\\nindependent activity), the ideas are merely ideas; there is no\\ntest of objectivity beyond the thoroughly unsatisfactory and\\nformal one of their own mutual consistency. In reaction from\\nthis Lotze is thrown back upon the idea of these contents as\\nthe original matter given in the impressions themselves. Here\\nthere seems to be an objective or external test by which the\\nreality of thought\\'s operations may be tried; a given idea is\\nverified or found false according to its measure of \\ncorrespondence with the matter of experience as such. But now\\nwe are no better off. The original independence and \\nheterogeneity of impressions and of thought is so great that there\\nis no way to compare the results of the latter with the\\nformer. We cannot compare or contrast distinctions of\\nworth with bare differences of factual existence (Logic, I,\\n2). The standard or test of objectivity is so thoroughly \\nexternal that by original definition it is wholly outside the realm\\nof thought. How can thought compare meanings with\\nexistences?\\n  \\n                            \\nOr again, the given material of experience apart from\\nthought is precisely the relatively chaotic and unorganized; it\\neven reduces itself to a mere sequence of psychical events.\\nWhat sense is there in directing us to compare the highest\\nresults of scientific inquiry with the bare sequence of our\\nown states of feeling; or even with the original data whose\\nfragmentary and uncertain character was the exact motive\\nfor entering upon scientific inquiry? How can the former\\nin any sense give a check or test of the value of the latter?\\nThis is professedly to test the validity of a system of \\nmeanings by comparison with that whose defects call forth the\\nconstruction of the system of meanings.\\nOur subsequent inquiry simply consists in tracing some\\nof the phases of the characteristic seesaw from one to the\\nother of the two horns of the now familiar dilemma: either\\nthought is separate from the matter of experience, and then\\nits validity is wholly its own private business; or else the\\nobjective results of thought are already in the antecedent\\nmaterial, and then thought is either unnecessary, or else has\\nno way of checking its own performances.\\n1. Lotze assumes, as we have seen, a certain \\nindependent validity in each meaning or qualified content, taken\\nin and of itself. \"Blue\" has a certain meaning, in and of\\nitself; it is an object for consciousness as such, not merely\\nits state or mood. After the original sense-irritation through\\nwhich it was mediated has entirely disappeared it persists\\nas a valid meaning. Moreover, it is an object or content of\\nthought for others as well. Thus it has a double mark of\\nvalidity: in the comparison of one part of my own \\nexperience with another, and in the comparison of my experience\\nas a whole with that of others. Here we have a sort of\\nvalidity which does not raise at all the question of \\nmetaphysical reality (Logic, I, 14, 15). Lotze thus seems to have\\nescaped from the necessity of employing as check or test for\\nthe validity of ideas any reference to a real outside the\\nsphere of thought itself. Such terms as \"conjunction,\"\\n\"franchise,\" \"constitution,\" \"algebraic zero,\" etc., claim to\\npossess objective validity. Yet none of these professes to\\nrefer to a reality beyond thought. Generalizing this point of\\nview, validity or objectivity of meaning means simply that\\n  \\n                            \\nwhich is \"identical for all consciousness\" (Logic, I, 3); \"it\\nis quite indifferent whether certain parts of the world of\\nthought indicate something which has ^besides an \\nindependent reality outside of thinking minds, or whether all\\nthat it contains exists only in the thoughts of those who\\nthink it, but with equal validity for them all\" (Logic, I, 16).\\nSo far it seems clear sailing. Difficulties, however, show\\nthemselves, the moment we inquire what is meant by a self-\\nidentical content for all thought. Is this to be taken in a\\nstatic or in a dynamic way? That is to say: Does it express\\nthe fact that a given content or meaning is de facto \\npresented to the consciousness of all alike? Does this coequal\\npresence guarantee an objectivity? Or does validity attach\\nto a given meaning or content in the sense that it directs and\\ncontrols the further exercise of thinking, and thus the \\nformation of further new objects of knowledge?\\nThe former interpretation is alone consistent with\\nLotze\\'s notion that the independent idea as such is invested\\nwith a certain validity or objectivity. It alone is consistent\\nwith his assertion that concepts precede judgments. It alone,\\nthat is to say, is consistent with the notion that reflective\\nthinking has a sphere of ideas or meanings supplied to it\\nat the outset. But it is impossible to entertain this belief.\\nThe stimulus which, according to Lotze, goads thought on\\nfrom ideas or concepts to judgments and inferences, is in\\ntruth simply the lack of validity, of objectivity in its original\\nindependent meanings or contents. A meaning as \\nindependent is precisely that which is not invested with validity,\\nbut which is a mere idea, a \"notion,\" a fancy, at best a \\nsurmise which may turn out to be valid (and of course this\\nindicates possible reference); a standpoint to have its value\\ndetermined by its further active use. \"Blue\" as a mere \\ndetached floating meaning, an idea at large, would not gain\\nin validity simply by being entertained continuously in a\\ngiven consciousness, or by being made at one and the same\\ntime the persistent object of attentive regard by all human\\nconsciousnesses. If this were all that were required, the\\nchimera, the centaur, or any other subjective construction,\\ncould easily gain validity. \"Christian Science\" has made just\\nthis notion the basis of its philosophy.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe simple fact is that in such illustrations as \"blue,\"\\n\"franchise,\" \"conjunction,\" Lotze instinctively takes cases\\nwhich are not mere independent and detached meanings,\\nbut which involve reference to a region of experience, to a\\nregion of mutually determining social activities. The \\nconception that reference to a social activity does not involve\\nthe same sort of reference of a meaning beyond itself that is\\nfound in physical matters, and hence may be taken quite\\ninnocent and free of the problem of reference to existence\\nbeyond meaning, is one of the strangest that has ever found\\nlodgment in human thinking. Either both physical and social\\nreference or neither, is logical; if neither, then it is because\\nthe meaning functions, as it originates, in a specific situation\\nwhich carries with it its own tests (see pp. 311-12). Lotze\\'s\\nconception is made possible only by unconsciously \\nsubstituting the idea of an object as a content of thought for a large\\nnumber of persons (or a de facto somewhat for every \\nconsciousness), for the genuine definition of object as a \\ndeterminant in a scheme of activity. The former is consistent\\nwith Lotze\\'s conception of thought, but wholly indeterminate\\nas to validity or intent. The latter is the test used \\nexperimentally in all concrete thinking, but involves a radical\\ntransformation of all Lotze\\'s assumptions. A given idea of the\\nconjunction of the franchise, or of blue, is valid, not \\nbecause everybody happens to entertain it, but because it \\nexpresses the factor of control or direction in a given movement\\nof experience. The test of validity of idea As we have already seen, the concept, the meaning as such, is\\nalways a factor or status in a reflective situation; it is always a\\npredicate of judgment, in use in interpreting and developing the\\nlogical subject, or datum of perception.\\n»10 is its functional or\\ninstrumental use in effecting the transition from a relatively\\nconflicting experience to a relatively integrated one. If Lotze\\'s\\nview were correct, \"blue\" valid once would be valid always—\\neven when red or green were actually called for to fulfill\\nspecific conditions. This is to say validity really refers to\\nrightfulness or adequacy of performance in an asserting of\\nconnection—not to a meaning as contemplated in \\ndetachment.\\nIf we refer again to the fact that the genuine antecedent\\n  \\n                            \\nof thought is a situation which is disorganized in its \\nstructural elements, we can easily understand how certain \\ncontents may be detached and held apart as meanings or \\nreferences, actual or possible. We can understand how such\\ndetached contents may be of use in effecting a review of the\\nentire experience, and as affording standpoints and methods\\nof a reconstruction which will maintain the integrity of\\nbehavior. We can understand how validity of meaning is\\nmeasured by reference to something which is not mere \\nmeaning; by reference to something which lies beyond it as such—\\nviz., the reconstitution of an experience into which it enters\\nas method of control. That paradox of ordinary experience\\nand of scientific inquiry by which objectivity is given alike\\nto matter of perception and to conceived relations—to facts\\nand to laws—affords no peculiar difficulty because the test\\nof objectivity is everywhere the same: anything is objective\\nin so far as, through the medium of conflict, it controls the\\nmovement of experience in its reconstructive transition.\\nThere is not first an object, whether of sense-perception or\\nof conception, which afterward somehow exercises this \\ncontrolling influence; but the objective is any existence \\nexercising the function of control. It may only control the act of\\ninquiry; it may only set on foot doubt, but this is direction\\nof subsequent experience, and, in so far, is a token of \\nobjectivity. It has to be reckoned with.\\nSo much for the thought-content or meaning as having\\na validity of its own. It does not have it as isolated or given\\nor static; it has it in its dynamic reference, its use in \\ndetermining further movement of experience. In other words, the\\n\"meaning,\" having been selected and made up with reference\\nto performing a certain office in the evolution of a unified\\nexperience, can be tested in no other way than by discovering\\nwhether it does what it was intended to do and what it \\npurports to do. Royce, in his World and Individual, I, Chs. 6 and 7, has criti-cized\\ncriticized the conception of meaning as valid, but in a way which\\nimplies that there is a difference between validity and reality, in\\nthe sense that the meaning or content of the valid idea becomes\\nreal only when it is experienced in direct feeling. The foregoing\\nimplies, of course, a difference between validity and reality, but\\nfinds the test of validity in exercise of the function of direction\\nor control to which the idea makes pretension or claim. The\\n\\nsame point of view would profoundly modify Royce\\'s interpreta-tion\\ninterpretation of what he terms \"inner\" and \"outer\" meaning. See Moore,\\nUniversity of Chicago Decennial Publications, III, on \"Existence,\\nMeaning, and Reality.\"\\n»11\\n  \\n                            \\n2. Lotze has to wrestle with this question of validity in\\na further respect: What constitutes the objectivity of \\nthinking as a total attitude, activity, or function? According to his\\nown statement, the meanings or valid ideas are after all only\\nbuilding-stones for logical thought. Validity is thus not a\\nproperty of them in their independent existences, but of\\ntheir mutual reference to each other. Thinking is the process\\nof instituting these mutual references; of building up the\\nvarious scattered and independent building-stones into\\nthe coherent system of thought. What is the validity of the\\nvarious forms of thinking which find expression in the\\nvarious types of judgment and in the various forms of\\ninference? Categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive judgment;\\ninference by induction, by analogy, by mathematical \\nequation; classification, theory of explanation—all these are \\nprocesses of reflection by which connection in an organized whole\\nis given to the fragmentary meanings with which thought\\nsets out. What shall we say of the validity of such processes?\\nOn one point Lotze is quite clear. These various logical\\nacts do not really enter into the constitution of the valid\\nworld. The logical forms as such are maintained only in the\\nprocess of thinking. The world of valid truth does not \\nundergo a series of contortions and evolutions, paralleling in\\nany way the successive steps and missteps, the succession\\nof tentative trials, withdrawals, and retracings, which mark\\nthe course of our own thinking. Logic, II, 257, 265, and in general Bk. III, Ch. 4. It is significant\\nthat thought itself, appearing as an act of thinking over against\\nits own content, is here treated as psychical rather than as logi-cal\\nlogical. Consequently, as we see in the text, it gives him one more\\ndifficulty to wrestle with: how a process which is ex officio\\npurely psychical and subjective can yet yield results which are\\nvalid, in a logical, to say nothing of an ontological, sense.\\n»12\\nLotze is explicit upon the point that only the thought-\\ncontent in which the process of thinking issues has objective\\nvalidity; the act of thinking is \"purely and simply an inner\\nmovement of our own minds, made necessary to us by \\nreason of the constitution of our nature and of our place in the\\nworld\" (Logic, II, 279).\\n  \\n                            \\nHere the problem of validity presents itself as the \\nproblem of the relation of the act of thinking to its own product.\\nIn his solution Lotze uses two metaphors: one derived from\\nbuilding operations, the other from traveling. The \\nconstruction of a building requires of necessity certain tools and\\nextraneous constructions, stagings, scaffoldings, etc., which\\nare necessary to effect the final construction, but which do\\nnot enter into the building as such. The activity has an \\ninstrumental, though not a constitutive, value as regards its\\nproduct. Similarly, in order to get a view from the top of a\\nmountain—this view being the objective—the traveler has to\\ngo through preliminary movements along devious courses.\\nThese again are antecedent prerequisites, but do not \\nconstitute a portion of the attained view.\\nThe problem of thought as activity, as distinct from\\nthought as content, opens up altogether too large a question\\nto receive complete consideration at this point. Fortunately,\\nhowever, the previous discussion enables us to narrow the\\npoint which is in issue just here. The question is whether\\nthe activity of thought is to be regarded as an independent\\nfunction supervening entirely from without upon \\nantecedents, and directed from without upon data, or whether it\\nmarks the phase of the transformation which the course of\\nexperience (whether practical, or artistic, or socially \\naffectional or whatever) undergoes for the sake of its deliberate\\ncontrol. If it be the latter, a thoroughly intelligent sense can\\nbe given to the proposition that the activity of thinking is\\ninstrumental, and that its worth is found, not in its own\\nsuccessive states as such, but in the result in which it comes\\nto conclusion. But the conception of thinking as an \\nindependent activity somehow occurring after an independent \\nantecedent, playing upon an independent subject-matter, and finally\\neffecting an independent result, presents us with just one\\nmiracle the more.\\nI do not question the strictly instrumental character of\\nthinking. The problem lies not here, but in the interpretation\\nof the nature of the instrument. The difficulty with Lotze\\'s\\nposition is that it forces us into the assumption of a means\\nand an end which are simply and only external to each\\nother, and yet necessarily dependent upon each other—a\\nposition which, whenever found, is thoroughly \\n  \\n                            \\nself-contradictory. Lotze vibrates between the notion of thought as a\\ntool in the external sense, a mere scaffolding to a finished\\nbuilding in which it has no part nor lot, and the notion of\\nthought as an immanent tool, as a scaffolding which is an\\nintegral part of the very operation of building, and which is\\nset up for the sake of the building-activity which is carried\\non effectively only with and through a scaffolding. Only in\\nthe former case can the scaffolding be considered as a mere\\ntool. In the latter case the external scaffolding is not the \\ninstrumentality; the actual tool is the action of erecting the\\nbuilding, and this action involves the scaffolding as a \\nconstituent part of itself. The work of building is not set over\\nagainst the completed building as mere means to an end; it\\nis the end taken in process or historically, longitudinally,\\ntemporally viewed. The scaffolding, moreover, is not an \\nexternal means to the process of erecting, but an organic \\nmember of it. It is no mere accident of language that \"building\"\\nhas a double sense—meaning at once the process and the\\nfinished product. The outcome of thought is the thinking\\nactivity carried on to its own completion; the activity, on the\\nother hand, is the outcome taken anywhere short of its own\\nrealization, and thereby still going on.\\nThe only consideration which prevents easy and \\nimmediate acceptance of this view is the notion of thinking as\\nsomething purely formal. It is strange that the empiricist\\ndoes not see that his insistence upon a matter accidentally\\ngiven to thought only strengthens the hands of the rationalist\\nwith his claim of thinking as an independent activity, \\nseparate from the actual make-up of the affairs of experience.\\nThinking as a merely formal activity exercised upon certain\\nsensations or images or objects sets forth an absolutely \\nmeaningless proposition. The psychological identification of \\nthinking with the process of association is much nearer the truth.\\nIt is, indeed, on the way to the truth. We need only to\\nrecognize that association is of matters or meanings, not of\\nideas as existences or events; and that the type of association\\nwe call thinking differs from casual fancy and revery by\\ncontrol in reference to an end, to apprehend how completely\\nthinking is a reconstructive movement of actual contents of\\nexperience in relation to each other.\\nThere is no miracle in the fact that tool and material\\n  \\n                            \\nare adapted to each other in the process of reaching a valid\\nconclusion. Were they external in origin to each other and\\nto the result, the whole affair would, indeed, present an \\ninsoluble problem—so insoluble that, if this were the true\\ncondition of affairs, we never should even know that there\\nwas a problem. But, in truth, both material and tool have\\nbeen secured and determined with reference to economy and\\nefficiency in effecting the end desired—the maintenance of\\na harmonious experience. The builder has discovered that\\nhis building means building tools, and also building material.\\nEach has been slowly evolved with reference to its fit employ\\nin the entire function; and this evolution has been checked\\nat every point by reference to its own correspondent. The\\ncarpenter has not thought at large on his building and then\\nconstructed tools at large, but has thought of his building in\\nterms of the material which enters into it, and through that\\nmedium has come to the consideration of the tools which are\\n^helpful.\\nThis is not a formal question, but one of the place and\\nrelations of the matters actually entering into experience.\\nAnd they in turn determine the taking up of just those\\nmental attitudes, and the employing of just those intellectual\\noperations which most effectively handle and organize the\\nmaterial. Thinking is adaptation to an end through the \\nadjustment of particular objective contents.\\nThe thinker, like the carpenter, is at once stimulated\\nand checked in every stage of his procedure by the particular\\nsituation which confronts him. A person is at the stage of\\nwanting a new house: well then, his materials are available\\nresources, the price of labor, the cost of building, the state\\nand needs of his family, profession, etc.; his tools are paper\\nand pencil and compass, or possibly the bank as a credit \\ninstrumentality, etc. Again, the work is beginning. The \\nfoundations are laid. This in turn determines its own specific\\nmaterials and tools. Again, the building is almost ready for\\noccupancy. The concrete process is that of taking away the\\nscaffolding, clearing up the grounds, furnishing and \\ndecorating rooms, etc. This specific operation again determines its\\nown fit or relevant materials and tools. It defines the time\\nand mode and manner of beginning and ceasing to use them.\\n  \\n                            \\nLogical theory will get along as well as does the practice of\\nknowing when it sticks close by and observes the directions\\nand checks inherent in each successive phase of the \\nevolution of the cycle of experience. The problem in general of\\nvalidity of the thinking process as distinct from the validity\\nof this or that process arises only when thinking is isolated\\nfrom its historic position and its material context (see ante,\\np. 311).\\n3. But Lotze is not yet done with the problem of \\nvalidity, even from his own standpoint. The ground shifts again\\nunder his feet. It is no longer a question of the validity of\\nthe idea or meaning with which thought is supposed to set\\nout; it is no longer a question of the validity of the process of\\nthinking in reference to its own product; it is the question of\\nthe validity of the product. Supposing, after all, that the\\nfinal meaning, or logical idea, is thoroughly coherent and\\norganized; supposing it is an object for all consciousness\\nas such. Once more arises the question: What is the validity\\nof even the most coherent and complete idea?—a question\\nwhich arises and will not down. We may reconstruct the\\nnotion of the chimera until it ceases to be an independent\\nidea and becomes a part of the system of Greek mythology.\\nHas it gained in validity in ceasing to be an independent\\nmyth, in becoming an element in systematized myth? Myth\\nit was and myth it remains. Mythology does not get validity\\nby growing bigger. How do we know the same is not the case\\nwith the ideas which are the product of our most deliberate\\nand extended scientific inquiry? The reference again to the\\ncontent as the self-identical object of all consciousness\\nproves nothing; the subject-matter of a hallucination does\\nnot gain validity in proportion to its social contagiousness.\\nAccording to Lotze, the final product is, after all, still\\nthought. Now, Lotze is committed once for all to the notion\\nthat thought, in any form, is directed by and at an outside\\nreality. The ghost haunts him to the last. How, after all,\\ndoes even the ideally perfect valid thought apply or refer to\\nreality? Its genuine subject is still beyond itself. At the last\\nLotze can dispose of this question only by regarding it as\\na metaphysical, not a logical, problem (Logic, II, 281, 282).\\nIn other words, logically speaking, we are at the end just\\n  \\n                            \\nexactly where we were at the beginning—in the sphere of\\nideas, and of ideas only, plus a consciousness of the necessity\\nof referring these ideas to a reality which is beyond them,\\nwhich is utterly inaccessible to them, which is out of reach\\nof any influence which they may exercise, and which \\ntranscends any possible comparison with their results. \"It is\\nvain,\" says Lotze, \"to shrink from acknowledging the circle\\nhere involved. . . . All we know of the external world \\ndepends upon the ideas of it which are within us\" (Logic, II,\\n185). \"It is then this varied world of ideas within us which\\nforms the sole material directly given to us\" (Logic, II,\\n186). As it is the only material given to us, so it is the only\\nmaterial with which thought can end. To talk about \\nknowing the external world through ideas which are merely\\nwithin us is to talk of an inherent self-contradiction. There\\nis no common ground in which the external world and our\\nideas can meet. In other words, the original separation \\nbetween an independent thought-material and an independent\\nthought-function and purpose lands us inevitably in the \\nmetaphysics of subjective idealism, plus a belief in an unknown\\nreality beyond, which although unknowable is yet taken as\\nthe ultimate test of the value of our ideas. At the end, after\\nall our maneuvering we are where we began:—with two\\nseparate disparates, one of meaning, but no existence, the\\nother of existence, but no meaning.\\nThe other aspect of Lotze\\'s contradiction which completes\\nthe circle is clear when we refer to his original propositions,\\nand recall that at the outset he was compelled to regard the\\norigination and conjunctions of the impressions, the \\nelements of ideas, as themselves the effects exercised by a world\\nof things already in existence (see p. 334). He sets up an\\nindependent world of thought, and yet has to confess that\\nboth at its origin and at its termination it points with \\nabsolute necessity to a world beyond itself. Only the stubborn\\nrefusal to take this initial and terminal reference of thought\\nbeyond itself as having a historic or temporal meaning, \\nindicating a particular place of generation and a particular\\npoint of fulfillment, compels Lotze to give such objective\\nreferences a transcendental turn.\\nWhen Lotze goes on to say (Logic, II, 191) that the\\n  \\n                            \\nmeasure of truth of particular parts of experience is found\\nin asking whether, when judged by thought, they are in\\nharmony with other parts of experience; when he goes on to\\nsay that there is no sense in trying to compare the entire\\nworld of ideas with a reality which is non-existent (excepting\\nas it itself should become an idea), he lands where he might\\nbetter have frankly commenced. Lotze even goes so far in this connection as to say that the\\nantithesis between our ideas and the objects to which they are\\ndirected is itself a part of the world of ideas (Logic, II, 192).\\nBarring the phrase \"world of ideas\" (as against world of con-tinuous\\ncontinuous experience), he need only have commenced at this point\\nto have traveled straight and arrived somewhere. But it is ab-solutely\\nabsolutely impossible to hold both this view and that of the\\noriginal independent existence of something given to and in\\nthought and an independent existence of a thought-activity,\\nthought-forms, and thought-contents.\\n»13 He saves himself from\\nutter scepticism only by claiming that the explicit \\nassumption of scepticism—the need of agreement of a ready-made\\nidea as such with an extraneous ready-made material as\\nsuch—is meaningless. He defines correctly the work of\\nthought as consisting in harmonizing the various portions of\\nexperience with each other. In this case the test of thought is\\nthe harmony or unity of experience actually effected. The\\ntest of validity of thought is beyond thought, just as at the\\nother limit thought originates out of a situation which is not\\ndependent upon thought. Interpret this before and beyond in\\na historic sense, as an affair of the place occupied and role\\nplayed by thinking as a function in experience in relation to\\nother non-intellectual experiences of things, and then the\\nintermediate and instrumental character of thought, its \\ndependence upon unreflective antecedents for its existence, and\\nupon a consequent experience for its final test, becomes \\nsignificant and necessary. Taken at large, apart from temporal\\ndevelopment and control, it plunges us in the depths of a\\nhopelessly complicated and self-revolving metaphysic.\\n  \\n                            \\n5. [On Mill and Whewell]\\nThe subsequent history of logical theory in England After Bacon.\\n»* is\\nconditioned upon its attempt to combine into one system the\\ntheories of empiristic logic with recognition of the procedure\\nof experimental science. This attempt finds its culmination\\nin the Logic of John Stuart Mill. Of his interest in and \\nfidelity to the actual procedure of experimental science, as he\\nsaw it, there can be no doubt. Of his good faith in concluding\\nhis Introduction with the words following there can be no\\ndoubt: \"I can conscientiously affirm that no one proposition\\nlaid down in this work has been adopted for the sake of\\nestablishing, or with any reference for its fitness in being\\nemployed in establishing, preconceived opinions in any \\ndepartment of knowledge or of inquiry on which the speculative\\nworld is still undecided.\" Yet Mill was equally attached to the\\nbelief that ultimate reality, as it is for the human mind, is\\ngiven in sensations, independent of ideas; and that all valid\\nideas are combinations and convenient ways of using such\\ngiven material. Mill\\'s very sincerity made it impossible that\\nthis belief should not determine, at every point, his treatment\\nof the thinking process and of its various instrumentalities.\\nIn Bk. III, Ch. 14, Mill discusses the logic of \\nexplanation, and in discussing this topic naturally finds it necessary\\nto consider the matter of the proper use of scientific \\nhypotheses. This is conducted from the standpoint of their use\\nas that is reflected in the technique of scientific discovery. In\\nBk. IV, Ch. 2, he discusses \"Abstraction or the Formation of\\nConceptions\"—a topic which obviously involves the forming\\nof hypotheses. In this chapter, his consideration is conducted\\nin terms, not of scientific procedure, but of general \\nphilosophical theory, and this point of view is emphasized by the\\nfact that he is opposing a certain view of Dr. Whewell.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe contradiction between the statements in the two\\nchapters will serve to bring out the two points already made,\\nviz., the correspondent character of datum and hypothesis,\\nand the origin of the latter in a problematic situation and its\\nconsequent use as an instrument of unification and solution.\\nMill first points out that hypotheses are invented to enable\\nthe deductive method to be applied earlier to phenomena;\\nthat it does this by suppressing the first of the three steps,\\ninduction, ratiocination, and verification. He states that:\\nThe process of tracing regularity in any complicated, and at\\nfirst sight confused, set of appearances is necessarily tentative;\\nwe begin by making any supposition, even a false one, to see\\nwhat consequences will follow from it; and by observing how\\nthese differ from the real phenomena, we learn what corrections\\nto make in our assumption. . . . Neither induction nor \\ndeduction would enable us to understand even the simplest phenomena,\\nif we did not often commence by anticipating the results; by\\nmaking a provisional supposition, at first essentially conjectural,\\nas to some of the very notions which constitute the final object\\nof the inquiry. Bk. III, Ch. 14, Sec. 5; italics mine. The latter part of the pas-sage\\npassage, beginning with the words \"If we did not often commence,\"\\netc., is quoted by Mill from Comte. The words \"neither induction\\nnor deduction would enable us to understand even the simplest\\nphenomena\" are his own.\\n»1\\nIf in addition we recognize that, according to Mill, our\\ndirect experience of nature always presents us with a \\ncomplicated and confused set of appearances, we shall be in no\\ndoubt as to the importance of ideas as anticipations of a\\npossible experience not yet had. Thus he says:\\nThe order of nature, as perceived at a first glance, presents\\nat every instant a chaos followed by another chaos. We must\\ndecompose each chaos into single facts. We must learn to see in\\nthe chaotic antecedent a multitude of distinct antecedents, in the\\nchaotic consequent a multitude of distinct consequents. Bk. III, Ch. 7, Sec. 1.\\n»2\\nIn the next section of the same chapter he goes on to state\\nthat, having discriminated the various antecedents and \\nconsequents, we then \"are to inquire which is connected with\\nwhich.\" This requires a still further resolution of the complex\\nand of the confused. To effect this we must vary the \\ncircumstances; we must modify the experience as given with\\n  \\n                            \\nreference to accomplishing our purpose. To accomplish this\\npurpose we have recourse either to observation or to \\nexperiment: \"We may either find an instance in nature suited to\\nour purposes, or, by an artificial arrangement of \\ncircumstances, make one\" (the italics in \"suited to our purpose\"\\nare mine; the others are Mill\\'s). He then goes on to say that\\nthere is no real logical distinction between observation and\\nexperimentation. The four methods of experimental inquiry\\nare expressly discussed by Mill in terms of their worth in\\nsingling out and connecting the antecedents and consequents\\nwhich actually belong together, from the chaos and \\nconfusion of direct experience.\\nWe have only to take these statements in their logical\\nconnection with each other (and this connection runs\\nthrough the entire treatment by Mill of scientific inquiry), to\\nrecognize the absolute necessity of hypothesis to undertaking\\nany directed inquiry or scientific operation. Consequently we\\nare not surprised at finding him saying that \"the function\\nof hypotheses is one which must be reckoned absolutely \\nindispensable in science\"; and again that \"the hypothesis by\\nsuggesting observations and experiments puts us on the road\\nto independent evidence.\" Bk. III, Ch. 14, Secs. 4 and 5.\\n»3\\nSince Mill\\'s virtual retraction, from the theoretical point\\nof view, of what is here said from the standpoint of scientific\\nprocedure, regarding the necessity of ideas is an \\naccompaniment of his criticism of Whewell, it will put the discussion\\nin better perspective if we turn first to Whewell\\'s views. William Whewell, The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,\\nLondon, 1840.\\n»4\\nThe latter began by stating a distinction which easily might\\nhave been developed into a theory of the relation of fact and\\nidea which is in line with that advanced in this chapter, and\\nindeed in this volume as a whole. He questions (Ch. 2) the\\nfixity of the distinction between theory and practice. He\\npoints out that what we term facts are in effect simply \\naccepted inferences; and that what we call theories are \\ndescribable as facts, in proportion as they become thoroughly\\nestablished. A true theory is a fact. \"All the great theories\\nwhich have successively been established in the world are\\n  \\n                            \\nnow thought of as facts.\" \"The most recondite theories when\\nfirmly established are accepted as facts; the simplest facts\\nseem to involve something of the nature of theory.\"\\nThe conclusion is that the distinction is a historic one,\\ndepending upon the state of knowledge at the time, and\\nupon the attitude of the individual. What is theory for one\\nepoch, or for one inquirer in a given epoch, is fact for some\\nother epoch, or even for some other more advanced inquirer\\nin the same epoch. It is theory when the element of inference\\ninvolved in judging any fact is consciously brought out; it\\nis fact when the conditions are such that we have never been\\nled to question the inference involved, or else, having \\nquestioned it, have so thoroughly examined into the inferential\\nprocess that there is no need of holding it further before\\nthe mind, and it relapses into unconsciousness again. \"If\\nthis greater or less consciousness of our own internal act be\\nall that distinguishes fact from theory, we must allow that\\nthe distinction is still untenable\" (untenable, that is to say,\\nas a fixed separation). Again, \"Fact and Theory have no\\nessential difference except in the degree of their certainty\\nand familiarity. Theory, when it becomes firmly established\\nand steadily lodged in the mind becomes Fact\" (p. 45;\\nitalics mine). And, of course, it is equally true that as fast\\nas facts are suspected or doubted, certain aspects of them\\nare transferred into the class of theories and even of mere\\nopinions.\\nI say this conception might have been developed in a\\nway entirely congruous with the position of this chapter.\\nThis would have happened if the final distinction between\\nfact and idea had been formulated upon the basis simply of\\nthe points, \"relative certainty and familiarity.\" From this\\npoint of view the distinction between fact and idea is one\\npurely relative to the doubt-inquiry function. It has to do\\nwith the evolution of an experience as regards its conscious\\nsurety. It has its origin in problematic situations. Whatever\\nappears to us as a problem appears as contrasted with a\\npossible solution. Whatever objects of thought refer \\nparticularly to the problematic side are theories, ideas, \\nhypotheses; whatever relates to the solution side is surety,\\nunquestioned familiarity, fact. This point of view makes the\\n  \\n                            \\ndistinctions entirely relative to the exigencies of the process\\nof reflective transformation of experience.\\nWhewell, however, had no sooner started in this train of\\nthought than he turns his back upon it. In Ch. 3 he \\ntransforms what he had proclaimed to be a relative, historic, and\\nworking distinction into a fixed and absolute one. He \\ndistinguishes between sensations and ideas, not upon a genetic\\nbasis with reference to establishing the conditions of further\\noperation; but with reference to a fundamentally fixed line\\nof demarcation between what is passively given to the mind\\nand the activity put forth by the mind. Thus he reinstates in\\nits most generalized and fixed, and therefore most vicious,\\nform the separation which he has just rejected. Sensations\\nare a brute unchangeable element of fact which exists and\\npersists independent of ideas; an idea is a mode of mental\\noperation which occurs and recurs in an independent \\nindividuality of its own. If he had carried out the line of\\nthought with which he began, sensation as fact would have\\nbeen that residuum of familiarity and certainty which cannot\\nbe eliminated, however much else of an experience is \\ndissolved in the inner conflict. Idea as hypothesis or theory\\nwould have been the corresponding element in experience\\nwhich is necessary to redintegrate this residuum into a \\ncoherent and significant experience.\\nBut since Whewell did not follow out his own line of\\nthought, choosing rather to fall back on the Kantian \\nantithesis of sense and thought, he had no sooner separated his\\nfact and idea, his given datum and his mental relation, than\\nhe is compelled to get them together again. The idea \\nbecomes a \"general relation which is imposed upon perception\\nby an act of the mind, and which is different from anything\\nwhich our senses directly offer to us\" (p. 26). Such \\nconceptions are necessary to connect the facts which we learn\\nfrom our senses into truths. \"The ideal conception which the\\nmind itself supplies is superinduced upon the facts as they\\nare originally presented to observation. Before the inductive\\ntruth is detected, the facts are there, but they are many and\\nunconnected. The conception which the discoverer applies\\nto them gives them connexion and unity\" (p. 42). All \\ninduction, according to Whewell, thus depends upon \\n  \\n                            \\nsuperinduction—imposition upon sensory data of certain ideas or\\ngeneral relations existing independently in the mind. The essential similarity between Whewell\\'s view and that of\\nLotze, already discussed (see Ch. 3) is of course explainable on\\nthe basis of their common relationship to Kant.\\n»5\\nWe do not need to present again the objections already\\noffered to this view: the impossibility of any orderly \\nstimulation of ideas by facts, and the impossibility of any check in\\nthe imposition of idea upon fact. \"Facts\" and conception are\\nso thoroughly separate and independent that any sensory\\ndatum is indifferently and equally related to any conceivable\\nidea. There is no basis for \"superinducing\" one idea or\\nhypothesis, rather than any other, upon any particular set of\\ndata.\\nIn the chapter already referred to upon abstraction, or\\nthe formation of conceptions, Mill seizes upon this difficulty.\\nYet he and Whewell have one point in common: they both\\nagree in the existence of a certain subject-matter which is\\ngiven for logical purposes quite outside of the logical process\\nitself. Mill agrees with Whewell in postulating a raw material\\nof pure sensational data. In criticizing Whewell\\'s theory of\\nsuperinduction of idea upon fact, he is therefore led to the\\nopposite assertion of the complete dependence of ideas as\\nsuch upon the given facts as such—in other words, he is led\\nto a reiteration of the fundamental Baconian empiricism;\\nand thus to a virtual retraction of what he had asserted \\nregarding the necessity of ideas to fruitful scientific inquiry,\\nwhether in the way of observation or experimentation. The\\nfollowing quotation gives a fair notion of the extent of Mill\\'s\\nretraction:\\nThe conceptions then which we employ for the colligation\\nand methodization of facts, do not develop themselves from\\nwithin, but are impressed upon the mind from without; they are\\nnever obtained otherwise than by way of comparison and \\nabstraction, and, in the most important and most numerous cases,\\nare evolved by abstraction from the very phenomena which it is\\ntheir office to colligate. Bk. IV, Ch. 2, Sec. 2; italics mine.\\n»6\\nEven here Mill\\'s sense for the positive side of scientific \\ninquiry suffices to reveal to him that the \"facts\" are somehow\\ninadequate and defective, and are in need of assistance from\\n  \\n                            \\nideas—and yet the ideas which are to help out the facts are\\nto be the impress of the unsure facts! The contradiction\\ncomes out very clearly when Mill says: \"The really difficult\\ncases are those in which the conception destined to create\\nlight and order out of darkness and confusion has to be\\nsought for among the very phenomena which it afterwards\\nserves to arrange.\" Logic, Sec. 4.\\n»7\\nOf course, there is a sense in which Mill\\'s view is very\\nmuch nearer the truth than is Whewell\\'s. Mill at least sees\\nthat \"idea\" must be relevant to the facts or data which it is\\nto arrange, which are to have \"light and order\" introduced\\ninto them by means of the idea. He sees clearly enough\\nthat this is impossible save as the idea develops within the\\nsame experience in which the \"dark and confused\" facts are\\npresented. He goes on to show correctly enough how \\nconflicting data lead the mind to a \"confused feeling of an\\nanalogy\" between the data of the confused experience and\\nof some other experience which is orderly (or already \\ncolligated and methodized); and how this vague feeling, through\\nprocesses of further exploration and comparison of \\nexperiences, gets a clearer and more adequate form until we finally\\naccept it. He shows how in this process we continually\\njudge of the worth of the idea which is in process of \\nformation, by reference to its appropriateness to our purpose. He\\ngoes so far as to say: \"The question of appropriateness is\\nrelative to the particular object we have in view.\" Logic, Sec. 4; in Sec. 6 he states even more expressly that any\\nconception is appropriate in the degree in which it \"helps us\\ntowards what we wish to understand.\"\\n»8 He sums\\nup his discussion by stating: \"We cannot frame good \\ngeneral conceptions beforehand. That the conception we have\\nobtained is the one we want can only be known when we\\nhave done the work for the sake of which we wanted it.\" Logic, Sec. 6; italics mine.\\n»9\\nThis all describes the actual state of the case, but it is\\nconsistent only with a logical theory which makes the \\ndistinction between fact and hypothesis instrumental in the\\ntransformation of experience from a confused into an \\norganized form; not with Mill\\'s notion that sensations are \\nsomehow finally and completely given as ultimate facts, and\\n  \\n                            \\nthat ideas are mere re-registrations of such facts. It is\\nperfectly just to say that the hypothesis is impressed upon\\nthe mind (in the sense that any notion which occurs to the\\nmind is impressed) in the course of an experience. It is well\\nenough, if one define what he means, to say that the \\nhypothesis is impressed (that is to say, occurs or is suggested)\\nthrough the medium of given facts, or even of sensations.\\nBut it is equally true that the facts are presented and that\\nsensations occur within the course of an experience which is\\nlarger than the bare facts, because involving the conflicts\\namong them and the corresponding intention to treat them\\nin some fashion which will secure a unified experience. Facts\\nget power to suggest ideas to the mind—to \"impress\"—only\\nthrough their position in an entire experience which is in\\nprocess of disintegration and of reconstruction—their \"fringe\"\\nor feeling of tendency is quite as factual as they are.

       " 'year: ': 1937,\n",
       " 'text: ': '\\n\\nBy T. V. Smith. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1936.\\nLet me say at the outset that Dr. Smith\\'s book is an\\ninterpretation of the actualities and possibilities of American politics\\nin moral terms, based upon sound psychology. But when I say\\nmoral, I do not mean moralistic—anything but that. He keeps\\nhis eye steadily upon human relations and associations and what\\nthey do and may do to make the lives of individuals who are\\ncaught up in these associations full and significant, for\\nthemselves and for others. This is the only meaning I can attach to\\n\"moral.\" The book displays imagination, but it is an imagination\\nso based upon the realities of our common American life that\\nimagination never degenerates into fantasy. The style in which\\nthe book is written accords with its substance; it is animated as\\nwell as lucid. The liveliness is not forced, but springs from a\\nconstant sense of the human conditions and forces that are playing\\nfor good and for ill in the American scene. It is not without\\nsignificance, I think, that upon the title page Dr. Smith prefers to\\nappear as Senator in the Illinois Senate rather than as a professor\\nin the University of Chicago.\\nThe first chapter is a tractate upon Individualism. The author\\nis aware how ambiguous is the meaning of the term, and points\\nout forcibly the necessity of arriving at clear ideas of \"What kind\\nof individualism, to whom applied, on what terms?\" The answer\\nis that individualism worth struggling for in American life is the\\ndevelopment of individuality in all alike, without favoritism, and\\nthat it \"has as its warp a pride and joy in cultural things, things\\nwhich can be enjoyed the more because not monopolized.\" The\\npromise held forth in American life is now hampered and more\\nor less frustrated by the unequal distribution of power, due to\\ninequality in the distribution of property and the attendant\\n  \\n                            \\nability of the few to control the lives of the many. But it is a\\ndominant, and to my mind genially cheerful, note of Dr. Smith\\'s\\ntreatment that he does not make economic conditions and power\\nends in themselves. He sees them as means of that fullness and\\nequality of the cultural development of individuals that is the\\ndeepest meaning of individualism.\\nI could wish that everyone interested in social and political\\naffairs would read and study the second chapter on Liberalism, the\\nwould-be friends of liberalism as well as those to whom it has\\nbecome a word of contempt because of appropriation by a group\\nto designate the liberty that is restricted to operation in\\neconomic affairs in their pecuniary aspect. Upon the political side,\\nhe points out that socialism may be a species of liberalism when\\nactual conditions require that individuals in order to live happily\\nmay have to depend upon governmental regulation and even\\nownership of property. \"To safeguard the liberty of the few is the very\\nessence of illiberalism.\" While government may own property\\nconsistently with liberalism, ownership of the thoughts and\\nactions of individual human beings is contrary to its intrinsic\\nsignificance. Hence the emphasis of liberalism upon liberty of speech\\nand thought, and liberty of consent—not as mere phrases, but\\nas things to be institutionally maintained at all costs. \"Since a\\ngovernment cannot be liberal save with a liberal people, the\\nimportant thing is to keep attention fixed upon society rather than\\nthe state.\" As an ideal, the principle that the best government is\\nthat which governs least is sound, for coercion is the opposite of\\nthe voluntary determination of belief and action that is the\\nessence of government by consent. But the ideal cannot be realized\\nuntil men and women in their social relations are genuinely able\\nto direct their thoughts and actions by free agreement with one\\nanother. They are not so able as long as economic and legal\\ninstitutions give the power of constraint and coercion to one group\\nof human beings over others. To realize the ideal of minimum\\ngovernmental action, government must intervene in order to\\nsecure the conditions of free and voluntary consensus of action\\namong individuals and communities. Only a free society can\\nbreed free individuals.\\nThe next two chapters discuss Fascism and Communism. While\\nthey are criticized upon the basis of principles that have emerged\\nin the chapters on Individualism and Liberalism, an outstanding\\n  \\n                            \\ntrait is the open mind displayed in apprehension of such values as\\nthey present. The discussion is taken out of the atmosphere of\\ncontroversial attack and defense that so usually envelops them\\ninto the clear light of principles. The essential virtue of Fascism\\n(Italian Fascism, not Naziism is discussed) is its emphasis upon\\nthe community. But in its moral aspect it rests upon the idea of\\npower and coercion to maintain power to such an extent that it\\nis, morally, \"an ethical pretender of the lowest rank.\"\\nThe discussion of Russian Communism is noteworthy for its\\nrecognition that the development of individuality for all is the\\nend and goal. Its weakness is bound to be the emphasis it places,\\nin common with Italian Fascism, upon coercive force as the\\nmeans of attaining the end. At the same time full justice is done\\nthe arguments by which the Bolshevist communist justifies,\\nrealistically and idealistically, his plea for the use of violence as\\nmeans. It is regarded as an evil but a necessary evil. Nevertheless,\\nRussian Communism has a contradiction, which is practical as\\nwell as logical, as its root. It assumes, if I may say it in this way,\\nthat ends are good and only good since they answer our hearts\\'\\ndesire, and hence the consequences that will actually result are\\nthose which we would like them to be rather than the\\nconsequences that will surely result from the means used. The\\ncommunists \"believe what they want to believe, and then obscure their\\naudacity by calling the result \\'science.\\'\" Lenin, in particular,\\nholds a copy of theory of social knowledge, which theory implies\\nthat it cannot be creative of the future. Russian Communism\\ninvolves the combination of use of immoral because strictly\\ncoercive means with a romantically impossible perfectionism of ends.\\nThe next chapter discusses, under the head of\\nParliamentarianism, the political techniques for making government the\\ninstrument of development of a free society that will breed and\\nnurse free individualities. The chapter does not gloss over the\\nconditions that have brought Parliamentarism into increasing\\ndisrepute. The causes of its decline are summed up in the statement\\nthat the political world is \"deserting intelligence at the very time\\nwhen intelligence has reached its highest development in\\nscience.\" The problem of the future validity of this method of\\npolitical action is, therefore, the problem of bringing available\\nintelligence to bear more directly and weightily upon representative\\ngovernment. The problem involves such matters as functional\\n  \\n                            \\nversus territorial selection of representatives, proportional\\nrepresentation, and, perhaps above all, what is termed \"creative\\ndeliberation among representatives.\" \"Art is required to pool the high\\ngeneral intelligence of legislators into a wise social whole.\" As it\\nis now, hearings before committees are meetings in which\\ncommittee members do not hear. In consequence, the governor—and\\nperhaps we may add the president—instead of confining himself\\nto the art of skilled administration, usurps the function of\\ndetermining policies. \"In the states the civil service is usually the\\nstepchild of politics; a label of skilled personnel to cover the\\npatronage system at its worst.\" This fact prevents executives from being\\nwhat they are supposed to be, while legislatures, on the other\\nhand, waste \"their energies in unconcerted talk.\"\\nFor the final chapter upon Americanism, I must for the most\\npart refer to the text itself, as my review has already grown too\\nlong. But I cannot abstain from calling attention to the\\nnoteworthy section upon the development in our politics of the doctrine\\nand practice of judicial supremacy—especially as the journal in\\nwhich this review is published is addressed to an audience of\\nlawyers. The sections on the place of the middle-class and the\\nfunction of women in politics are not to be neglected. I close by\\nsaying that I can imagine no happier omen for the realization of\\nthe promise of American politics than a very wide reading of this\\nbook by the citizens in general and politicians in particular.\\n  \\n'}"

       " 'text: ': '\\n: A Syllabus of Lectures in Advanced Ethics.\\n\\nBy W. R. Benedict, Professor of Philosophy in the University of Cincinnati.Cincinnati University Press, 1902.\\nI am glad to have an opportunity of calling attention to\\nthis little volume of a hundred pages, prepared as a syllabus\\naccompanying collegiate lectures. No one would doubt for a\\nmoment that all systems of philosophy, or World Views,\\ncarry with them implications of the utmost significance for\\nconduct; few would deny that one of the main motifs in the\\ngeneration of philosophic systems has been the consciousness\\nof certain ultimate issues as to morality, the possibility of\\nrationally valuing life as worthy or unworthy. Such being\\nthe case, it is a striking fact that there is almost a total lack\\nof literature upon the inherent bearings of philosophic \\nstandpoints and outlooks upon the moral problems of life. The\\ngreat writers, Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, turn up, of course,\\nboth in histories of metaphysics as such, and in histories of\\nethics as such; but rarely do we have a consideration of what\\nthe metaphysical view means, per se, when translated into\\nethical equivalents. Professor Benedict\\'s book is worthy of\\nrecognition as a sincere and rational attempt at just this\\ntranslation.\\nMoreover, the way the test is undertaken is worthy of\\nnote. Self-imposed limitations practically exclude periods \\nbefore Kant—an outcome specially to be deplored, I think, in\\nthe case of Spinoza, who is an unapproachable instance of\\nan organic union of a typical World View with a typical\\ntheory of life; one which, while analogous in some regards\\nto the Idealistic Monism, finally adopted and expounded by\\nProfessor Benedict, has its distinctive points. There is an\\naccount of the ethical implications of the systems of Kant,\\nFichte, Schelling, Hegel and Schopenhauer, occupying about\\nhalf the volume, while the remainder discusses the ethical\\nimplications of systems as such: Dualism, and, under \\nMonism, Materialism and Idealism. The historical account might\\n  \\n                            \\nperhaps be criticized on the ground that in the case of Fichte\\nthe treatment falls short of the ideal held in view in the\\nbook, and also of the possibilities of the case. It is brief and\\nthere is little rendering of Fichte\\'s theory of knowledge and\\nbeing into their ethical evaluations; Fichte\\'s system might\\nbe made very fruitful as a type-case of an effort to construe\\nthe whole universe in terms of the moral standpoint as such.\\nDualism is rejected on the ground that its ethical \\ncorrelates are an unsolvable antagonism of good and bad, \\nanimal and spiritual, principles in man\\'s life, whose logical\\noutcome is asceticism, and an assumption of an arbitrary\\nstruggle of external forces. Materialism is welcomed in so far\\nas it represents a movement toward unity; but is criticized on\\nthe ground that it attempts to define existence apart from\\nexistence-for-consciousness, which is impossible. Moreover, it\\nis contended that science itself in its apparently most \\nmaterialistic conquest, physiological psychology, really transcends\\nmaterialism. \"Matter has drawn very close to consciousness.\\nHere, in the consciousness which brain makes possible, is\\nthe explanation of matter, the reason for matter, and the\\nreason in matter\" (p. 72).\\nIt is impossible to summarize the idealistic Monism set\\nforth by Professor Benedict, because the account is itself but\\nthe summary appropriate to a syllabus. It is in line with\\ncertain recent renditions of Hegel, notably Bradley\\'s and\\nRoyce\\'s, but is truer to Hegel, in the reviewer\\'s mind, as well\\nas more satisfactory in itself, in laying greater stress upon\\nthe positive significance of conflict and the suffering that\\nattends it, in the constitution of an active and worthful \\nuniverse, instead of tending to give a negative interpretation of\\nconflict as due to the \"finite\" over against the complete, or\\nto \"appearance\" over against Reality. It is to be hoped that\\nProfessor Benedict will give in ample form what he has set\\nforth here in outline. Especially noteworthy is the temper in\\nwhich Professor Benedict holds to the irrationality of a\\ndemand for finality—for absolute explanation—upon one side,\\nwhile, upon the other, he insists upon the moral duty of\\nadopting as a hypothesis that world-view which, all things\\ntaken into account, seems to serve relatively best the \\npurpose of rationalizing existence and life.\\n  \\n                            \\n'}"

       "'The Later Works of John Dewey, 1925-1953. Volume 17 / Unpublished writings / Unpublished Writings\\nThe Historical Method in Ethics [Address delivered to the Philosophical Club, University of Chicago, 4 December\\n1901. Typescript, not typed by Dewey, in the Joseph Ratner/John Dewey Papers,\\nBox 44, folder 7, Special Collections, Morris Library, Southern Illinois University\\nat Carbondale, and in the Henry Waldgrave Stuart Papers, Stanford University\\nLibraries, Stanford, Calif.]\\n»»\\nThe remarks of my paper have arisen in connection with\\nthe course I am giving at present, where I am dealing with the\\nhistorical development of conduct, and which has led from this\\nto a consideration of the possibility of a science of morality. I\\nhave naturally arrived at the foregone conclusion that there is a\\nscience of morality possible, and I have further concluded that\\nthe condition of a scientific treatment of morality is in the use of\\na universal method; in other words, that it is only by a historical\\nmethod that matters of moral conduct can take the form of a\\nscience. It seems to me there are positive data which consist of\\npractices and beliefs and ideals or aspirations,—that is, a body\\nof fact which is in existence just as much as are the facts with\\nwhich the sciences of meteorology or physics deal. My thesis is\\nthat it is only by using an historical method that we can put these\\nfacts in that sort of order or get them under control so as to\\nconsider them scientific. There are one or two objections.\\nOne is that no science of morality is possible because morality\\ndeals with what ought to be, and science deals with facts that\\nare, that science is by its nature descriptive and explanation only\\ngrows out of description, and that obligation, the ought, is\\nsomething the nature of which eludes description. It is not a fact or\\nevent. It is not a phenomenon. The objection seems to me much\\nmore specious than sound. I should dispose of it briefly by saying\\nthat there are ought facts just as much as there are is facts. It\\nseems to me almost a verbal catch to say that you cannot have a\\nscience of what ought to be because what ought to be is not, but\\n  \\n                            \\nsimply ought to be. It is a fact that the human race presents to\\nitself certain relations in terms of obligation just as much as it\\npresents other facts to itself in terms of heat or electricity or\\nlight, and there is a perfectly definite body of these facts. Some\\nthings are regarded as ought facts by some, and others are so\\nregarded by other people. Now, we may say that moral ideals are\\nunrealized or utterly unrealizable; none the less, the ideals are\\nfacts; they exist as facts, and they influence other facts. There\\nare efforts put forth to realize them or put forth in relation to\\nthem. There is a struggle, and there is at least a varying measure\\nof failure and success in reaching them. It is those things which\\ngive us a positive and definite body of data. In fact, it is difficult\\nto deal with the objection because it is difficult to get the force of\\nit. It seems almost a catch to say that because your facts relate to\\nobligations that they therefore relate to something which are not\\nfacts and therefore cannot be discussed scientifically.\\nAn objection of another sort not so often stated as\\npresupposed is that morally the facts are so individual that they escape\\nscientific description and analysis and explanation. In popular\\nphraseology we have the idea of the rights of the private\\nconscience and the sacred character of conscience; or, as stated\\nin religious language, a man\\'s conscience is a thing between\\nhim and his God. It is so peculiar and unique individually that\\nthe facts of it do not come within the sphere of scientific\\ntreatment. This seems to me a peculiar sort of egoism. Romanticism\\nis egoism wherever it shows itself, whether in literature or\\npuritanical morality or in some sort of consciousness. It may be\\ngotten around by calling to mind that, if our own ego and moral\\naffairs are of such great importance, so are everyone else\\'s.\\nAn adequate discussion of what science is would take up a\\nwhole evening, but perhaps a standpoint may be suggested which,\\neven if not agreed to, will serve to make the rest of the discussion\\na little more intelligible. I mean by science a definite control of\\nour interpretation of facts, that is, some kind of method for\\nregulating the meaning that we assign to facts, or a method of\\ncontrolling the judgments that we form. These are flexible\\ndefinitions, but necessarily so. ^Aristotle said that science was relative\\nto the body of facts that are being dealt with. In so far as in\\nany of these subjects we get a definite method of regulating the\\njudgments that we pass and discriminate them, in so far we have\\nscience.\\n  \\n                            \\nThis is what I mean by the control of interpretation: the\\nprocess of control, the intellectual attitude that we take, and\\nconsequently the meaning that we assign to these facts. Control of\\njudgment leads to control of the experience itself, and\\nintellectual control tends to pass over into particular control. If we\\nknow how to pass right judgments, for instance on electrical\\ndata, we are pretty sure also to be able to control our experiences\\nthat have to do with those things. In so far as we know how to\\nassign meanings to facts and objects, there is a presumption that\\nwe will be able to secure also those values or meanings that we\\nwant and to avoid those which we do not want. I mention that\\nbecause it suggests that, if we can control our final judgments, it\\nwould not stop at that point with simply a better interpretation\\nof the facts themselves, but from analogy at least we should\\nexpect that the control would extend itself into a control of\\nexperience itself. The confusion that exists at present, for instance, in\\nthe interpretation of conduct I suppose no one would deny has a\\ntendency to confuse action and conduct. If, therefore, we could\\nclarify our judgment of conduct, it would give us a guidance to\\nthe actual conduct itself. If it is possible to control our\\ninterpretation of our moral experience, to get some kind of technique,\\nsome kind of method into the way in which we pass judgment on\\nacts, conduct, or character, the question comes up, where shall\\nwe look for that method? If we attempt to rule out all the\\nmethods that seem to us unsatisfactory I would not agree to the main\\npoint. I do not see how any amount of direct inspection of moral\\nfacts will enable us to control our judgment in any way, though it\\nmay be a preliminary step in that direction. The simple fact is\\nthat we take this direct inspection and direct reflection upon us.\\nAs they now present themselves we are dealing with judgments\\nthat are already formed. We are committed necessarily by all the\\njudgments that we have previously passed, and we may\\nincidentally get rid by more systematic observation and reflection\\nand comparison of some of the inconsistent elements in these\\njudgments, so modify them and make them cohere with each\\nother. After all, our standard remains in judgments that we have\\nalready formed. We do not get beyond simply rendering those\\njudgments more consistent with each other. We do not get back\\nof the process itself. It is exactly the same as if we tried to make\\nphysical science simply by comparing all the observations that\\nhad already been made, extending them somewhat, and then\\n  \\n                            \\nsorting out and classifying them. It was a preliminary step in\\nscience, but the standard still remained the judgments that had\\nalready been passed, while what was wanted was to get away\\nfrom these judgments to reform them, to change the process. On\\nthe other hand, we cannot dissect these moral facts. We cannot\\nbring reagents to bear upon them. The methods of physical\\nexperiments are clearly not available.\\nNow, if neither direct inspection nor reflection upon our moral\\nobservations is possible, it suggests at least by way of elimination\\nthat we try the historical method. The idea that I shall try to\\nbring out is that the historical method does do for data which\\nexists in our miscellaneous experience what the experimental\\nmethod does for physical facts. The historical and the\\nexperimental methods are identical, not in their outward relation, but\\ntheir ultimate logical factors and logical aims. I shall go so far as\\nto try to show that the experimental method is itself a form of the\\nhistorical method, as well as the method applied in the only way\\nin which it is available to these conscious data.\\nThe business of experimentation is to define any given fact by\\nstating exhaustively the conditions of its origin, the conditions\\nunder which that fact appears. All the conquests that have been\\nmade for human knowledge by the experimental method have\\nbeen made simply by sticking to that very simple proposition. We\\nwill go behind the given fact to see what the conditions are which\\nare necessary to the appearance of that fact. There are words\\nwhich are always used by everyone, as well as by scientific men\\nand by writers on logic which convey that idea, although the\\nwords are frequently used without seeing all that is understood\\nin them. We say we are dealing with facts or with consequences,\\nand we are trying to refer the consequences to their antecedents\\nor the effects to their causes. By this we mean that we are\\ninterested in discussing the fact from the standpoint of its appearance\\nin a time series. Science is not at all interested in facts in\\nthemselves as facts. It has nothing to do with that question. It is\\ninterested in the facts taken in relation to the historical antecedents,\\nthat is, the conditions which have to present themselves in order\\nthat this fact may show itself; though, if that proposition\\nregarding the nature of experimentation is correct, at least we will be\\nprepared to admit that in some more or less general sense the\\nhistorical method is the correct one.\\n  \\n                            \\nWe might say that in physical experimentation we are\\nmaking history and the reason that the experiment has its value is\\nprecisely because we are making the history; consequently the\\nsequence is under control, while in history we read an account of\\nan experiment that has been already tried. There of course is the\\nless degree of certainty, the greater degree of complexity in the\\nproblem on the historical side. What we call history we do not\\nmake when we come to deal with it scientifically. We have to\\nread it back into the terms of the antecedent and consequent\\nwhich is therefore much less under direct control than when we\\ncan go ahead and make the history ourselves, as every scientist\\ndoes in the laboratory. Experimental science is essentially then\\ngenetic science and the scientific value of the experimentation\\nconsists in the fact that the method pursued is genetic. Physics\\nand chemistry give us pure history, so far as the experiment\\nfurnishes its ideals. When we analyze water, and say that water is\\nH2O of course it is that, simply from the standpoint of science; it\\nis not really that; it is a liquid, a thing which we drink.\\nIf I had time I should like to try to show why it is that we do\\nnot recognize commonly the historical character and the genetic\\ncharacter of the physical sciences. The obvious distinction will\\noccur to you at once in what we are accustomed to call history;\\nnot merely the particular sequence is of importance, but the\\nentire context in which that finds itself. In the physical sciences\\nwe are accustomed to think of particular sets of antecedents and\\nconsequents recurring at any particular point in the whole series.\\nNot only do we have these pieces or samples of water appearing\\nwhen proper historical conditions have been present, but we\\nhave them occurring and recurring at any point, theoretically\\nspeaking any place in the entire series. Now, it is not true that a\\ncertain piece of water shows itself more than once, any more\\nthan it is true that George Washington or Napoleon Bonaparte\\nshow themselves more than once. It is always individual water.\\nNow, any water which is not an abstraction is truly here but\\nonce. It can come at only one point in the historical series. It is\\nunique. When it is there, it is there for the first time, just as if it\\nwere a special creation made by the deity, and when it is gone it\\ndoes not come back. When we get water again it is another\\nwater, so far as its existence is concerned. Existences in the\\nphysical side are just as unique and just as individual as those of\\n  \\n                            \\npersons and acts. Where the difference does come in is that the\\nmeaning is not unique. On the physical side, one piece or one\\nsample of water is just as good as another, provided it is water. It\\nserves the same purpose. It has the same value. It is only on the\\nside of meaning that this interchange takes place, not on the side\\nof existence. Water from the nearest faucet will slake our thirst\\njust as well as water from the Pierian spring. If the water had\\nanything to say about it, it would make just the same objection\\nto being regarded as simply universal and reappearing at any\\npoint as an historical character would.\\nNow, the next point in my argument, to carry this comparison\\na little further, is to try to show that experimentation is historical\\nin character, but that in the progress of the experiment we have\\ntwo factors in the employment of the historical method in moral\\nmatters. All scientific matters go back to isolation and\\naccumulation. The scientist must first isolate the fact that he wants to deal\\nwith, so that he can ignore a large number of other facts with\\nwhich it is physically in juxtaposition. He has got to simplify\\nconditions to such an extent that he will be able to identify\\nexactly what he is dealing with, and rule out a lot of\\ncomplications, a lot of surrounding facts which to immediate observation\\nare common sense, are connected with the fact,—are a part of it.\\nIf he is going to make an analysis of water he must be sure he is\\ndealing with pure water, in order that he may control all the\\nvarious facts that enter into the experiment. A large part of the\\ntechnique of the science consists simply in being sure that no factors\\nare operating there except those which we have recognized and\\nintend to be operating there. We cannot get this exclusive\\nknowledge of the conditions under which a fact shows itself excepting\\nas we can put in the facts that we want there and put out the\\nthings that we do not want there. On the historical side we get\\nour parallel with that in the primitive phenomena. The earlier\\nthe fact shows itself, the farther back we can trace it in the\\nhistorical series, the more we escape the complications with\\nwhich all moral facts are overlaid as they present themselves to\\nus. The earlier terms of the historical series have the value of\\npresenting the phenomenon in question in something like\\nreduction to its lowest terms, to the minimum of meaning and of\\ncontent attaching to it, and so far as I can see, by going back and\\nback we get the phenomenon reduced,—we get it stated in its\\n  \\n                            \\nlowest terms. Speaking again relatively, we carry it over from one\\nsubject to another and get it laid bare, we get it isolated. Some\\none has said that the value of evolution is that it takes the lid off\\nof the universe. It uncovers the crust,—the complications which\\nfrom our present standpoint have grown up everywhere. The\\ngenetic method, using the term in its ordinary sense, gives us\\nthe analysis exactly comparable to the isolation and separation\\nwhich we find in experimental science.\\nThe ideal of the physical scientist is, after he has gotten a\\nnumber of simple conditions and knows what the effect of each\\nof these is, to proceed cumulatively, to put them together. He\\nproceeds to build up synthetically more and more complex\\nstructures; on the one hand, he tries to isolate and then put together\\nthe things which have been isolated, and build up again a\\ncomplexity which differs from the original complexity which was\\npresented to the mind because it has been through this process of\\nconscious disintegration and of conscious reconstruction. The\\nfirst time the fact was given to us we could not control it. So far\\nas we realized it, we had to know what it was, and what it\\nwas like, because we made the fact, and it would be a pity if we\\ncould not know something about the objects of our own\\nmanufacture, and through this combination and interacting analysis\\nand synthesis we change the present static facts of our experience\\ninto complicated facts that have been brought about through a\\nseries of steps of our own, and we get in control of these facts just\\nbecause we have passed through that process of demonstration\\nand re-creating of our own. It is the later steps of the historical\\nperiod that give us this cumulative force. If we can trace a\\nrelation clear back, we get it into its simplest form, and then the\\nproblem is to see how it worked itself out, to see how it shows\\nitself in more complex environs in a high degree of civilization\\nand culture, where of course the problem is more complicated.\\nThere seems to me no difference in the essential logic of the case.\\nIt is a process of unraveling on one side; but going back to\\nthe most primitive materials available, we can see how these\\nunraveled threads are woven together until finally we get back to\\ntoday, and the civilization of today, and the moral civilization of\\ntoday, and moral ideals and practices and conduct, and have\\ngotten facts which we can look at although not made by us\\nindividually in this case, but made by others who had like ourselves\\n  \\n                            \\nreceived them, since they had been made by a long experiment\\nwhich has been going on for centuries and in which humanity as\\na whole has had its share.\\nThrough the history we get our present data which are so\\nconfusing, so real. We see them in relation to a process, and thereby\\ncan know how to place them. We have got a control. We have\\nfound out under what situation people came to regard a certain\\nact as of value and as desirable, and by following it through\\nits subsequent history we get a test of it. We get knowledge along\\nthree lines. (1) What was the situation which called forth a\\ncertain moral reaction, whether in the way of an ideal or practice?\\nWhat was the setting, the situation which arose, which was the\\nstimulus to this moral conception or practice? (2) Did it function\\nadequately in that situation? Did it meet the requirements which\\ncalled it forth? Was it simply a blind or unsuccessful reaction, or\\nwas it an adequate reaction?\\nHaving historically taken to pieces and put together again our\\npresent moral situation, we can carry over the result of that\\njudgment into our present interpretation and to some extent into our\\npresent practice, in so far as the same situation persists, or a\\nsituation which in its more important phases is the same. In\\nso far as the situation has changed or modified itself, the\\nnecessity of some change in the reaction takes place. Or, we can go\\nfurther. It is the knowledge of the moralizing process that is\\nimportant, not simply the knowledge in itself, though sometimes\\nthings were gotten at by a mere accumulation of those bare facts,\\nwhich, however, would not take anybody very far; but if we have\\nthe whole social and economic situation that called them out and\\nthe reaction they had upon their control of their environment\\nand control of their own life, we get an insight into the moral\\nprocess and thus can view the present situation to see what the\\nprocesses are which are at work.\\nI will close with two points more on the philosophical side\\nof the whole matter. The value of the earlier event in time is\\nreally one of method, one of giving us insight into the later\\nconditions. The material fallacy is transforming this superior logical\\nvalue into an ontological value, considering the earlier in time\\nthe cause and such more real things as reality, what comes\\nlater, more complex and more spiritual and accordingly only an\\ninferior degree of existence or to some extent illusory. It is this\\n  \\n                            \\ntendency to degrade the latter terms of the series to the reality of\\nthe earlier that causes the ordinary opposition to the application\\nof evolutionary method. The material point of view realizes the\\nvalue of getting all things to their simplest terms; for instance,\\nfrom a logical scientific point of view, taking primitive ideas has\\ncertain advantages. The material point of view takes abstractions\\nas if they were real facts, some superior absolute value in the way\\nof existence belonging to a thing because it came earlier. Should\\nthe cause have primary existence in its own right? I cannot see\\nthat things are any better because they come earlier in time. All\\nwe know about a thing called cause or antecedent is what comes\\nafter. We would not be able to make an intelligent statement\\nabout it. It is only by seeing and knowing its consequences that\\nwe can get any meaning from it as a cause. This conception, that\\nif we only knew perfectly say the original nebula or the other\\nthings from which the whole physical universe has descended,\\nwe could have prophesied everything that has happened since, is\\na purely tautological statement. The only way we could have had\\na knowledge of it in the beginning is by knowing what came after\\nit and what came out of it. Take the relation of hydrogen to\\nwater. We know that water is made of hydrogen and oxygen, but\\nwe would not know one single thing about hydrogen if we did\\nnot know the thing which it made. The whole proposition is a\\nreciprocal one. And so when the materialist (in a rather wide\\nsense) says that because our present morality has grown up out\\nof savage morality, and that it is therefore nothing but savage\\nmorality shifted around and dressed up by a little different\\nassociation, he is confusing these matters of superior values with the\\nsuper-ontological values and contradicts his actual argument.\\nIt is that which made the ordinary ethical writer object to\\napplying this at all. He says this deprives them of all their real value\\nand meaning. It puts the cart before the horse. It does not\\nexplain but simply explains away by reducing all to their simplest\\nform. If that was what the historical method really did, this\\nobjection would be well founded. The idealist falls into exactly\\nthe same error from the other end. He assumes that the last\\nthing has a superior and a finer value, and that everything that\\nhas gone before has to be interpreted as a sort of half-baked\\ninadequate attempt to get what we have now gotten. The\\nsignificant thing is the process of moralization and that process\\n  \\n                            \\nshows itself both in primitive morality and in such morals as\\nwe have now. There is no more finality attaching to our present\\nstock of ethical conceptions. The only thing that does have\\nfinality is the relation between the process, between a situation, and a\\ncertain way of looking at that situation which exists now and all\\nthe time.\\n  \\n                            \\nKnowledge and Existence [Typescript, not typed by Dewey, in the John Dewey Papers, Box 51, folder 14,\\nSpecial Collections, Morris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale,\\nca. 1909. For Frederick J. E. Woodbridge\\'s article to which this is a reply, see \\n\"Consciousness and Meaning,\" Psychological Review 15 (November 1908): 397-98\\n(print edition, Appendix 5).]\\n»»\\nI. A Realistic Theory of Their Relation\\nIt is a great gain in the discussion of any problem when\\nsimplification can be introduced; energy hitherto wasted is\\nconserved from dissipation and, at the same time, the simplification\\nreveals the exact point upon which energy may be fruitfully\\nconcentrated. Professor Woodbridge\\'s treatment of the relation\\nof knowledge to existence seems to possess many of the traits of a\\nfar-reaching simplification of this sort. In brief, the position is\\nthis: Things, existences, objects, facts, Later we may see reasons for differentiating these terms. At present, they are\\nused indifferently.\\n»1 are just what they are out\\nof knowledge and in knowledge. Nevertheless knowledge adds\\nsomething: viz., known objects qua known mean certain other\\nobjects. Smoke has itself, independent of its being known, a\\ncertain constitution and properties. When smoke is known, these\\nremain just what they were, but there is added the further\\nproperty of standing as a sign—say of fire. Smoke results from fire\\nirrespective of the knowledge relation; but that smoke indicates\\n(means) fire is as much a function of the knowledge relation\\nas its density, color, etc., are a function of its physical\\nrelations. In this view, moreover, consciousness, mind, etc., are\\nneither things, essences, stuffs, \\'end-terms,\\' nor mere illusory\\nepiphenomena: they are names for the existence of precisely this\\nadded relation of meaning among things.\\nIt would be a grateful task to point out the numerous and\\n  \\n                            \\nprofound simplifications involved in acceptance of this point of\\nview—the problems eliminated as factitious, the genuine\\nproblems that are defined and concentrated. But my office here is the\\nmore ungrateful one of a sceptical questioner. My questions\\nrelate however not to the truth or falsity of any particular\\nproposition, but to the logical relations existing among them.\\nThe propositions are (1) Knowledge is a meaning-relation. (2)\\nThings that enter into knowledge remain the same that they\\nwere out of it—save, of course, the assumption of the meaning-\\nrelation. (3) Consciousness and the meaning-relation are\\ncoextensive, denotatively and connotatively.\\nI. If we start from the first and third we seem obliged to deny\\nthe second: which does not imply however the assertion of the\\ncontrary, but only the meaninglessness of any proposition either\\nway. For if all knowledge is meaning-relation and this relation is\\ncoextensive with \\'consciousness\\' in every way, it does not seem\\npossible to make any reference to or raise any question about\\nobjects \\'out of knowledge,\\' whether like or unlike. II. If we start\\nwith the second and the third, in combination, the first becomes\\nimpossible; or if we try to combine the second and the first, we\\nfind it necessary to restate the second. For the possibility of\\nupholding the second seems to depend upon holding that\\nknowledge is not a meaning-relation, but direct prehension or intuition\\nof what already exists, while the doctrine that knowledge is\\nmeaning-relation indicates that the objects or facts which\\nexpress its outcome have undergone radical change as respects the\\n\"things\" that assumed the meaning-relation.\\nI. As to the consistency of the doctrine of the inclusiveness of\\nthe meaning-relation (or its identification with \"consciousness\"),\\nwith the notion of any reference beyond \"consciousness.\" Here,\\nthe antinomy that presents itself is this: Thesis—Unless there\\nis reference of the meaning-relation beyond itself (involving of\\ncourse the elements qua elements in this relation), there is no\\nknowledge. Antithesis—But if \\'consciousness\\' is coextensive, in\\ndenotation and connotation, with this relation no such reference\\nis possible. Let us recur to the smoke-fire instance. Unless the\\nsmoke has characteristics that are independent of its meaning\\nfire, and unless the fire has characteristics independent of its\\nbeing meant by smoke and unless connection between these\\n  \\n                            \\ncharacteristics is involved in smoke meaning fire, there is no such\\nthing as smoke meaning fire. Probably the simplest way to\\nappreciate these considerations is to refer to the possibility of a\\nsituation in which two things are co-present simply by way of\\nsuggestion. Smoke may suggest fire with no belief in fire beyond its\\nbeing suggested—as it may suggest a face. The fire thus\\nsuggested and not believed in may suggest hell without any belief in\\nhell. In this case, neither the fire suggesting nor the hell suggested\\nhas any implications whatsoever beyond the situation. There is\\nno knowledge, because there is no meaning-relation. There is\\nonly a suggestive relation in virtue of which certain things are co-\\npresent. Generalizing all \"consciousness\" reduces itself to such\\nbare co-presence of \"associated\" elements, the elements having\\nno reference beyond the bare fact of their association.\\nMy intention is not at all to show that since there are such\\nsituations, the view that consciousness is equivalent to a\\nmeaning-relation is incorrect. I use this matter of suggestion-relation\\nonly as a hypothetical illustration to enforce the proposition that\\nit can be said that S means P, only when both S and P have\\nimplications outside this S - P situation.\\nSo far, we are only in line with Professor Woodbridge\\'s teaching\\nas to things outside of the meaning-relation that are presupposed\\nby it. But now let us consider the other proposition: The\\nsignificance relation is denotatively and connotatively the equivalent of\\nconsciousness. On this basis, what is meant by the reference to\\nthings outside of this relation? How is it possible even to refer\\nto them? And yet if it is not possible to refer to them, there is\\nno meaning-relation, no knowledge. Prior to the question, then,\\nwhether entering \\'consciousness\\' alters in any way things as they\\nexist outside of \\'consciousness\\' is the question whether upon the\\nbasis of the identification of \\'consciousness\\' with knowledge as\\ndefined, any reference to such outside things is possible?\\nThis difficulty has been felt by others, notably by Professor\\nBode. In reply, Professor Woodbridge has said: \"It is not the\\n\\'awareness\\' of a fact that makes the fact a fact of a particular\\nkind in consciousness; it is that in its own right. The simple\\nexistence of the fact in consciousness appears to be all that\\nis involved in \\'awareness of the fact as fact.\\' But let the fact\\nmean something and its meaning appears to be identical with\\n  \\n                            \\n\\'awareness of it as meaning something.\\'\" Psychological Review, November, 1908, p. 398 [this volume, p. 543 (print edition)].\\n»2 We have here a\\npeculiar situation. Professor Woodbridge gives as a resolution of a\\ndifficulty a proposition that seems to me to state the difficulty. If\\nwe invert the second sentence—and the proposition seems to\\nintend equivalence—it reads \"all that is involved in \\'awareness\\nof the fact as fact\\' is precisely the simple existence of the fact\\nin consciousness.\" In other words there is no reference beyond\\n\\'consciousness.\\' To say a fact exists is to say it exists in\\nconsciousness; and this (as we have seen) involves the\\nsubstitution of bare existential co-presence for a meaning-relation, and\\nhence the denial of knowledge as defined. Or putting the matter\\nthe other way, the second and the third sentences quoted have,\\non the basis of Professor Woodbridge\\'s identification of\\nconsciousness and meaning-relation, exactly the same force,—while\\nto be a solution of the difficulty urged they should have a\\ndifferent force, i.e., put the matters referred to on a different footing.\\nThe expression \"the simple existence of the fact in\\nconsciousness\" means, by definition, existence in a meaning-relation and\\nso is exactly equivalent to the expression (in the third sentence)\\n\"let the fact mean something.\" Hence, the only awareness of the\\nfact possible is the awareness of it as meaning something which\\nin turn we are aware of only as meant. And this, as we have\\nalready seen, is the destruction of the meaning-relation itself.\\nThis contradiction is surely the reductio ad absurdum of one of\\nthe premises from which it follows: viz., either that knowledge is\\na meaning-relation or that knowledge and \\'consciousness\\' are\\ncoextensive.\\nII. Let us check up this result by trying the first and second\\npropositions in combination. Knowledge is a meaning-relation\\nbetween things which are the same \\'in\\' as \\'out\\' of the relation.\\nHere the alternatives of the dilemma are: If it can be intelligently\\nasserted that things are the same without as within the meaning-\\nrelation, then knowledge is direct prehension of fact, and the\\nexistence of a meaning-relation is a token of deficiency of fact\\nand hence of knowledge. Or, on the other hand, if the meaning-\\nrelation is genuine, not illusory, and if it identifies knowledge,\\nthen \"things\" are transformed by assuming it.\\n(1) Says Professor Woodbridge (article cited, page 397 [this\\n  \\n                            \\nvolume, p. 543 (print edition)]), \"Take the water again. When it is unknown—\\nmeaning thereby when it is not an object in consciousness—is it\\nlacking in particular chemical and physical properties? Does it\\ntake on these properties—or lose them—only in consciousness?\\nIf it can have properties both in consciousness and out of it, there\\nis no necessity of adding anything to them to make them just\\nthose properties when they are in consciousness.\" This seems to\\nstate exactly the difficulty. The water and its properties referred\\nto as fact are known; they are defined. They are known moreover\\nas the outcome of long scientific inquiry. History shows that\\nmany different and incompatible properties have been attributed\\nto the constitution of water, that much has been taken for water\\nthat is not H2O; hence not what has been taken to be water, but\\n\"real water,\" as we say, water which is known to be a certain\\nthing with certain properties, must be referred to by the\\nproposition. Hence the force of the passage quoted would seem to\\nbe that objects qua objects (as distinct from what they are\\nfrom time to time taken to be), facts qua facts (as distinct from\\nour opinions about them), do not change in passing from one\\nknowledge relation to another. Of unknowable objects there\\nwould be no sense in saying that they remain the same in and out\\nof the knowledge situation; and of what objects seem to be, the\\nstatement is obviously false. Just their change in \"knowledge\"\\nconvinces us that they are not \\'real\\' objects with properties\\nchangeable only by new physical relations. But upon this line\\nof argument, there is no reference to objects passing into a\\nknowledge-relation absolutely, but only to those passing from\\none knowledge-relation to another. Knowledge in this case\\nis precisely the recognition and definition of fact as fact. As\\nrespects the meaning-relation then, we are either asking the\\ncontradictory question of whether entering a knowledge-situation\\nalters what we already know objects to be; or else we are\\nindicating that it is through this relation, or its fulfilment—actual\\nor indicated—that things are objects and facts with their\\nunchanged constitution for further knowledge. It is tempting here to raise some side issues. The view that the contrast is\\nbetween one partial meaning-relation and a whole system of such relations\\nleads of course to rationalistic or objective idealism. This view would claim\\nthat in Mr. Woodbridge\\'s argument there is a confusion of \\'being inknowl-edge\\'\\nknowledge\\'—i.e., being in the related system of mutual implications or the perfect\\n\\nall-inclusive judgment—and being present \\'in consciousness,\\' that is in afleet-ing,\\nfleeting, fragmentary apprehension of this total system. It would insist that his\\nargument turns on confusing two senses of \\'knowledge\\': knowledge as ascien-tific,\\nscientific, or logically ordered, system in which alone do \"objects\" exist as objects\\n(or with necessary, or uniform and universal characters) with \\'knowledge\\' as a\\npersonal event—the fragmentary reproduction in finite conditions of the total\\nsystem. It would point out that the possibility of maintaining the reference\\nbeyond itself of \\'consciousness\\' (and hence of escaping \\'subjectivism\\') depends\\nupon precisely the implication in the fragmentary knowing or consciousness of\\nthe total system of judgment as its intent and standard. Compare, for instance,\\nthe doctrine of ^\\'inner and outer meaning\\' in Professor Royce.\\n»3\\n  \\n                            \\nBut why, in any case, should it be supposed that if things gain\\nor lose properties upon entering the meaning-relation, these\\n\\'properties\\' are of the same type as the chemical and\\nphysical properties they present when known? One who accepts\\nneither Professor Woodbridge\\'s logic nor that of idealism might\\ncontend that all knowledge qua knowledge involves reference\\nto \\'things\\' totally outside the knowledge situation as such, and\\nyet hold (and for that very reason) that objects and facts denote\\nthat which satisfies or fulfils the conditions of the knowledge or\\nmeaning situation. It might hold that knowledge transformed\\n\\'existences,\\' but that it transformed them into \\'objects and\\nfacts\\' possessing properties unalterable for any other knowledge\\nsituation, so that, if subsequent alteration is found to be\\nnecessary, that alteration proves that we have not \\'knowledge\\' but\\nerror. Such a theory would protest as much as does Professor\\nWoodbridge against the gain or loss of properties of objects or\\nfacts through the assumption of the knowledge relation.\\nIn no case, if knowledge means meaning-relationships, could\\nthe doctrine that \"things\" are transformed into \"facts or\\nobjects\" by entering it be termed subjectivism, for we are perfectly\\nfamiliar, in the objective region (as in the case of all organic\\nevents), with modification of previous relations by supervention\\nof a new one, and hence with a qualitative change of the\\nelements in the relation.\\n(2) I now propose to examine the situation from the other side.\\nWe now accept and ask for the logical consequences of the\\ndoctrine that an object or fact enters into the knowledge situation in\\nsuch fashion that it is, and hence (by definition) is known to be,\\nin the knowledge situation that which it is outside. We seem at\\nonce to be enmeshed in a net of cross-threads. If an object is\\n  \\n                            \\nalready (i.e., outside of the knowledge situation) completely\\nqualified as fact or object, and if it then enters without any\\nchange into the significance-relation, how is it possible for it to\\nsignify anything? It is, and it would seem as if knowledge were\\njust apprehension, seizure, of what is, not one thing meaning\\nanother thing. But if a thing outside does enter as signifying\\nsomething else beside itself, then it would seem as if it had to be\\ndifferent from the object of knowledge, for the latter is not fixed\\ntill the signifying situation is terminated and is out of the way.\\nFor example, smoke means fire; water means quenching thirst.\\nWhat smoke? First alternative: Why the smoke-of-the-fire, of\\ncourse; just as it is thirst-quenching water which means\\nquenching. But in this case \\'means\\' is a senseless word, \\'is\\' is the only\\nword to be used; we simply have prehension of a fact as it is,\\nwithout any significance-relation. Second alternative: The smoke\\nwhich means fire is not yet determined as smoke-of-the-fire;\\nhence it can be said genuinely to mean it. But in this case, since\\nthe fact, the object is by definition precisely smoke-of-the-fire,\\nthe real object did not enter in its reality the significance relation,\\nbut rather issues—in consciousness—from it. In any case, if\\nknowledge refers to the object which concludes and terminates\\nthe meaning-relation, this relation is not knowledge; while if it\\nrefers to the thing that first presents itself as meaning something,\\nthat thing is transformed. It is of course this logical alternative which leads some to the view that what\\nenters (qua entering) knowledge is only appearance; while reality is what\\nissues (or would issue) with respect to perfect knowledge.\\n»4\\nBefore we consider farther whether (on this view) the change\\nsuffered is merely quantitative, simply a shrinkage of extent, or\\nis qualitative, we have to face the probable reply that while the\\nfact as cosmic fact has undergone change, it has not undergone\\nchange by virtue of entering into the meaning-relation, but by\\nvirtue of coming into relation to the organism, the organism\\nbeing itself a fact of the same order as the fire-smoke fact, and\\nhence capable of being related to it as any one fact is to any other\\nfact. Hence, it may be argued, the fact which actually enters the\\nknowledge situation—the visible, odorous related set of qualities\\ncalled smoke—is precisely the fact as it really is. The argument\\nis plausible; with respect to its import upon the physiological\\n  \\n                            \\nargument for idealism it is, in my judgment, conclusive. But\\nits bearings upon the idealistic notion of consciousness as an\\nexistential stuff, entity or force are not at all the same as its\\nbearings upon the definition of consciousness as significance\\nrelation. What is required by the theory of the entrance of the\\n\"fact\" without change is that the \\'smoke\\' should enter\\n\\'consciousness\\' as smoke-of-fire-having-come-into-relation-with-a-\\npercipient-organism. What the argument has shown is that\\nrelation-to-an-organism is part of the fact; what was required to be\\nshown is that the fact as thus constituted enters unchanged into\\n\\'consciousness.\\' Now the fact as known is not only lacking in\\nthis relation as part of its apprehended content, but the argument\\nassumes that it is lacking—for it attempts an explanation of\\nwhy it is lacking. The more the argument proves that this\\nrelation-to-organism enters into the constitution of the fact, the more\\ndifficulty it has to account for this fact not being what presents\\nitself in \\'consciousness.\\' The fact so constituted appears in\\n\\'consciousness\\' only as the termination and fulfillment of meaning-\\nrelations. We have the same alternatives as before: Either the\\nthing entered as it really was and then the object in which the\\nmeaning-relation terminates is its transformation; or the\\nconclusion presents the real fact and then the real fact was altered in\\nentering the relation.\\nWe come now to the question of the character of the\\ntransformation involved in the assumption of a meaning-relation. Is it\\nquantitative only? If so, it may be argued that a mere\\ndisappearance of some elements leaving others unchanged is not to be\\ntermed, save sophistically, an alteration. This contention seems\\nto me just. But is the change a merely quantitative one? If we\\nknow \\'this\\' to be smoke is there any possibility of a relation of\\nsignificance? Does not the fact of its being smoke already contain\\nas part of itself an apprehended relation to fire? Can the smoke-\\nof-fire be said, intelligibly, to mean fire? If this is already\\ncharacterized as water, is there any possibility of its meaning quenching\\nthirst? Isn\\'t that a property of, or a related element in, water?\\nThe proposition \"water means or implies quenching thirst\"\\nis not to be identified with the judgment that \\'this water will\\nquench thirst\\'—the force of the proposition about water in\\ngeneral is that one meaning implies another meaning; or else it is\\nthat certain attributes actually coexist in the constitution of some\\n  \\n                            \\nobject. In the latter case there is of course no meaning-relation at\\nall; there is a fact apprehended in its constitution as fact. Or in\\nthe first alternative, the proposition \\'this water means quenching\\nthirst\\' contains no meaning-relation, provided \\'this\\' and \\'water\\'\\nare already identical. We have mere tautology so far as statement\\nis concerned; we have just a single prehended fact so far as\\nknowledge is concerned. But if \\'this\\' is not already identified as\\nwater, then the situation must be described as of this sort: this, if\\nit means water, means quenching thirst. The question is as to the\\nmeaning of \\'this\\'; and that question is a genuine question only\\nwhen the character of \\'this\\' is uncertain or indeterminate. The\\n\\'this\\' gains determinate character, Of course, the argument does not require the this to be totally indeterminate\\nin character, but only as respects that in virtue of which it is in the meaning-\\nrelation.\\n»5 moreover, only through the\\nfulfilment of the meaning-relation. If the possibility indicated is\\naccepted and \\'this\\' is drunk, and it quenches thirst, then this is\\nwater. Or else it poisons, and was not water; or else, it does not\\nquench, and the thing meant was not thirst; or else, since it does\\nnot quench thirst, either water or thirst, or both, have a different\\ncharacter from what I took them to have. But upon any of these\\nalternatives the \\'thing\\' meaning and the \\'thing\\' meant are\\nqualitatively different in the meaning-relation—qua in it—from what\\nthey are out of it:—for they are in it only in virtue of their lack of\\ncharacter or determination.\\nI have put the argument, for brevity, categorically. Of course,\\nits force here is purely hypothetical. It is simply a development of\\nthe implications of the propositions that the meaning-relation is\\ngenuine, and that it identifies and defines ^knowledge (instead of\\nknowledge being recognition of the given constitution of fact\\nor object). If the meaning-relation is genuine and genuinely\\nidentifies knowledge, then qualitative transformation is implied\\nin knowledge.\\nFor completeness\\' sake, we refer again to an alternative\\nalready disposed of: \\'This\\' is already (independently of\\nentering the meaning situation) of a problematic and indeterminate\\ncharacter, and its entering the meaning-relation only exposes\\nit for what it already is. Hence there is no alteration. In this\\ncase, however, \\'this\\' is characterized already by the meaning-\\n  \\n                            \\nrelation, for the problematic and indeterminate quality of \\'this\\' is\\nprecisely with respect to a determination of meaning. Knowledge\\nis not accordingly identical with the meaning-relation, but it\\nmerely lights it up as it already exists. In short, if we force\\nProfessor Woodbridge\\'s logic to its conclusion, the conclusion\\nseems to be that the meaning-relation and the constitution of\\nfacts and objects with their spatial and time relations stand on\\nthe same level, and must be served with the same sauce. Either\\nthe meaning-relation is already a part of the fact outside of\\nknowledge, and hence knowledge is not a meaning-relation; or the\\nthing meaning and the thing meant have their quality in the\\nmeaning-relation, and hence are not to be identified, either with\\nthe objects and facts in which the relation finally terminates, or\\nwith \\'things\\' qua not-entering into the knowledge situation.\\nThis concludes the detailed examination. It may however be\\nrejoined that the whole criticism overlooks the primary fact in\\nthe view of Professor Woodbridge. It may be said with reference\\nto my first difficulty that it is precisely the situation itself which is\\neither merely \\'suggestive\\' or of the \\'meaning\\' type; and that only\\nby overlooking this essential portion of the doctrine has the\\ndilemma or supposed antinomy been created. Similarly, it may\\nbe said, that what the situation actually is, is one in which\\nthings constituted-as-the-same-out-of-knowledge-as-in-it mean\\none another; and that it is only the arbitrary assumption that\\nconsciousness changes what enters it that introduces any of the\\ndifficulties that have been urged.\\nThis rejoinder, if made, merely gives another illustration of the\\nfundamental dilemma. The rejoinder means that the situation\\nalready is that sort of a situation apart from \\'consciousness\\'\\nand that knowledge or \\'consciousness\\' is just the awareness\\nof such a situation as already existing; or else it does not mean\\nthis. If it does mean this, then the meaning-relation exists apart\\nfrom knowledge and \\'consciousness,\\' and they are not to be\\ndefined as its equivalents. We surrender the view that knowledge\\nis a meaning-relationship. If it does not mean this, knowledge\\nis a meaning-relationship, then we do not know that the\\nsituation is of the kind indicated; it just is of that kind as a conscious\\nsituation. The situation as such is not knowledge at all, but just\\nan existent empirical—or \\'consciousness\\'—situation. This of\\ncourse is logically fatal to the proposed simplification, for it\\nabandons the statement that \"consciousness\" and knowledge are\\n  \\n                            \\ncoextensive, either denotatively or connotatively. It assumes that\\nknowledge is a peculiar, qualitative relationship in or between\\nthe constituents of a situation, which as a situation is not\\nknowledge at all. Realistically speaking, there is no more reason why\\nthe conscious situation should not be and yet not be known than\\nwhy any other thing should not be without being known. At\\nbottom, it seems to me a survival of idealism to suppose that the\\nexistence of an empirical situation (or if you please of an\\nexperience or of a \\'consciousness\\') is the same as knowledge of that\\nexistence. But, in any case, if for the situation to exist and to be\\nknown is the same thing, we have surrendered the contention\\nthat knowledge is a meaning-relation, for the proposition is not\\nthat the situation means so and so, but that it is so and so. There is, of course, another situation possible to which the proposition that\\nthe situation of this-meaning-smoke-fire itself means so and so properlyap-plies.\\napplies. The situation of smoke-meaning-fire is genuinely known, according to\\nthe definition of knowledge as meaning-relation. This consideration has some\\ninteresting implications, such as (a) Professor Woodbridge\\'s own discussion,\\nor Dr. Bode\\'s, or this paper are illustrations of the possibility noted. That is, it\\nis only from the standpoint of logic that the situation in which S means P can\\nbe said to be known; apart from such reflection, it just exists. (b) Logic, or any\\nbranch of philosophy, since a form of knowledge, is not an endeavor to show\\nwhat knowledge is but what knowledge means. As the only way to have\\nsmoke is to have it, and as the only way to have it when wanted, is to have such\\ncontrol of other things as to be able to produce it, so the only way to realize\\nwhat knowledge is is by knowing—by recourse to the actual empiricalsitua-tion.\\nsituation. But the question of what knowledge—or the meaning-relation—itself\\nmeans is nonetheless an intelligent and, under some circumstances, anim-portant\\nimportant question. The recognition of what knowledge means may help, for\\nexample, to produce the existence of knowledge when wanted; it is clearly\\nnecessary to a discussion of the relation of science to life; it carries with it the\\npossibility of differentiating philosophy from science, etc. (c) The situation in\\nwhich the meaning of knowledge is discussed is not itself, as situation,knowl-edge.\\nknowledge. As situation it just exists, or is \"experience.\" (d) This is the propermean-ing,\\nmeaning, as I understand it, of appeal to \\'experience\\' as final in philosophy and in\\nscience. It indicates the proper sense of the term \\'immediate experience,\\' i.e.,\\nnot a contrast to \\'mediate experience,\\' or thought, but something whichover-lies\\noverlies both mediate experience, that which can be set over against it and the\\ndistinction and relation of the two. At least, this is the only sense in which I\\nhave used the term \\'immediate experience,\\' while critics of that doctrine have\\nalways interpreted it to mean a cognitive distinction; in which sense, it yields\\nabsurdities, naturally and inevitably.\\n»6\\nFinally, I restate my difficulties in a dogmatic way, hoping,\\nhowever, that this summary will be interpreted in the light of\\nwhat precedes, instead of having a ready-made meaning read\\ninto it. Knowledge seems to be employed in a three-fold fashion:\\nFirst, a direct presence, intuition one might say, or prehension of\\n  \\n                            \\nthings as just what they are as prehended; second, something\\ninvolving inference, \\'thought\\' (judgment in the ordinary, non-\\ntechnical, sense of the term), the meaning-relation; the third,\\nthis meaning-relation transcended and completed, an assurance\\nwhich is rational, grounded, an insight which is not merely there\\nbut which can explain and maintain itself when challenged—\\nknowledge as science. The term object has a similar\\n\"triguous\" meaning. In the first sense, it denotes existence irrespective\\nof value or validity; in the second, it denotes data, crude\\nmaterial, as selective determinations of existence for the sake of\\ntheir interpretation or valuation in reference to meaning; in the\\nthird, it denotes valid object, fact which is secure, which satisfies\\nthe conditions of knowledge. These distinctions seem to me\\nboth genuine and significant; fallacy arises only when they are\\nso identified that the description of one is carried over into\\nan account of another. The problems of properly stating their\\ndistinctions from and connections with one another are the\\nproblems of a logical, as distinct from epistemological or\\npsychological theory of knowledge. These problems are genuine,\\nnot factitious. They have been frequently rendered factitious\\nthrough entanglement with irrelevant psychological or\\ncosmological materials. But they stand forth all the more clearly when\\nthese irrelevant trappings are stripped off. Any simplification\\nwhich does not recognize all the factors involved in all the\\nproblems cannot endure, for it will surely call out a reaction by\\nreason of the elements overlooked—and lead probably to an equally\\none-sided insistence upon them, and a consequent swing of\\nthe pendulum in the opposite direction. And a realistic theory\\nwhich itself rests upon the fundamental postulate of\\nidealism—the identification of conscious experience or\\n\\'consciousness\\' with knowledge—offers a peculiar provocative to an\\nidealistic reaction.\\nIn short, the impact of this paper is not particularly upon the\\nspecial theory examined—that of Professor Woodbridge. By\\nits simplicity, conciseness, and thorough-going character, his\\ntheory lends itself to discussion of the ultimate logical issues\\ninvolved. But as compared with other theories of the relation\\nof knowledge to existence, it sins, if it sins at all, only by its\\nclearness and conciseness—by the completeness with which\\nit has rid itself of irrelevant cosmological and psychological\\n  \\n                            \\ntrappings and left the logical issues stripped naked to vision.\\nThe fundamen-\\n[p. 30 missing] versus states of consciousness, it generated\\nepistemology. Meantime the logical question which is fundamental\\npersists; and its fruitful analysis and resolution is hindered by\\ndistraction of attention to ontological and epistemological\\nquestions which would themselves mostly vanish into thin air, if the\\nlogical problem were faced and solved;—or which, if the logical\\nproblem were found to be insoluble, would quietly be laid away\\non the shelf as themselves therefore insoluble.\\nAll the purely psychological presuppositions regarding\\n\\'sentiency\\' and \\'thought\\' can be stripped away from both the\\nsubjective and objective types of idealism; and those theories still\\nhave serious claims, as typical methods of dealing with the\\nlogical problem of the relation of knowledge to existence. The\\nsubjective type is then found to select the alternative noted early in\\nthis paper: the reduction of knowledge to bare copresence or\\nconjunction of existential elements; the objective type is found\\nto select an alternative mentioned later: the assumption that\\n\\'real\\'—as distinct from \\'phenomenal\\'—existence is the content\\nof an absolutely completed system of meaning-relations, and\\nthat reference to this system is intended in every (fragmentary)\\nhuman knowledge. The instrumental or functional theory of\\nknowledge sketched in the Studies in Logical Theory was\\nintended to indicate, through criticism of both of these types\\nof theory, considered as logical types, another type of theory\\nwhich should deal more effectively with the problems at issue.\\nAlmost without exception, the theory has been treated as a\\nrather complicated—probably over-elaborated and hence\\nobscure—method of treating questions which being in themselves\\neither cosmological or psychological or both may be approached\\nbetter more directly. In this paper I have tried to indicate that the\\ndanger under which current \\'realism\\' labors in its logical method\\nis that of denying, by ignoring, certain fundamental logical\\nproblems. In a ^subsequent paper, I hope to come back to the question\\nof idealistic theories of the relation of knowledge and existence,\\nand show that in them also the logical problem is fundamental,\\nand that they also restate, instead of solving, the difficulties they\\nare supposed to deal with.\\n  \\n                            \\nSome Thoughts concerning Religion [Address delivered to the Philosophical Club, Columbia University, New York,\\nN.Y., 17 March 1910. Typescript, not typed by Dewey, in New YorkPhilosophi-cal\\nPhilosophical Club Papers, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Butler Library, Columbia\\nUniversity.]\\n»»\\nNot long ago, Christians justified Christianity on the\\nground of its uniqueness, on the ground of its contrast with other\\nreligions, on the ground that it was true religion and they were\\nreligions falsely so-called. Other religions (save Judaism, which\\nwas regarded as Christianity in preparation or in prophetic types)\\nwere possibly inventions and insinuations of diabolic powers,\\npossibly creations of fallen human nature, and evidences of its\\nlost estate, possibly corrupted reminiscences of an original divine\\nrevelation. But in any case, this contrast with Christianity as the\\none true religion was the characteristic thing about them.\\nThe more enlightened apologists of to-day have changed all\\nthis. We pride ourselves, morally, on having outgrown the\\nintolerance of such a view; intellectually, upon having attained a\\nmore historic and impartial attitude. Christianity is defended\\nto-day on the ground of the universality of religion and on the\\nground that Christianity expresses most adequately the motives\\nand aspirations that dimly and feebly are operative in even the\\nmost superstitious of beliefs and cults. Fetishism, animism, idol-\\nworship, sacrifice and ritual taboo are employed not so much as\\nevidences of false religion in contrast with a true, but rather as\\ntestimonies to the universality of the religious instinct or the\\nreligious need. The dialectic demonstration by ^Hegel of Christianity\\nas \"absolute religion\" paved the way for this mode of conception\\neven among anti-Hegelians; evolutionary and historic methods\\nare supposed to warrant it independently of any philosophic\\ndoctrine.\\n  \\n                            \\nI advert to this situation not for the sake of directly discussing\\nit, but because it suggests to my mind not only a loss of intensity\\non the part of traditional religious convictions, but also loss of a\\ncertain intellectual clarity and simplicity. More explicitly, in\\nlistening to various discussions on religion, both in and out of this\\nclub, I have detected (or at least I have seemed to myself to\\ndetect) a certain confusion between a consideration of religion\\non historic grounds and a consideration on ideal grounds; a\\nconfusion of the de facto and the de jure, an attempt to decide what\\nreligion is and should be for the present and for the coming\\ngeneration on the basis of what has been. I have felt, putting the\\nmatter more technically, some confusion between efforts to set\\nforth the universality of the religious need and attitude in terms\\nof what have passed for religions, and conceptions of universality\\nin the sense of what certain persons regard it as desirable to have\\nbecome more general and more fundamental. It may not be true\\nthat religion is to be defined in terms of the contrast of Christianity\\nwith Paganism, and yet it may be true that it is to be defined—or\\nanticipated—in terms of contrast with historic religions,\\nChristianity included. It may be true that certain phenomena\\n(psychological, social, ethical, or metaphysical) have \"universally\"\\nattended religions in the past, and yet that these \"universalities\"\\nhave little to do with any religious attitude or conviction which\\nwe should wish to become universal. It may be true that religion\\nhas not been universal in any sense, and yet it be true that there is\\na certain quality, disposition, or attitude which it is desirable to\\nhave universal—in the sense of as widespread as possible—an\\nattitude which might properly be called religious. At all events, it\\nis some of the connotations of these suggestions which I wish to\\ndiscuss.\\nII\\nOne point that is characteristic in what for short I may\\ncall the developmental definition of religion is the insistence\\nupon the gradual evolution to the point of explicitness of the\\nethical factor:—traits that had a physical or magical meaning\\nin the lower religions have taken on moral signification in the\\nhigher and later, so that we must suppose this factor will become\\n  \\n                            \\ndominant in the future. Well, is this an evolution, or is it a\\nrevolution? Is this change one that emphasizes or that ignores\\ngenuine historic continuity? Is there any conceivable dissolution\\nof continuity more radical than a change from non-moral to\\nmoral as a defining trait? Now can we describe or define religion\\nby means of the common denominator method if we admit\\nthis transition from the non-moral to the moral? I confess the\\nattempt to conceive the proper universality of religion on the basis\\nof a survey of historic religious phenomena which at the same\\ntime emphasizes the historic evolution as one from the non-\\nethical to the ethical seems to me self-stultifying. I recall with\\ninterest the ardor with which in one discussion that I heard, the\\nhistorians scouted the idea that religion had anything to do with\\nmorals. There was nothing, they declared with emphasis, with\\nwhich the religions that had come under their observation had\\nless to do with than morals! As I listened I was perplexed, for it\\nseemed to me they were correct, and it also seemed to me that\\nthose who pointed out the constantly increasing explicitness of\\nthe moral factor in religions were also correct. The only way\\nout of this confusion which I have found is to admit frankly that\\nwe are not dealing here with lower and higher \"stages\" of the\\nsame phenomenon, and that we must frankly make our choice\\nbetween two criteria. We must either take the traits characteristic\\nof the non-ethical religious phenomena as furnishing the\\nmaterials out of which to construct our conception; or we must cut\\nloose, and say that we decide (however arbitrarily) that nothing\\nis worthy to be called religion save a somewhat profound\\nqualification of our moral attitude, so that it is only by a somewhat\\ndoubtful courtesy of language that the greater part of historic\\n\"religions\" and that which we now propound as the \"religion\"\\nof to-day and to-morrow can both be called religions.\\nIII\\nIt is perhaps pertinent to note that those who attempt to\\njustify the religious attitude by its universality in the past do\\nnot agree either as to the criterion for this universality or as\\nto the characteristic structures and forms in which it is found\\nexpressed. Some seek it by the psychological road. Of those who\\n  \\n                            \\nseek it by this path, some find its exhibition in a special\\n\"instinct\" that drives out upon the unknown or the infinite, or upon\\nthe vaguely felt welfare of the race as against that of the individual.\\nOthers with the same general type of criterion, emphasize\\ncertain emotions, wavering between that of fear running into awe\\nand reverence, and that of communion and kinship, or some\\njuxtaposition of the two emotions. Others emphasize the sense\\nof luck, of chance, of fortune, amid the uncertain vicissitude of\\nlife. Others again look not to a universal instinct or emotional\\nreaction, but to some universal need.\\nThere are others (not so numerous perhaps, but nevertheless\\nothers) who hold that any attempt to find universality by any\\npsychological road is doomed to self-stultification—the universal\\nmust be objective, and objectively necessary. They look for\\nuniversality upon the side of a relationship, quite independent of\\nany instinct or emotion (though possibly having its own specific\\nemotional accompaniment) that necessarily exists between man\\nand the universe. Some would hold (any realist would be bound\\nto hold) that this universal relation might exist and yet many\\nindividuals be unconscious of it, so that the universality of\\nreligion would be compatible with many individuals being non-\\nreligious,—and even, possibly, being none the worse on that\\naccount. This relation may be variously conceived; as that of the\\nfinite to the infinite, as that of intelligence to a world which\\ncannot be rationalized, as that of necessary ignorance and\\nconsequent faith, to a world which even though itself intelligent can\\nnever be mastered by our intelligence. I have no mind to use these\\ndiversities between and among the psychological and the\\nmetaphysical criteria of universality as proof of the futility of the\\nsearch for any existential universal. I am willing to admit the\\npossibility of some reconciliation of them; or that the progress of\\nknowledge will dispel erroneous attempts and substantiate the\\ntruth of some one method. I think, however, these diversities are\\nevidence of the difficulty of the situation, and that they require\\ngreater attention than they have received. I wish especially to call\\nattention to the difficulty of reconciling any one of the\\nconceptions with historical facts on one side and with the justification\\nof religion as a present and future fact on the other side. If\\nwe start with the concept of awe and adoration, it is perhaps\\npossible to adjust the wholesale human sacrifices of say the\\n  \\n                            \\nPeruvians to this notion. If we start with those of kinship and\\ncommunion, we may bring the organized temple prostitution\\nand the licensed promiscuous intercourse of some Asiatic cults\\nunder the rubric. But just where are we as to the import of any\\nreligion that we at present wish to recommend and justify? Again\\nmany (seemingly a growing number) of historic scholars are\\ninclined to take the view that historically magic is a much more\\nwidespread and significant trait of religion than has been\\nhitherto recognized. The belief that there is diffused in all things a\\nsort of wonderful energy—a kind of electric charge as it were—\\nwhich has both a baneful and a beneficial effect on human\\ndestiny, with which certain individuals may by certain practices get\\nin to sympathetic relations so as to control it for personal or\\nsocial ends—this belief is thought by some scholars to be the\\nroot fact of all so-called natural religions. That this belief may\\nhave some points of contact with both the psychological and the\\nmetaphysical definition of religion is obvious. It may even be\\nregarded as symbolically prophetic of a profoundly ethical fact—\\nthe practices in question may turn out to be certain attitudes and\\npassions of the soul, and the advantages to be attained may turn\\nout certain profound moral ameliorations. But again I do not see\\nhow the universality and presumptive validity of religions is\\nfurthered by assimilating the magical and the ethical types of\\nrelationship to each other. We may take one type or the other\\nas the measure of our conception of religion. Can we possibly\\ntake both?\\nIt is indeed an interesting problem to determine the\\npsychological and the social phenomena that have characterized or\\ndetermined historical religions. To discover the types of emotional\\nattitudes that various historic religions have appealed to and\\nnourished is a legitimate field. It is conceivable that future study\\nwill justify a reduction of accompanying psychological\\nphenomena to one or two fundamental themes upon which seeming\\ndiversities are merely variations—though it seems more likely\\nthat farther study will reveal a greater diversity of psychological\\nmotive and reaction than we have as yet supposed to exist. But\\neven with successful reduction and simplification, is it to be\\nsupposed that any more light is thrown upon the proper nature\\nand validity of religion than is thrown upon the science of today\\nand tomorrow by a study of its forerunners in alchemy and\\nastrology?\\n  \\n                            \\nIV\\nI must, of course, pay my respects to evolution and the\\ncontinuity of history. As my readers are doubtless already acutely\\naware, I am denying the necessity of conceiving and defining\\npresent religion in terms of its evolution out of past religions, and\\nam upholding the futility of such a method of claiming validity\\nfor religion. But to deny that any possible future religion can be,\\nstrictly speaking, an evolution from past religions is not to deny\\nthat future religion will be an evolution. There are other things\\nthan prior religions, we may remind ourselves, out of which a\\nfuture religion may evolve. We are not limited to supposing that\\na proper religion is an emancipation of some religious factor\\nwhich has been all the time latent, in past cults and creeds,\\nalthough loaded down with all kinds of extraneous and harmful\\naccretions. The root of the religious attitude of the future may lie\\nimmensely more in an improved state of science and of politics\\nthan in what have been termed religions. Doubtless there are\\ncertain constants, roughly speaking, in human nature. Doubtless\\nthese constants in their interaction with the natural and social\\nenvironments have naturally produced, among other things,\\nreligions. But it would seem as if the \"universal\" was to be sought in\\nthese interactions rather than in any one isolated strain,\\npsychological or metaphysical. If so, the democracy and the science, the\\nart of to-day may be immensely more prophetic of the religion\\nwhich we would have spread in the future than any phenomena\\nwe seek to isolate under the caption of religious phenomena.\\nObviously what I have said is not a confession of religious\\nfaith. But it may properly be added that it is not necessarily a\\nconfession of irreligion. About as universal a fact as there is, is\\nthe fact of individuality itself. It is noteworthy that up to the\\npresent toleration has been a negative rather than a positive idea.\\nWe have learned to put up with what seem to us erroneous\\ndivergencies and eccentricities of belief (even when we conceive them\\nmore or less harmful) partly because we want others to bear with\\nour own idiosyncracies, and partly because we have learned that\\nthe method of intolerance does not pay, socially. Practically, in\\nmatters of religious belief, these attitudes have carried us a very\\nlong way. But we have hardly adjusted our emotions and ideas to\\nthe practical change. More has been said about the sacredness\\nof individual belief than has been deeply affirmed. If I were\\n  \\n                            \\nmaking a more positive search for something universal to be\\ncalled religious, I should be inclined to look towards the\\nuncoerced and untutored attitude of the individual as his natural\\ninstincts and his matured experience coalesce in a certain serious\\ntemper regarding the things of life. If religion is not more\\nuniversal or widespread than it is, I am inclined to believe that to a\\nconsiderable extent this is due to the age-long tendency of some\\npeople to tell other people what religion is or ought to be.\\nExternally Protestantism seems to be a historic episode of revolt;\\nperhaps its deeper and more permanent meaning is carried in the\\nsuggested intrinsic individualism.\\nV\\nIt may facilitate discussion if I sum up in certain\\nquestions, though of course I have no wish to limit discussion by\\nformulating these questions.\\n1. Does the search for and discovery of a common factor\\n(whether psychological or objective) in past religious\\nphenomena establish\\n(a) a presumption in favor of the religious attitude? If so, how?\\n(b) Does it shed definite light upon the nature of what persons\\nto-day should be encouraged to cherish as religion? If so, how?\\n2. If we abandon this sort of method for conceiving and\\njustifying religion, what other method remains?\\n  \\n                            \\nTolstoi\\'s Art [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 60, folder 29, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1910-11.]\\n»»\\nLiterary art of the dramatic sort—and Tolstoi\\'s art is\\nvividly dramatic—and philosophy have a common point of\\ndeparture, even though they go such different ways that their\\ngoals are at the antipodes. They both begin in a sense of the\\ncontradictions of life: conflicts between its purposes and the\\nconditions of existence under which these purposes must be achieved.\\nThe first element in the equipment of a dramatist is a keen and\\ndirect perception of the ironies of men\\'s aims and endeavors. If\\nthe dramatist later turns philosopher, if that is he begins to reflect\\nupon the contradictions that observation has revealed, and tries\\nto find some theoretic solution,—solution by universal principle\\ninstead of in the movement of a particular situation to its natural\\ndestiny—he has at least one great advantage. Having first seen\\nthe problem in the concrete, in the entanglements of human\\nbeings in perplexities that vitally concern them, his method and\\nhis conclusion within the sphere of abstract reflection are likely\\nto retain a reality and a force of appeal that do not belong to\\ntheories that begin as well as end with generalities.\\nTolstoi\\'s method, even in his most abstract treatises—and he\\nhas written a number of abstract treatises, like \"Life\" and \"Power\\nand Liberty\"—is that of the dramatic artist. He did not start out\\nfrom general principles or from purely intellectual difficulties.\\nSome actual and individualized happening, involving the\\nsuffering and joy of some actual human being, struck him, impressing\\nhim so deeply that it stayed by him, and tortured him till he\\ndiscovered a general reason for a whole class of failures and\\nperplexities.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe whole of Tolstoi\\'s philosophy of government, of crime and\\nthe further crime of its violent punishment, starts, for example,\\nwith a vivid and unforgettable scene, observed almost by\\naccident, a guillotining in Paris. \"I gasped and realized in every fiber\\nof my being that all the arguments which I had hitherto heard\\nupon capital punishment were wickedly false; . . . and there was\\nI, by my silence and my non-interference, an aider, an abetter\\nand a participator in the sin.\" Again his whole philosophy of\\nsociety upon its industrial side, had an equally concrete and\\npersonal origin. He went to visit the slums, being uneasy in\\nhis wealth and idle luxury and moved to do something to relieve\\nmisery. But when he got to the slums, the eye and emotion\\nof the artist showed him that the problem was concrete, not\\nabstract. He really, not merely conventionally, saw the individual\\nhuman beings: \"the scolding old women, the light-hearted old\\nmen, and the sliding boys. . . . I now realized for the first time in\\nmy life . . . that they must somehow fill up the rest of the twenty-\\nfour hours of every day, a whole life of which I had never even\\ndreamed before. I realized now . . . that these people beside\\nthe mere need of food and shelter must live through the rest of\\nevery day of their lives just as other people have to do; must get\\nangry and be dull while appearing to be light-hearted or be sad\\nor merry. And now for the first time I was aware that it was not a\\nmatter of feeding a thousand beings like a thousand sheep, but\\nthat each of the thousand was just such another man as myself.\"\\nCertain situations haunted Tolstoi as anomalies, as\\ncontradictions, as gratuitously unnecessary. If one is not content to accept\\nthem as regrettable indeed, but nevertheless inevitable, one must\\nbe led to try to account for them. And Tolstoi\\'s speedy\\nconclusion was that while certain sufferings are inevitable, the really\\nserious evils do not flow from anything in the nature of things or\\nin the nature of life; they are all due to false conceptions of the\\nmeaning of life, to false philosophies in short. And so he was\\nnaturally led to a search for the true conception of life which if\\ngenerally entertained would put an end to these miseries that\\ncontradict the meaning of life; and also to describing the various\\nkinds of false philosophies whose prevalence is responsible for\\nthe evils of the existing situation; or which just formulate and\\njustify, and thereby continue it. I mention first some of the false\\ntheories. One is the belief that the evils are inevitable, because\\n  \\n                            \\ndue to the free will of man, the doctrine of free will being an\\ninvention according to Tolstoi of theologians and experts in\\ncriminal law. But man\\'s freedom is not found in the relation of\\nhis will to his acts, but in the relation of his reason to the\\nmeaning of his acts. Activity, the actual doing of things, proceeds from\\nthe energy of the universe itself not from will in its fancied\\nisolation. Man is free either to recognize or not recognize the law\\nof this energy, the direction in which it is proceeding, the end\\ntoward which it is making. Man is truly free and hence happy\\nonly when he recognizes this law and identifies himself with it,\\nmakes the law of the universe his own law. Man, he says, is like a\\nhorse drawing a wagon which is itself drawn by others. Go on he\\nmust in any case; he is not free to stop nor to draw the wagon at\\nhis own caprice. But he can either draw freely, or unwillingly and\\nthen be pushed on; that is to say, he may recognize the end of the\\nactivity as his own end, and so be in an attitude of peace and joy\\nin the performance of his tasks, or he may isolate his\\nconsciousness, his own wish and purpose and so be in a state of\\nopposition, of struggle condemned in advance to failure, and hence to\\ndiscontent and misery.\\nAlmost everybody has got disgusted with the futility of the\\ndiscussion of free will, and hence I am afraid that my brief\\nstatement of Tolstoi\\'s attitude will suffer from that polite indifference\\nwith which all references to the matter have come to be received.\\nBut in the case of Tolstoi, the underlying idea, whether we call\\nit free will and necessity or call it something else, is absolutely\\nessential to the understanding of his philosophy of life in general\\nand of his attitude towards special attempts at economic and\\npolitical reform in particular. The latter point is simpler, even if\\nsecondary, and so may be mentioned first. In a letter addressed to\\nthe Liberals with reference to their agitation for a representative\\nform of government in Russia, he said, \"True, the rights, the\\npowers of a member of Parliament are greater than those of a\\nplain man, and it seems accordingly as if much could be\\naccomplished by using these rights. But the hitch is that in order to\\nobtain these greater rights one has to abandon part of one\\'s\\nrights as a man.\" Other passages of his writings make it clearer\\nwhat he means, and that it is not a part but the essence of man as\\nman that is abandoned. After describing the mass of evils that\\nexist in the world, he says, \"What can I do against all this ocean?\\n  \\n                            \\nWhy should I express my opinion? Why should I even have one?\\nSo leaving the most powerful of all the weapons—thought and\\nits expression—that move the world, almost everybody resorts\\nto the weapon of social activity, not observing that every social\\nactivity is based on the very foundations against which one must\\nfight, so that in entering upon the resort to methods of social\\nreform, one has first of all to make some concession, to deviate\\nfrom the truth. . . . There is but one adequate weapon in our\\npossession, the consciousness and expression of truth, and that\\nwe refuse to use.\" In other words, there is literally but one thing\\nneedful; the change in the attitude of consciousness, of thought,\\nthe turning away from a false notion of the object and law of\\nlife to a true one; till this radical or moral revolution has been\\neffected, every practical and overt step at reform, economic or\\npolitical, is infected with the principle of evil, and hence is bound\\nto turn out badly. On the other hand, given the adequate\\nrecognition of the nature of life, and all other things will follow as\\nmatter of course in due season. All or nothing, is Tolstoi\\'s\\nphilosophy, and upon the truth or falsity of this division rests the truth\\nor falsity of Tolstoi\\'s philosophy. And \"All\" means the willing\\nadoption of the law and aim of life as presented by reason or\\nthought as the law and aim of individual existence; \"Nothing\"\\nmeans the self-contradiction, the predestined failure and hence\\nmisery of everything short of this.\\nJust what, then, is this universal law and aim? Every one\\nwould recognize I suppose that action is not free in the building\\nof a house, and that failure and unhappiness result in the degree\\nin which activity proceeds on the basis that it is free. Except in\\nthe degree in which the end is necessary, in which a house is\\nreally needed, and except in the degree in which one willingly\\nobserves the necessary laws of nature in the building of the\\nhouse, the work is a relative failure. Now the first principle of\\nTolstoi\\'s philosophy is that life as a whole, both as respects the\\nnecessity of its end and as respects the necessity of the means of\\naccomplishing this end, comes under exactly the same necessary\\nlaws, laws which man cannot change or deceive, any more than\\nin the case of building the house. The difference—and this is\\nthe source of the unhappiness and contradictions of life—is\\nthat everybody practically recognizes that the successful\\nbuilding of a house is dependent upon the recognition of natural\\n  \\n                            \\nlaws and conditions, and that this recognition depends upon\\nour consciousness, our thought, having first studied out these\\nlaws, while practically nobody recognizes that there are laws as\\nfixed in themselves whose discovery and acknowledgment is our\\nprimary ^business in the case of building of the house of life.\\nWith respect to the meaning of life, that is, the attainment\\nof good or happiness, man still acts under the guidance of an\\nillusory consciousness, which because it is illusory inevitably\\nleads him astray—that is, to misery. The essence of this false\\ntheory is that life, or existence, is an individual thing, with an\\nindividual aim: that the self which the senses reveal and which\\nmanifests itself through the bodily appetites, a self which as\\nthus expressed, is separate, is real. This is isolation of self as the\\nroot of belief in free will and is the illusory consciousness, from\\nwhich all the evils of life proceed. (This, of course, is the point of\\ngreatest contact between Tolstoi and oriental thought, especially\\nBuddhistic.) (This way of conceiving life is itself the basic\\nphilosophy and what we call, conventionally, philosophies are only\\nmore elaborate formulations and attempts at justification of this\\noriginal philosophy.) Elaborations of the primitive illusion\\nconstitute philosophies and theologies, and fall, roughly speaking,\\ninto two groups, which Tolstoi picturesquely calls that of the\\n^Pharisees and that of the Scribes. The former is the theory of life\\nwhich has universally become the creed of ecclesiastical\\norganizations. Its essence is that this life and this world are inherently\\nevil, or at least so evil that man has no right to expect happiness\\nhere; this life being something to be suffered as a painful\\ndiscipline for the sake of the enduring happiness of a life still to come.\\nThis doctrine means then that the ultimate moral principles\\n(which are also as we have seen the sole ultimate metaphysical\\nprinciples) do not really apply here and now. It also means that\\nthe underlying philosophy is self-centered; it is the personal life,\\nthe personal existence which is to be eternally perpetuated as the\\ncondition and residence of true happiness. It would be\\nimpossible to say which of these two conceptions Tolstoi finds more\\nfalse. The doctrine that the law of life is not really the law of life\\nas it actually is here and now, that the discovery of this law is a\\nmatter of \"faith\" or the acceptance of a doctrine or dogma and\\nthus totally beyond the scope of reason—instead of the essence\\nof reason being the search for and discovery of this law—is the\\n  \\n                            \\nreason that men in general make no systematic attempt to live\\nhere and now according to the teachings of Buddha, Confucius,\\nSocrates, Jesus and Epictetus and others who have used their\\nreason to discern the true law of life, and also accept the\\nmiseries of our present economic and political order as necessary,\\nor even as having a positive value in leading men to place their\\nthoughts upon a next life. Upon the other hand, the emphasis\\nupon a life after death, the doctrine of resuscitation as Tolstoi\\ncontemptuously calls it, is proof that the professed\\nrepresentatives of the true philosophers have absolutely perverted the\\nteachings of their professed masters, reverting to the illusory\\nconsciousness that happiness or the good is something connected\\nwith a separate, individual self.\\nBy the doctrines of the Scribes, Tolstoi means all the modern\\nphilosophies of all schools, which have reacted against the\\nsupernatural philosophy of life but have attempted to find a substitute\\nin an examination of the world, physically considered, as it is\\nmade known in the natural sciences, or else logically\\nintellectually considered. We may perhaps without doing violence to\\nTolstoi\\'s thought cite Spencer and Comte as types of the first,\\nHegel as a representative of the second. It is not easy to state\\nbriefly and accurately the attitude of Tolstoi toward science,\\nthough it is simple and in some respects identical as he himself\\nrecognizes, with that of Plato. Its very simplicity gets in the way\\nof our understanding it. It is that primary science consists of\\nknowing the laws ^in terms of its end or object, and then\\nproceeding to study things on the basis of their relation to the final\\nobject. But if one does not first know the object, intellect is\\ntotally without a guide in all its other studies. And this is just the\\nfallacy of all scientific philosophies so called. As a result what\\nnow passes for science is either an attempt to justify the existing\\norder of life—as the social sciences—or a collection of trivialities\\nwithout reference to the guidance of life and the happiness of the\\nmasses—the physical sciences. Tolstoi makes use of the\\n^metaphor of a miller and his mill for grinding grain. For a while this\\nmiller fixes his attention on the product, on the quality of the\\nflour that issues; with respect to this he watches, adjusts and\\nrepairs all the parts of his mill. His knowing has an object and\\nconsequently his knowledge is ordered. But after a while he gets\\ninterested in the mechanism of grinding; he forgets the object,\\n  \\n                            \\nthe product, entirely. He is thus brought to the conclusion that\\nthe secret of the mill is in the dam and the river. And finally so\\ninfatuated is he with the discovery that the river is the source of\\nhis power that he proclaims that the river is the mill. Meantime\\nthe mill as the source of flour is neglected. In this parable Tolstoi\\nconveys his two main ideas. It is a primary principle of Tolstoi—\\nwhich he applies to history as well as to nature—that the facts—\\nthe things which may be studied—are literally infinite,\\ninnumerable. Hence they of themselves give no clue either to what\\nshould be selected for study—and selection there must be—or\\nof the order of their arrangement or importance. Hence there\\nfinally arises the exact inversion of the true order; the miller says\\nthe river is the mill, the \"scientific philosopher\" says life is an\\narrangement of purely physical energies. And since he too must\\ngo by what is physical and sensible, he too succumbs to the\\nillusion that life is something separate and isolated. The other\\nabsurdity of scientific philosophy is that it takes what is remote,\\nwhat is less sure, and substitutes it for what is truly certain and\\nthe closest to us of all things. A part of Tolstoi\\'s ironic vision is\\nthat he sees scientific inquiries hastening away from what is most\\nsure, what is absolutely certain, to what is very remote, to what\\nis purely abstract and hypothetical, and then calling the latter\\nscience—genuine, rational certainty. The thing that is\\nindubitably certain about life is that it is a struggle away from suffering,\\nfrom evil, and towards joy, towards good, happiness. But fears\\nand hates, hopes and loves, joys and miseries—this is just the\\nthing that scientists and philosophers both leave out of account.\\nAnd in leaving it out of account, they not only deprive their\\nintellectual inquiries of all point and order, but they also ignore the\\nmost certain of all things in behalf of what is remote and\\ninferential. \"However much one may assure and instruct a man that all\\nreal existence is an idea, that matter is made up of atoms, that\\nthe essence of life is will or physical energy, etc., one cannot\\nthereby explain to a being with pains, pleasures, hopes, fears, his\\nposition in the world.\"\\nThe essence of true philosophy is then simply the recognition\\nof the testimony of rational consciousness regarding the\\nhappiness of man and the conditions of its attainment; and this is\\nsimply the repudiation of the illusory, or sense consciousness of\\nseparate or individual existence: the recognition once for all that\\n  \\n                            \\nhappiness resides in identification of individual aim and effort\\nwith that of all living beings. For the positive demonstration of\\nthis truth, Tolstoi appeals in part to the teachings of the great\\nteachers of the race, but more especially to the sincere, the honest\\nconviction of every man in the moments when he is honest with\\nhimself. \"At bottom,\" he virtually says, \"you already know all\\nthis as well as I if you have thought upon life at all; you know\\nalso all the ingenious and insincere devices you have for\\nconcealing from yourself your own acknowledgement of this truth; you\\nknow that you spend a large part of your time in activities whose\\nunderlying motive is but to distract yourself from your\\nrecognition of this truth and the responsibilities to which it engages you.\\nBut the crowning absurdity is that while your wish as the wish of\\nevery man is to be happy, you decline to take the one simple way\\nwhich you already know is the only way in which you can find\\nhappiness.\" Thus it is that Tolstoi\\'s demonstration of his main\\nthesis, if we may call it such, is negative; it consists once more in\\npointing out in vivid and cumulative detail all the miseries that\\ncome to men here and now in their search for happiness as long\\nas they take happiness to be something connected with their own\\npersonal existence and consciousness of this existence, instead of\\nproceeding from the renunciation of all such private and severed\\nexistence. These ironies of search for individual happiness in a\\nlife every step of which is a step towards its own annihilation, or\\ndeath; this search for happiness of an exclusive ego every act\\nof which brings defeat because it involves conflict with others\\nwho are just as much exclusive egos bent on their own\\nexclusive happiness as we; of search for happiness in getting power\\nand possessions every item of which is a challenge to others\\nto get them away from us into their own control and every\\nitem of which takes us a little further way from the natural and\\nhealthy sources of enjoying life—^these ironies of a self-centered\\nlife which Tolstoi first portrayed dramatically in his fiction, he\\nafterwards proclaims as a preacher and a prophet. There is no\\nsuch break between his literary, or artistic career and his moral\\nas is often represented. In his later life he but makes articulate the\\nmoral of all his earlier literary work. As I said at the outset his\\ntheories are but the generalized statements of his own vivid\\nperceptions of life as it dramatically goes on.\\n  \\n                            \\nIn conclusion, I would point out that while Tolstoi is\\nfundamentally a mystic and an ascetic—or teacher of renunciation—\\nhe differs very radically from most of those with whom we are\\nfamiliar as mystics and ascetics. He differs from most mystics in\\nhis absolute conviction that the road to the final good—the\\nlosing of one\\'s separate personality in the life of all—is to be\\nattained by reason and is to be exemplified in a life of concrete\\nrelations to nature and to other people. He differs from the\\nascetic in his absolute conviction that happiness is the only\\ngood and end of life and that renunciation is simply the logical\\ncondition of attaining true happiness, being indeed only the\\nrenunciation of the self-contradictory ways of trying to be happy.\\nIt would be impossible to exaggerate his reliance upon reason\\nand rational knowledge, and his contempt for faith in the\\nconventional sense of that term. Of the doctrine that the teaching of\\nJesus has reference to a future life instead of to the conditions of\\ngetting happiness here he says: \"It is a doctrine that the only true\\nlife is only in faith, that is in imagination, that is in lunacy. . . .\\nOnly a conviction that reality does not exist and the nonexistent\\nis alone real could lead to the surprising contradiction that the\\ndoctrine of Jesus is true but is not the rational principle of this\\nlife.\" At times he even goes so far as to say that the chief real\\npurpose of individual endeavor is to improve reason so that\\nit may apprehend the meaning of life in all its details more\\naccurately and fully. \"We are accustomed,\" he says, \"to\\nconsider moral doctrine as an insipid and monotonous affair, in\\nwhich there can be nothing new. In reality human life with all\\nits complicated and varied actions—even those that seem to\\nhave nothing to do with morals, political activity, endeavor in\\nthe sciences, the arts, commerce—has no other object than to\\nelucidate moral truths more and more, and to confirm, simplify\\nand make them more accessible to all. I recollect once while\\nwalking a street in Moscow I saw a man come out and examine\\nthe flagstones attentively; then choosing one of them he sat down\\nby it and began to rub and scrape it vigorously. \\'What is he doing\\nwith the pavement?\\' I wondered. Coming close I discovered that\\nhe was a butcher\\'s boy and was sharpening his knife on the\\nstones. He was not thinking concerning the stones even when\\nexamining them; he was merely sharpening his knife in order\\n  \\n                            \\nthat he might cut meat; to me it had seemed that he was doing\\nsomething to the pavement. In the same way, mankind seems to\\nbe occupied with commerce, treaties, wars, sciences, arts; and\\nyet only one thing is important for them and they do only that—\\nthey are elucidating the moral laws by which they live.\"\\nWe usually associate the doctrine that this life is evil with the\\ndoctrine of complete renunciation, with the Buddhistic theory of\\nillusion and Nirvana and so on. There are many striking\\nlikenesses, as well as equally marked differences between Tolstoi\\nand Rousseau. Among the likenesses is an extraordinary\\nsensitiveness to the feelings, the joys and sufferings of all sentient\\ncreatures. If in some sense Rousseau is the discoverer of\\ndemocracy as a social idea, not merely as a governmental arrangement,\\nit is because Rousseau had such a vivid perception that whatever\\nthe differences of men in social rank, political power and in\\nculture, they are alike in their power to feel, in their sensitiveness\\nto misery and happiness, and that by the side of this fundamental\\nlikeness all differences are trivial and superficial. Capacity for\\nsympathy with the pain and pleasure of others is, fortunately,\\namong the commonest of human endowments; capacity for\\nabstract reflection is not infrequent; but capacity to reflect widely\\nand deeply on the basis of and in terms of this sympathetic\\nsensitiveness to the weal and woe of others is perhaps the rarest of\\ngifts: so rare that its occurrence is as good a definition of genius\\nas any we are likely to find. And this gift, Tolstoi, like Rousseau,\\nhad in extraordinary measure. Through this sensitiveness he was\\nsaved, even in his most extreme reactions against society as it is\\nand life as it is usually lived, from the abstractions or aberrations\\nof most moralists—making duty or a good character by itself,\\ninstead of actual concrete good, or happiness, an end in itself.\\nI have said nothing directly regarding my announced subject:\\nthe connection of Tolstoi with the thought of his time. From one\\npoint of view, there is no more to say under this caption than fell,\\nin the history of Ireland, within the famous chapter on snakes.\\nTolstoi is, at every turn, an opponent of what is most\\ncharacteristic in contemporary thought. Yet without artificial forcing there\\nare very genuine connections. They are not, however, in the\\nsolutions proffered but in the apprehension of problems. It is not too\\nmuch to say that all the significant philosophy of the latter half of\\n  \\n                            \\nthe nineteenth century is preoccupied with essentially the\\nproblems which Tolstoi felt so keenly. The first and fundamental is\\nthe relation of theory and practice, of knowledge and conduct.\\nAnd as respects this point Tolstoi, like so many other practical\\nmoralists, anticipated the teachings of one of the popular\\nphilosophic isms of the day. He teaches that man knows, in the full\\nand intimate sense of knowledge, only what he does; that belief\\nin principles that are not carried into behavior is incomplete\\nand insincere. He teaches also, in common with this ism, that\\npractical purposes and ends furnish the motive of all knowledge,\\nand the only ground for selection and arrangement of facts\\ninquired into.\\nFor at least a hundred years professed philosophy has been\\nincreasingly perplexed with two great questions: How are the\\nresults and methods of modern science, bound up with a purely\\nmechanical view of the world, compatible with man\\'s moral\\ninterests, that proclaim the supremacy of purpose and thought?\\nAnd how is the increasing preoccupation of man with the things\\nof the material world, the multiplication and cheapening of\\ncommodities that relate to the senses and to the appetites, related\\nto man\\'s ideal interests, what somewhat indefinitely we call\\nhis \"spiritual interests\"? Even from the side of abstract and\\ntechnical philosophy there are two seeming contradictions or\\nantinomies: Man\\'s increasing intellectual command over nature—in\\nhis science—seems to reveal mankind absolutely caught and\\nhelpless within a vast unrelenting mechanism which goes its way\\nwithout reference to human value or care for human purpose;\\nMan\\'s command over the means of life, his industrial conquest,\\nseems only to have sharpened prior existing social inequities, to\\nhave led to devotion to the means of life at the expense of its\\nserious and significant ends—a noble, free and happy life in\\nwhich all men participate on something like equal terms. Now\\nthe relation of Tolstoi to modern thought may fairly be said to be\\nthat he puts modern thought up against these problems with\\nabsolute severity, as problems that are not merely intellectual\\nand technical—problems of a class of men labelled thinkers—\\nbut problems with whose right solution the welfare of man,\\nindividual and social, is absolutely bound up. I do not imagine that\\nhis own solutions will satisfy many: they are too much on the\\n  \\n                            \\nAll or Nothing basis; they make too absolute a separation\\nbetween sense and reason, between the physical and the moral,\\nbetween the individual self and humanity. But the intensity, the\\nsincerity with which Tolstoi proclaimed and lived the reality of\\nthe problems make him a figure that the thought of today must\\nabsolutely reckon with.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe Meaning and Progress of Morality [Address delivered at Mount Morris Baptist Church, New York, N.Y., 17\\nDecember 1911. Stenographic report in Dewey VFM 88, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.]\\n»»\\nConsidering the topic of the morning, I am afraid that\\nmy first statement may be a disappointing one, namely, that in\\nthe strict sense of the term, there has been no evolution of\\nmorality. I do not mean by this that moral practices and beliefs have\\nstood still, or that, in the words of the older school, \"Morality is\\neternal and immutable\"; I mean rather that there have been so\\nmany varying lines of development in moral belief and practices,\\nthat it is not easy for us with our present knowledge, in fact, it is\\nnot possible to pick out or to identify any one single, steady,\\nconsecutive line of evolution in morals; that is, we cannot find any\\none unified, consecutive trend of events, such as we find in the\\nplant world or in the animal world, or even in the development\\nof our solar system. Now the reason I think is quite obvious\\nupon reflection. Our moral life is an exceedingly complex thing\\nand it is influenced by a great many different independent forces.\\nIt is what the mathematician might call the function of a great\\nnumber of independent, variable moral practices. Mankind, for\\nexample, has always been influenced by political organization.\\nThe kind of social organization that has existed at a certain time,\\nhas reflected itself in the morals of a clan, of a despotic empire, of\\na city, state and of a large democracy, is always different, because\\nthe social conditions, the political demands and regulations are\\ndifferent. Again, of course, legal procedure has had a very great\\ninfluence upon morals, because one of the businesses of the law\\nhas been to define what men could do and what they could not\\ndo, to make a list, a schedule of offenses and of the penalties for\\noffenses. Now while legality and morality are never the same\\n  \\n                            \\nthing, history shows that men\\'s moral conceptions have always\\nbeen influenced and have sometimes been modeled after their\\nlegal ideas and practices in industry, trade, commerce.\\nThe industrial, economic life of men is another thing that has\\nprofoundly influenced their moral conceptions, as certain\\nvirtues, like thrift, industry and prudence, have been almost a direct\\nproduct of certain conditions of industrial life. Perseverance and\\npatience, as virtues, have always thrived among people where the\\nindustrial element—agricultural, especially—was very strong.\\nIt is obvious that men\\'s moral ideas have been very closely\\ninfluenced, have been very dependent upon their religious\\nconceptions and upon their scientific knowledge and ideas.\\nNow, not to go farther, we have at least four important lines of\\nhuman interest and activity which have influenced the moral\\nhistory of mankind, and these four influences have not been\\nparallel; sometimes one has been uppermost and the others\\nbackward, and so we do not find a steady, uniform course of\\ndevelopment. For example, so far as the connection between\\nmorals and science, the free play of man\\'s intelligence and man\\'s\\nintellectual life is concerned, so far as the connection of morals\\nwith a somewhat narrow but intense form of social organization\\nis concerned, we should be hard put to equal the achievements of\\nGreek life at its best practice in Athens; but so far as morality\\nwas connected with and dependent upon industry and commerce\\nand a wide net-work of peaceable relations, so far also as it was\\ndependent upon well established and well ascertained methods\\nof legal procedure, we should find Athenian morality quite\\nbackward. On the other hand, some of the great empires, especially\\nsome of the Oriental empires, have been distinctly advanced in\\nall matters of morality that have to do with commercial integrity,\\nwith the making and keeping of promises, carrying out of\\ncontracts. In the Babylonian Empire, for instance, to be a clever\\ntrader was almost synonymous with being more or less of a liar.\\nWe all know how high the standard of commercial morality is in\\nthe great Empire of China.\\nUpon the whole again, in the Mediaeval period there was,\\nupon the religious side, a great sensitiveness of emotions to\\ncertain forms of distinctively ethical value, but we all know that\\nthere was a backwardness in the matter of science, of the play of\\nintelligence, of industry and commerce and certain other forms.\\n  \\n                            \\nNow because these various forces which have modified the\\nmoral history of mankind have not proceeded parallel with each\\nother, because one has been uppermost and then another, the\\nfortunes of morality have been distinctly checked. It has had its\\nups and downs; one phase of morals has been almost, perhaps, at\\nits culmination, when another has been in very backward\\ncondition. Under these circumstances, about all one can do is to pick\\nout certain of the larger features of the moral history of mankind,\\nwhere, upon the whole, we can be sure that there has been a\\nfairly steady, uniform movement in one direction. That is where\\nafter all these various forces, political, legal, economic, religious\\nand scientific, have modified each other and have reenforced\\neach other, so that there has been a certain convergence of\\ndirection.\\nNow the first great achievement in moral history that I shall\\nmention has been the widening, the extension of the field, of the\\narea of human beings between whom moral relations exist. In\\nthe enlarging and expansion of the field of human beings who\\nrecognize that they have moral responsibility and moral rights in\\nrespect to each other, the first knowledge of mankind—what we\\ncall primitive man, though even then he probably was quite\\nadvanced in his career—the unit of organization is the clan, a\\ngroup of persons supposed to have the closest kind of blood\\nkinship with each other, consisting at the most of only a few\\nhundred people. Now within that narrow clan, bound together by\\nthese blood ties, there were many moral duties and\\nresponsibilities which were very sharply marked out, but beyond this very\\nnarrow limit, there were practically no moral relationships, no\\nethical obligations whatsoever recognized on the outside, for the\\nstranger, the foreigner, the alien was presumably an enemy,\\nand if not an enemy, he was a person toward whom they were\\nmorally and ethically indifferent; no duties of honesty, of regard\\nfor life, of chastity, no duties whatsoever, excepting hospitality\\nunder certain peculiar conditions, was the stranger or foreigner\\nentitled to.\\nNow, as we trace the history of mankind, we find the scope of\\nthis field enlarging, until now in theory at least, the field of moral\\nrelations is as broad as humanity itself and has been influenced\\nundoubtedly by the stoic philosophy of the ^Roman poet who\\nsaid that he esteemed nothing human foreign to himself. He was\\n  \\n                            \\nexpressing at one of the earliest times in history an idea which\\nit had taken long centuries, long millennial periods of human\\nstruggle to work out, and even then of course the statement was\\nmore or less a conventional one, a literary phrase rather than the\\nstatement of an actuality, for the larger part of mankind was still\\ndistinctly foreign and alien even to the most advanced moralist of\\nthe Roman Empire; and even to-day, while theoretically we\\nrecognize the brotherhood of all mankind, or the fact that moral\\nduties and relations exist wherever human beings come together,\\nno matter what their differences of race, economic condition or\\nreligion, we still know that we are dealing with an ideal\\nsomething that we hope for, that we cherish and hope will come into\\nexistence, rather than a fact, for our international relations. Our\\nstruggle for peace, our struggle against war shows as a matter of\\nfact that we do not yet recognize the same rules of morality as\\nbinding towards other people that we acknowledge in our\\nrelations to our own people. We are living a sort of enlarged clan\\nmorality still.\\nMany moral relations cease or may cease at a moment\\'s notice\\nto large numbers of people outside of our own kin, and of course\\nour morality is still affected by partisan considerations, by\\ndistinctions as to social status, economic classes, and so on. Not to\\ndwell upon the incomplete, inadequate features of the situation,\\nit is true that there has been steady development, something we\\nmay call evolution in this direction, in the enlarging and\\nwidening of the field within which ethical relationships are\\nacknowledged, and to a considerable extent are acted upon.\\nNow along with that, in the second place, there has been a\\nsubstitution of a more uniform, impersonal standard and ideal\\nof action. When it was said that God was no respecter of\\npersons, there was a marked, an extraordinary advance which had\\ntaken place in human history, over all the earlier Gods. Jehovah\\nhimself, as reflected in a large part of the Old Testament, was\\ndistinctly a respecter of persons, of groups, of nations; He had his\\nown selected people in whose fortunes He was interested, and\\nHe had another standard of judgment for them than that\\ndisplayed towards other people. Now here, as so often, the logical\\nconception simply marked, in somewhat vague and projected\\nform, the ordinary ethical conception, and we find, at the\\nbeginning of the earlier stages of human history that there were as\\n  \\n                            \\nmany different moral codes, as many different standards and as\\nmany different ways of applying these standards as there were\\ndifferent social groups. Even in what we now regard, perhaps, as\\ndistinctively the dawn of our own civilization upon the Teutonic\\nside, we find, for example, penalties for wrongdoing very\\ndefinitely graded according to the social status of the one who is\\noffending and the one who is offended; for a peasant or a low\\nclass person to offend in any way against the person or the\\nproperty of a nobleman was a most serious offense; for the nobleman\\nto offend against his equal was a serious offense, but for him to\\noffend against a serf or a slave was a comparatively trivial,\\nnegligible offense. It would be absolutely impossible, even if I had a\\ngreat many hours at command, to begin to recite the inequalities,\\nthe inequities, or the distinctions made for persons and for all\\nkinds of circumstances and conditions that appear to us purely\\narbitrary. In the long history of humanity, the advance of what\\nwe call justice, the advance of what we call equity, is primarily\\nthis—the recognition that there is a single standard of judgment,\\na single basis of rights and of duties, with respect to which all\\nindividuals, no matter what their class or condition, are equal;\\nthat all persons are to be served, in other words, alike, morally\\nspeaking. I will not stop here to cite or recite how far we have\\nstill come short, in many ways, of practicing this idea, but at all\\nevents, we have the idea, and we are sensitive, as the people in\\nthe past, in the period of history mentioned were not sensitive;\\nwe are sensitive to our deviations from the idea of the single,\\nuniform, all-embracing standard for judging and treating\\nmankind; we are uneasy about it, and we are taking more or less\\ntentative and faltering steps to get away from these inequities.\\nIn the third place, the history of human morals shows\\ncontinually a larger part played by intelligence, played by man\\'s best\\njudgment, working by the best methods that it can employ in\\njudging human actions and in forming its schedule of the things\\nthat it regards as virtues, as desirable, and the things that it\\nregards as vices and to be reprehended. I do not know how to put\\nbefore you, in a moment, this progress along the line of the\\nimportance attached to intelligence, but perhaps the best way to\\ndo it is negatively by indicating some of the many, many ways in\\nthe past history of men\\'s moral thought in which it would seem\\nas if anything but intelligence, anything but judgment and\\n  \\n                            \\nreflection had been employed to determine the rights and the wrongs,\\nthe goods and the bads of human action.\\nIn the early history and the middle, and to some extent even\\nthe later history of the moral ideas and practices, mankind was\\nbound up, in a most entangled way, with things which most\\npeople to-day frankly call superstition, and even their better\\nideas that we should pick out as most akin to our own best moral\\nideas to-day were not free; they were not put forth on their own\\ngrounds to win assent and consent for what they were, but they\\nfound their sanction, their motives, their justification in the most\\nirrational kind of consideration. The fact of taboo, the fact that\\nsome individuals, or certain classes of individuals, could put a\\nsort of spell on objects or on persons, and make them in some\\nway sacred and holy, endowed with certain magical powers\\nwhich would bring evil to anybody that touched them, was for\\nlong ages of human history probably the chief motive in securing\\nregard sometimes for personal life and in almost all cases for\\nproperty or personal belongings. The sacredness or stability\\nof property among certain savage peoples otherwise not far\\nadvanced has often been noted, and without any wish to in any\\nway derogate from the moral standard, these people seemed to\\nbe, in many respects, quite superior to men of to-day. In fact,\\nproperty could be left anywhere, almost, and then found again\\nwhen wanted. A careful study has shown this was because a\\ncertain taboo or magic spell had been put upon these things and\\npeople feared to touch them because of the magical curse or spell\\nthat would follow them, if they in any way came near or even put\\na finger upon this property. Now for ages it would seem as if the\\nchief moral influence sanctioned, the motive operating upon\\nmankind had been taboos or semi-magic spells of various kinds\\nrather than a principle or idea which would commend itself to\\nthe enlightened intelligence; consequently a great deal of the\\nmoral energy of mankind, the intellectual, practical energy of\\nmankind was diverted into all kinds of perfectly useless and\\nirrational channels. It would sometimes seem as if the barbarous\\nraces, those who did not advance very far, had the best of it as\\ncompared with certain other peoples who had made a further\\nadvance, because these more barbarous peoples were at least left\\nfree from all of those rules and fears and rights and cults that\\nhad grown up in connection with these magic and quasi-magic\\n  \\n                            \\nnotions. When this conception, that morality or things of\\nmorals, matters of right and wrong, of good and evil, were things of a\\nmetaphysical character, which could be reposed in things and\\nwhich were contagious and infectious, working by some sort of\\nspiritual, unknown means and rules, there grew up the most\\nelaborate codes of activity, in which moral interests centered,\\ncomplicated rituals and cults for avoiding all kinds of impurity\\nor contact with any of these infections, and equally elaborate\\ncults for purifying by all kinds of symbolic and semi-magical\\nmeans the results from any possible infection. These things really\\nengaged, to an incredible extent, the activities of very large\\nnumbers of people, especially those people who prided themselves on\\nbeing the superior class, morally, spiritually and scientifically. It\\nwas the lower classes, who had to make a living and had to make\\nenough living so that these other people also might have a living,\\nwho are doing ninety-nine one-hundredths of the useful work of\\nlife. It is impossible to conceive of the extent to which the actual\\nprogress of mankind has been kept back by this deviation of\\nintellectual and moral practices. In contrast to this, one can\\nconceive of what is meant by speaking of the advance in morals\\nalong the greater regard for intelligence and for man\\'s best\\njudgment in determining the consequences of conduct and of\\nintelligently using what we can find out about the consequences of\\nconduct, the natural, inevitable and social consequences, and use\\nthat factor in determining the right and wrong; only in that way\\ncan we see what great moral advance has been made.\\nThis leads me to my last and fourth point along which the\\nmoral advance has been marked, namely, a freeing of the powers\\nof the individual. We often think, and for a long time it was the\\nonly way to think, of the savage as a man who is perfectly free,\\nwho is not in any bonds or under any rules or laws at all, but one\\nwho does just exactly as he likes. As a matter of fact, the larger\\npart of his life is enmeshed with all kinds of taboos and fixed\\nregulations; the individual had no private property, for example,\\nin the sense of anything which he could dispose of or sell or part\\nwith; he had no individual rights whatever; the rights he had\\nwere simply because he was a member of a certain family, or of a\\ncertain caste, or of a certain social class.\\nThe history of political liberty and the history of the growth of\\neconomic freedom, the evolution of slavery, of serfdom, and the\\n  \\n                            \\nreduction of the actual operations and depressions that come\\nwith great industrial inequalities, even when there is, legally\\nspeaking, no slavery—these great advances on the political\\nand the economic side have reflected themselves in a greater\\nregard for individual capacity in every form. The conception for\\nanything approaching universal education is an extremely\\nmodern conception, hardly over one hundred years old, and as an\\nactively operating idea, not even one hundred years old. Now, no\\nsuch ideal as this one of universal education would be\\nconceivable, were it not that we have come to have respect and a\\nreverence for all kinds of individual capacities simply because they are\\ncapacities of some human being.\\nIt is often said, and said truly that the older codes of morality,\\nput in the form of \"do this or that thing\" or, \"do not do this or\\nthat thing,\" evolved certain actions, external over-actions, which\\nwere enjoyed, and as long as these external things were done, it\\nmade no especial difference what the attitude, what the capacity\\nor the frame of mind of the individual in doing them. We are\\nmuch more wary and cautious than we used to be about\\nprescribing a definite code of external prohibitions and of external\\ninjunctions to perform just this and that task. We confine\\nourselves largely to simply enjoining and forbidding some of the\\ncoarser aspects of conduct, without which society could not hold\\nitself together at all, but we are much more sensitive and much\\nmore eager about the things that have to do with the individual\\ncapacities and individual attitude towards life, that each may\\nmake the most of himself. On the other hand, we should see to it\\nthat opportunities are provided every individual, so that he may\\nmake the most of himself. All that goes with the development of\\nthe notion of democracy, which, as a social and a moral ideal,\\nhas marked one of the most fundamental and important lines of\\nmoral progress, for this democracy as a moral ideal becomes\\nessentially a matter of respect and reverence for the capacities of\\nthe individual, because there is something unique in him not\\nfound in others, and for that very reason, all the more precious\\nand all the more reason why the individual should have the\\nopportunity to make the most of himself.\\nIt is possible, to go back to my first point, that this\\ncomparative lateness of the development of a sense of individuality\\nand of what goes with that is largely accountable for the\\n  \\n                            \\ncheckered, the up and down career and fortunes of the moral history\\nof mankind; at all events, it shows us the point of view from\\nwhich the evolution of morality, the future possible evolution, is\\nto be conceived. With the rights of the conception of evolution,\\nmany people have seized upon it as if evolution furnished a sort\\nof big automobile, which was carrying the world and carrying\\nthe human race on, anyway, to a certain destiny, as if evolution\\nmarked out a certain predestined force; that we were riding upon\\nit and riding forward inevitably to a better and better condition.\\nThe notion has been used to sanctify, as it were, a great deal of\\nvery cheap and very harmful optimism about what was going on\\nand what was sure to go on morally.\\nNow with this deepening sense of the individual we come to\\nrealize more and more after all that it is not any force which we\\ncall evolution which is going to bring any further development of\\nmorals that we shall have, but it is rather certain attitudes in\\nhuman nature itself that we have to depend upon instead of this\\nimpersonal, external force. We have to rely upon human\\nintelligence and we have to rely upon good faith, good faith as to\\nourselves, sincerity, and the equal attribution of good faith to other\\npeople, even when they are doing things that we do not exactly\\nunderstand because of their individuality; and we have to rely\\nupon what is very close to that, the growth of sympathy. It is the\\nfreeing of these powers of intelligence, of the attribution of good\\nfaith wherever possible, and the development of sympathetic\\nregard, the freeing of these forces which has been after all the net\\noutcome of the human development of morals up to this time;\\nfor their future more vital and more energetic activity we will\\nhave to depend upon the evolution of future mankind.\\n  \\n                            \\nSome Connexions of Science and Philosophy [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 52, folder 1, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1911-12.]\\n»»\\nScience, like the school-master, is abroad. It is\\ndangerous to raise any question of the extent of its ranging, lest one\\nthereby proclaim that one is not one\\'s self abroad, but is living in\\na retired corner. Yet as philosophy was of old but love of wisdom\\nnot its possession, so it is possible to-day that philosophy is\\nneither an analysis nor a synthesis of science, but a questioning\\nof its uses—its relations—in life. Not that I mean to raise the\\njejune question as to whether science is of use and if so of what\\nuse, but to indicate that whatever science is or is not, and\\nwhatever its contents are and are not, living is for man a broader\\naffair than knowing; and that hence it is for life, and not for\\nknowledge, to say what is the place of knowledge in that life; none\\nthe less for it to say, even if it cannot tell truly without knowledge.\\nThere has never been a time since philosophy began when it\\nwas not defined either as a comprehensive synthesis of all\\nscience, or as a criticism, rectification and extension of the partial\\nand hence distorted conceptions of the special sciences or as an\\nanalysis of these conceptions and of the methods that attend\\nthem with a view to discovering the ultimate traits of existence. I\\nshall not here refer to the fact that it is not obvious how a\\nphilosophy that professes to be built exclusively upon science is to\\nlearn from science itself to which one of these three structures to\\ndevote itself. Neither shall I now point out what an elastic and\\naccommodating term science has shown itself through the ages,\\nfrom the dialectically won insight of Plato, the theology of the\\nmiddle ages, seventeenth century astronomy, to the\\nmathematical physics of today.\\nSuch remarks are possibly but carping, and in any case are but\\n  \\n                            \\nsymptoms of a more significant matter. The philosophies that\\npurport to be built upon science both take advantage of and\\nrepudiate the struggles—the very human struggles—that have\\ngone to the making of science; they prize the jewels of human\\nbelief that have been mined, but the efforts involved in the mind\\nand the aims involved in regarding them as jewels are treated as\\npart of the rubbish and debris that has been got rid of in the\\nmining operations. And in making science, like the Moral Will\\nof Kant, a jewel in its own behalf, apart from the lives that it\\nillumines, these philosophies also tend to make science, like the\\nKantian goodness, an empty and a futile thing.\\nFor it was man and not science that educated man into\\nbecoming a scientific man; and it is man, not science, that commends\\nand eulogizes science. It is no part of the business of science to\\nanoint itself with priestly unctions or to issue testimonials to\\nitself. The more the importance of science is insisted upon, the\\nmore is implied a context of an experience proceeding from and\\nterminating in irrational life sufferings, struggles and trials. A\\nphilosophy will have enough to learn from science and enough to\\ndo with it that frankly takes for its task the business of making\\nas articulate as possible the ties that connect the methods and\\nresults of science with blind human effort, defeat and\\nachievement. It will doubtless be called upon, among other things, to\\nanalyze, to synthesize and to criticize various scientific\\nconceptions. But these operations will not be carried on in the interest\\nof science or in the presumptuous expectation of extending or\\nrectifying or supplementing science in its own sense and\\ndirection, but with a view to promoting a freer and more facile give-\\nand-take of intercourse between science and a humanity whose\\nchief concern is to make a living that is worth while.\\nPerhaps I trench upon a field from which I have already warned\\nmyself away when I say that the very conception of a single, self-\\nenclosed somewhat called Science is largely a superstition. The\\nvitality of this superstition is a tribute at once to the power\\nof words to dominate thinking, and to the capacity of a\\nunified emotional response and interest to insinuate itself into\\nobjective facts and speciously confer upon them their own quality\\nof inclusiveness and exclusiveness. It is easier consciously to\\nridicule Plato than to cease being his unconscious disciples; and\\nI know of no philosophy more certain to be suffused with\\n  \\n                            \\npersonal emotional reactions than one which professes itself to\\nbe a colorless objectivism—as witness the attitude of adoration,\\npartly pedantic and partly barbaric, of our Neo-Realism to that\\nPlatonic entity which they have baptized Science.\\nI quote from a recent utterance of an anthropological authority\\nof the very first rank a testimony all the more valuable, because\\nnot made with any philosophic issue in view.\\nI believe it is a mistake to assume that the interpretation\\nmade by each civilized individual is a complete logical\\nprocess. We associate a phenomenon with a number of known\\nfacts, the interpretations of which are assumed as known,\\nand we are satisfied with the reduction of a new fact to these\\npreviously known facts. For instance, if the average\\nindividual hears of the explosion of a previously unknown chemical,\\nhe is satisfied to reason that certain materials are known to\\nhave the property of exploding under proper conditions, and\\nthat consequently the unknown substance has the same\\nquality. On the whole I do not think that we should try to\\nargue still further, and really try to give a full explanation of\\nthe causes of the explosion.\\nThe difference in the mode of thought of primitive man\\nand that of civilized man seems to consist largely in the\\ndifference of character of the traditional material with which\\nthe new perception associates itself. The instruction given to\\nthe child of primitive man is not based on centuries of\\nexperimentation, but consists of the crude experience of\\ngenerations. When a new experience enters the mind of primitive\\nman, the same process which we observe among civilized\\nman brings about an entirely different series of associations,\\nand therefore results in a different type of explanation. A\\nsudden explosion will associate itself in his mind, perhaps,\\nwith tales which he has heard in regard to the mythical\\nhistory of the world, and consequently will be accompanied\\nby superstitious fear. When we recognize that neither among\\ncivilized men nor among primitive men the average\\nindividual carries to completion the attempt at causal explanation of\\nphenomena, but carries it only so far as to amalgamate it\\nwith other previously known facts, we recognize that the\\nresult of the whole process depends entirely upon the\\ncharacter of the traditional material. . . .\\n  \\n                            \\nIn scientific inquiries we should always be clear in our own\\nminds of the fact that we always embody a number of\\nhypotheses and theories in our explanations, and that we do\\nnot carry the analysis of any given phenomenon to\\ncompletion. In fact, if we were to do so, progress would hardly be\\npossible, because every phenomenon would require an\\nendless amount of time for thorough treatment. We are only too\\napt, however, to forget entirely the general, and for most of\\nus purely traditional, theoretical basis which is the\\nfoundation of our reasoning, and to assume that the result of our\\nreasoning is absolute truth. In this we commit the same error\\nthat is committed, and has been committed, by all the less\\ncivilized peoples.\\nIt would be just neither to Dr. Boas, the writer of these lines The Mind of Primitive Man, 202-206.\\n»1\\nnor to my own purpose in citing them to give the impression\\nthat their object is to create scepticism concerning the value of\\nscience, or to suggest that, after all, the differences between our\\nscientific traditions and the myths of early man are insignificant\\nas compared with an underlying identity. Professor Boas\\'s motive\\nis to show that the difference between primitive beliefs and those\\nof contemporary civilized man is due not to differences of\\ninherent mental structure and capacity but to the cultural medium in\\nwhich individuals think and act. My own purpose is simply to\\nemphasize the fact that there is such a medium, and that science\\nitself, even in its own internal intellectual content reflects it. In\\nsome sense, science is a function of this cultural medium. It\\nreacts upon environing social life, and by this reaction gradually\\ntransforms the latter. But the context can no more be excluded\\nand science remain, than a man can lift himself without a\\nphysical leverage beyond himself.\\nHence the arbitrary nature and the almost arid tendency of the\\nphilosophies (or parts of philosophies) that purport to build\\nupon science alone. Take such portions of the philosophies of\\nAristotle, Descartes and Spencer as claim to analyze or else to\\nsystematize and extend the well established results of science.\\nWhat do we find? The most valuable and permanent parts of\\ntheir ideas? Rather material which is exceedingly important as\\nsymptomatic of the social spirit and imaginative temper of the\\n  \\n                            \\nday, but material whose intrinsic intellectual value is outworn\\nand trivial compared with remarks these same writers make\\nwhen they frankly give their interpretation of some attitude of\\nlife or their estimate of the value of some standing tendency of\\nhuman nature.\\nScience is science. It is corrected by more science. Equally it is\\nextended and built out by scientific men using scientific\\nmethods, not by philosophic syntheses however comprehensive, nor\\nby definitions however acute. The results of such extensions and\\nexcavations may not, to be sure, turn out to be science; but\\nneither will they turn out to be philosophy. They will only turn\\nout to be poor science. That a philosopher may make respectable\\ncontributions to a science is a likely enough supposition, and\\none to which history has given some confirmation. His\\nphilosophic antecedents may count as an asset, as well as a liability, in\\nmaking the contribution. But they operate pedagogically, so to\\nspeak, not philosophically; they help or hinder just as part of the\\nintellectual equipment brought into play.\\nOf course, the same is true, mutatis mutandis, of the scientific\\nman turned philosopher. He may try to combine into larger\\nintellectual wholes the results of highly specialized sciences; he may\\neven engage in the more dubious task of arriving at a\\n\"completely unified knowledge.\" But the outcome is either a\\ncontribution to one of the special sciences, or to creating a hyphenated\\nscience (like astro-physics, physiological-psychology, etc.) that\\nsprings up to cover the gaps left in a prior conventional\\ndivisioning of the field—or else, again, to the mythology of science,\\nan interesting department to which Sir Isaac Newton as well\\nas Plato has paid tribute. And again he may say something of\\nimmense importance for philosophy—something that he would\\nnot have said without his scientific training. But here, again, his\\nscience operates in making him more sensitive to some human\\npredicament, not enclosed within the mesh of a science.\\nI do not know whether it is necessary to disclaim the intention\\nof minimizing the importance of science for philosophy, but it is\\ngenerally safe to assume misunderstanding, actual or latent, in\\nany discussion in or about philosophy. So I shall point out a\\nnumber of points of contact and cross-fertilization of science and\\nphilosophy. In the first place, philosophy can and does render a\\nservice of criticism to science. But it is capable of performing this\\n  \\n                            \\npurging service just because there is so much in science that is\\nnot scientific in origin and which persists without scientific\\nsanction. It is not difficult to find cases where notions that originated\\nwithin philosophy have been taken up by some science, and have\\nbecome influential there. There was the notion, for example, of\\nthe fixity of species with its long role in the sciences of life. The\\nnotion was familiar, of course, to common sense and had an\\nimmense amount of familiar observation to sustain it. But it was\\ndefinitely formulated within philosophy, explained and justified\\non general philosophic grounds. Moreover, it was criticized as a\\npiece of philosophic apparatus, in its form of the separation and\\nfixity of conceptions, before it received critical examination in\\nbiologic science. I could pick out in contemporary psychologies,\\npsychologies that are ultra-scientific in temper, many survivals of\\na conception of consciousness, of conscious process and state,\\nthat originated within philosophy for the purposes of\\nphilosophy. And philosophy to-day, in some of its representatives at\\nleast, is much more critical of these conceptions than the average\\nworking scientific psychologist shows much disposition to be.\\nSome of these ideas persist among the sciences, I believe, simply\\nbecause they are of so little importance there—because their\\nsignificance is hardly more than verbal. Almost every student of\\nphilosophy has had occasion to note and sometimes to marvel at\\nthe equanimity with which scientific men tolerate as part of their\\nnominal equipment ideas that seem to be anachronisms, ideas\\nthat a little reflection would throw into the discard as quite\\ninconsistent with scientifically established facts. In most cases,\\nthe explanation, I fancy, is quite simple. These ideas do not\\nactually function, and it is easier to let them alone and devote the\\ntime thus saved to some research. Scientific men generally, in\\nfact, stigmatize as \"metaphysical\" those of their brethren who\\nshow any disposition to get excited over such of their current\\nnotions as do not directly affect the conduct of experimental\\ninquiry.\\nBut, as has been already suggested, the sciences also carry\\nalong with them foreign ideas that are not innocuously\\nimbedded—like boulders from another stratum. There are some ideas\\npicked up and assigned scientific standing that do harm; they\\nconventionalize and restrict inquiry. They direct it into unfertile\\nfields and favor a misconception of the results reached in fruitful\\n  \\n                            \\nfields. Naturally we cannot tell offhand just what and where they\\nare in the science of today. But even mathematics has only very\\nrecently got around to substituting a scientific determination\\nof an axiom for the old popular \"self-evident truth.\" The\\nbiological sciences on account of their recentness are probably quite\\ninfested with unfortunate borrowings and transfers. Almost any\\ncritical person could pick out in the still newer social sciences\\nhighly influential ideas which are at least subject to arrest as\\nsuspicious characters, intellectual vagabonds without legitimate\\nmeans of support.\\nNow when the philosopher deals with such concepts he is\\nquite on his own ground. Frequently, indeed, he is occupying\\nhimself with the products of prior philosophic industry when he\\nconsiders such notions. The outcome of his examination may\\nhave a liberating effect upon science: not because the ideas dealt\\nwith are categories of science—not even because they are\\ncategories of unscience, but because his examination may place the\\nideas in their proper universe of discourse, and by putting them\\nin their own social context relieve science of an incubus.\\nThe criticizing work of philosophy need not terminate abruptly\\nat this point. Various terms characteristic of scientific inquiry\\nare also employed in other callings of life. A comparison of\\nthe meanings they possess in these different contexts may well\\nbe illuminating, and at times is necessary as a policing against\\nambiguities. If, however, one determines the meanings of such a\\nterm as cause in science and in practical affairs, there is no sense\\nin concluding that the scientific conception is the conception\\nto which that of daily life must be made to square. The\\nconclusion is that the scientific notion is the meaning of causation for\\npurposes of knowledge and that the practical fact is the fact for\\npurposes of practice. Beyond the clarification that may come\\nfrom such a distinction, the criticism may be of further value, for\\nthe distinction of meanings ^puts in condensed and more\\nmanageable form the general question of the relation that science\\nbears to practical occupations.\\nTo my mind such considerations as these exhaust the scope of\\none of the conventionally proper things to say about the relations\\nof science and philosophy: namely, that each special science\\npresupposes, assumes without inquiry, some special conception or\\ngroup of conceptions, building itself thereon. Philosophy then\\n  \\n                            \\ncomes in—so it is said—to examine and criticize these uncritical\\nassumptions, having the further task of organizing the purged\\nconceptions into an intellectual system. Without such a work, we\\nare told, the sciences indeed may get on very well as specialized\\npursuits, but after all get on only by begging their own premisses\\nwhich remain unsanctioned and obnoxiously open to sceptical\\nqueries. I waive the miracle that the sciences should be able to\\nget on so well if they really were using ideas which are not\\nclearly understood and which are without adequate justification.\\nI shall take the simpler method of dogmatic denial and dogmatic\\nassertion. I do not believe this orthodox view has anything to\\ncommend it save the ease with which it may be uttered.\\nGeometry does not take an unexamined notion of space as its\\nbasis and then rear its scientific superstructure. Geometry takes\\ncertain facts and their qualities as its starting point and then\\narrives at its conception of space by dealing with these facts. Its\\nconception of space is a highly critical result and a highly\\nsystematized one. It would be truer to say that the system of\\ngeometry is the critical and organized conception of space than to say\\nthat geometry is derived from or is built upon some hastily\\nsnatched notion which remains at the end still unexamined as to\\nits inner meaning and ultimate validity. From the standpoint of\\nknowledge, of intellectual inquiry, testing and organization, the\\nscience of geometry says all there is to say about the notion of\\nspace, instead of leaving it over for a philosopher to say the\\nfundamental things about it. If the philosopher suspects that in\\nthe current system of geometry there are unexamined and\\nunsystematized notions, his sole recourse is to criticize the current\\ngeometrical results and improve the science—in short, engage in\\nthe very business the geometers are themselves endlessly engaged\\nin. When the philosopher takes it upon himself to regard the\\nconceptions of space, time, energy, matter, motion with which\\nthe sciences deal as untested, haphazard notions which it is his\\nprivilege to sanction and arrange, the chances are about n to one\\nthat the result will be neither science nor philosophy.\\nThe kernel of truth in the orthodox view lies in the two points\\nalready noted. The sciences after all still retain some infiltration\\nof popular traditions, prior philosophic or theological\\nenterprises with respect to which philosophy may have a purging\\nwork to do. The facts that are employed in arriving at the\\n  \\n                            \\nscientific conception appear in other contexts than that of science.\\nSpace qualities function, for example, esthetically, as well as\\nmathematically. Motion and force are qualities of effort as well\\nas terms of knowledge. To compare the respective ways in which\\nthe same facts are utilized in their different contexts for different\\npurposes may well be an important part of the philosophic\\nundertaking. But only confusion arises when this task is regarded\\nas either a rectification or an extension, from the standpoint of\\nknowledge, of the scientific conception. The confusion and the\\nresulting scandal to intelligence are as great whether we pit the\\nscientific definition of motion against the practical, the vital,\\nqualities (of which, after all, it is the intellectual definition),\\ndenying the reality of their existence because they are not the\\nsame as the scientific content, or assign to the scientific result a\\nlow intellectual place because it isn\\'t the same as the vital\\nqualities themselves. Why should time for example present itself in\\nexactly the same form in mathematical physics and in the\\ncontext of waiting for Roosevelt to make up his mind whether or no\\nto become a candidate for the presidency? Finding that time\\npresents different traits in the two contexts why insist that one\\npresentation is alone the real one, and the other an imitation or a\\nmake-belief? The obvious fact seems to be that in the region of\\nknowledge, for the purposes of science, the scientific conception\\nis the only conception; and in the sphere of action and esthetic\\nappreciation where qualities are the essentials, quality is the only\\nquality. Accept this point of view, and we shall have done with\\nthe idea that philosophy must revise or sanction a scientific idea.\\nUnless the forest has disappeared in the trees, it will be\\napparent that what I am trying to say is that philosophy is not\\nconcerned at all with science as science, and that when it ventures in\\nthat direction the result, unless overruled by a special\\nprovidence, is poor science. But something positive is implied in this\\nnegation. Philosophy is concerned with the places where science\\ntouches life, the points at which it borrows and at which it lends,\\nwhere it is generated and where it operates. There are vital, there\\nare constructive interactions of the practice of knowing with\\nother concerns of our common life. These nodal points, these\\njunctures, give philosophy its problems. History teems with\\nexamples of ideas first worked out and made at home in industry\\nand commerce that found their way into science for its\\n  \\n                            \\nanimation and direction. Take, for instance, the origins of mechanical\\nscience. Greek inquiry made some marvellous advances in the\\ndirection of modern scientific methods. The human body was\\nheld in high esteem; physiology and medicine flourished. The\\nstars retained the dignity of their divine elevation; astronomy\\nmade headway. There has almost always been a close, probably\\na logical, connexion between the literary-dialectical method\\nand pure mathematics; geometry was elaborated. But the Greek\\ngentleman felt himself demeaned by contact with the productive\\ncrafts and their tools. The problems, the fruitful suggestions, the\\nmeans, the physical appliances of experimentation were thus\\nexcluded save in exceptional cases. But as the arts developed in\\nless aristocratic neighborhoods, and the artisan became a social\\nfigure of greater dignity, experimental and mechanical science\\nbecame inevitable. The questions, the technique, the apparatus\\nof its inquiry were all evolved in the control of nature brought\\nabout by industries aiming to satisfy the needs of daily life. The\\nlogic of Descartes and Bacon were but halting attempts to\\ntranscribe the operations of the once despised mechanic into the\\nlanguage of science.\\nThe biological conception of evolution affords another\\ninstance. Today the layman can hardly read with understanding\\nthe contributions that are making. But the earlier hours of this\\nidea of evolution were spent in the company of political idealists\\nproclaiming the indefinite perfectibility of man, and of social\\ninterpreters trying to resist the dissolving tendencies of a purely\\nindividualistic rationalism by conceiving history as the\\nprogressive development of one continuous whole—humanity. It\\nis also pertinent to note that Malthus\\'s theory of population\\nwas the chief document in the reaction against this optimistic\\nperfectionism, and that Malthus was still sufficiently imbued\\nwith deistic piety to wish to justify the scantiness of the board\\nwhich nature set for her own children on the ground that this\\nniggardliness was a needed providential spur to work and to\\ninvention—the sources of human progress. It is all the more\\npertinent because Darwin has recorded his personal indebtedness to\\nthis doctrine of political economy for his conceptions of struggle\\nfor existence, selection and survival, as keys to understanding\\nthe origin of species.\\nScience is itself a vast cooperative social endeavor, impossible\\n  \\n                            \\nsave where conditions make possible the dividing of tasks and\\nthe bringing together of the distributed results. Without the\\nmodern appliances for publication and exchange and intercourse\\nmodern science would be an idle dream. In more ways than one\\nit is the offspring of the industrial revolution as in more ways\\nthan one it is its parent. For science gives as well as takes. What is\\ncalled the conflict of science and religion is not a conflict of two\\nabstractions, two Platonic entities, but of social groups and\\nforces. In spite of what literary critics say, literature is written by\\nmen and women and not by imagination and abstract faculties,\\nand men and women are subject to the influences of their times.\\nNo matter what coop an artist may build to shut himself in (and\\nit is generally the critics not the productive artist that build and\\nlabel these coops) his work is inwrought with scientific\\ninfluences. Not that he does or should post himself upon the last\\nscientific discovery before he writes, much less that he should\\nwrite with the latest novelty of science upon his penpoint (the\\nscientific romance being a strong contender with the historic\\nromance for ineptitude), but that the life which solicits him, that\\npresents to him the problem life puts to life, has itself sucked\\navidly in the differences in belief and practice that science makes.\\nOne more instance and these illustrations conclude. Under the\\ninfluence of certain vested, institutionalized traditions, the\\nrelation of science and morals has been conceived in a negative spirit,\\nas a matter of protective insurance. How shall we save some\\nscrap of freedom, of the ideal, of responsibility, from the\\ndevastating influence of the conceptions of natural science? This way\\nof feeling and putting the question is, however, itself a mark of a\\nsocial life in which science has made little headway, and where\\nthe procedure of intelligence is not thought of as openminded\\ninquiry, competently fitted out with the needed apparatus, but as\\nthe dialectical elaboration of antithetical concepts—an eternal\\nintellectual law suit. What is now beginning to show as the\\nsignificant point of contact of modern science with our moral life\\nis the carrying over into behavior, individual and collective, of\\nthe way of thinking, of questioning and testing characteristic of\\nexperimental inquiries into natural events. For the most part\\nmoral standards are still thought of as dogmatically, as rigidly, as\\nif the inductive conception of law and its importance as a tool of\\ninquiry had never been heard of, or else, in irritated reaction\\n  \\n                            \\nagainst the unreasonable and external constraint of any morality\\ndogmatically conceived, there is a recourse to a deification of\\nindividual inclination, that again completely ignores the\\ndiscovery in science of a method of intelligence that is watchful,\\nexacting and obeying no law but that of its own end.\\nIt is not too much to say that the philosophy of a period always\\nfocusses in the science of the time. Whatever of significance\\nand scope seems to some to be lost in refusing to philosophy\\nlicense to burrow below science or to round out its ragged edges\\nis more than made up for by holding philosophy to its own\\nbusiness of reinterpreting human concerns in the light of the\\nadvances in the method and outcome of intelligence that we\\ncall science. Housekeepers become in time acutely conscious of\\nthe extremely limited number of animals that may be drawn\\nupon for food. Persons experienced in the larger economy of life\\nbecome aware of the small number of interests that make it\\nup and of their comparative stability—almost monotony. Left\\nto themselves they change but little, or change as do sand dunes\\non a wind swept shore. The forms gave way to one another with\\ngreat rapidity, but the \"more they are different, the more they are\\nthe same.\"\\nSignificant differences in politics, morals, religion, art,\\nindustry are all due to changes in the temper and outlook of the\\nimagination. Were we gifted with capacity of observation but\\nlacking in the community of mind due to intercourse, what\\na drearily monotonous scene the actions of our fellow beings\\nwould present! We have just so many muscles and there are just\\nso many combinations and coordinations possible—more,\\nindeed, than the number of motions that may be made by a horse\\'s\\nlegs but hardly enough more to take account of. But these\\nexternal movements are fraught with meanings that vary, that grow,\\nthat take on hue after hue of idea and shade after shade of\\ndiscrimination. Intelligence, reflection, knowledge permeate them,\\nand each act is uniquely alive with import. I do not think the case\\nis markedly different with those massed motions of mankind that\\nconstitute our government, our loves and hates, our rites and\\ncults, our business. It is their penetration by the discoveries and\\nthe adventures of intelligence, the hypotheses and the\\nconclusions of science, that confers upon them significance of contour\\nand of movement. No wonder that the eternal symbol of\\n  \\n                            \\nintelligence is light. But the value of light for man is the visibility,\\nthe splendor, and the variegated color it confers upon things that\\nare not light. So the significance of science is what it does for\\nthings that are not science. To speculate upon this significance, to\\nclarify it, to promote the educational intercourse so as to help\\nembody this significance in the actual practice of living will give\\nphilosophy quite enough to do.\\n  \\n                            \\nBrief Studies in Realism III [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 51, folder 16, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1912-13.]\\n»»\\nI\\nThe new realism agrees with a number of independent\\ntendencies in modern thought in turning away from the\\n\"category\" of things and attributes to that of elements and relations. I\\nhave no doubt of the advantages that have accrued to logic and\\nto various branches of philosophy from this change of attitude. It\\nbrings with it certain difficulties, however, and one of these\\ndifficulties I propose to specify here. On this basis, just what is the\\nstatus of a \"complex\"? A complex is, I take it, the equivalent of\\nthe old-fashioned \"thing.\" What is the warrant for accepting,\\nbelieving or knowing, the existence of any particular complex?\\nWhat is the warrant, put more objectively, for its individuality?\\nA tree or a rock, for example, is analyzed into a number of\\nrelations obtaining among a number of simples. When we have so\\nanalyzed it, is it possible to recover the tree or the rock at all?\\nThe difficulty is an old and familiar one in discussions. The\\nscientific resolution of the tree and the rock breaks down the seeming\\nspatial and temporal isolation of the thing—its sundering from\\nother things and its seeming self-centred reference. The tree as a\\ncomplex of related elements includes elements and relations of\\nsoil, air, light, etc. Nor does it seem possible to draw a definitive\\nline, theoretically, as to where these elements and relations leave\\noff. We seem caught in a network of a maelstrom. I think it probable that the difficulty I have in mind is exemplified on a large\\nscale in ^Leibniz. Compare his insistence, on one hand, upon the purely simple\\nwhich is, since simple, windowless, unaffected by anything else and incapable\\n\\nof affecting anything else and, on the other hand, upon universal harmony and\\nthe systematic character of the universe.\\nThe most familiar way of disposing of the difficulty is, of course, to refer the\\nindividualization and qualification of an indifferent and homogenouslyramify-ing\\nramifying material to the operation of \"consciousness\" in the act of apprehension.\\nThe realist, of course, is precluded from falling back upon this explanation.\\nBut it is somewhat striking that, up to the present, he has paid so littleatten-tion\\nattention to this particular phase of the subjectivism of rival theories of knowledge.\\nSo far, it would seem, he has been content to utilize the common sense belief in\\nthings in his theory of perceptual apprehension and the relation-elementcon-ception\\nconception in his theory of conceptual apprehension. But it is precisely theincom-patibility\\nincompatibility of these two theories that constitutes the difficulty with which we are\\ndealing. The existence of errors in detail or special illusions and hallucinations\\nis a small matter for the realist to cope with compared with the characteristic\\nindividualization, external and internal, of all subject-matter whatsoever save\\nthat resulting from conceptual analysis.\\nMore recently the practical and purposive element in \"consciousness\" has\\nbeen appealed to in explanation of the facts of individualization. Bergson with\\nhis theory of the parcelling, carving and sundering of a homogenous matter in\\nthe interests of action has of late given special prominence to this view. So far\\nas this theory interprets purpose and practice (or behavior) in terms ofcon-sciousness,\\nconsciousness, it is of course a mode of explanation as obnoxious to the newreal-ist\\nrealist as reference to the role of consciousness in apprehension. But criticism and\\nrejection of the theory only makes it the more incumbent upon him to supply a\\ngenuinely realistic theory of the nature of individualized things. And reference\\nto behavior at least has one advantage over the reference to the psychology of\\napprehension: Behavior is not merely psychical or a mere matter of\"conscious-ness\"\\n\"consciousness\" although intelligent behavior involves awareness and conscious aim: a\\ndifference which gives the \"behavior\" explanation as we shall see shortly adif-ferent\\ndifferent status from the \"apprehension\" explanation.\\n»1\\n  \\n                            \\nThe other difficulty is not ad hominem, but resides in the\\nmatter of the conception. As I look out of my window and see\\nhouses, trees, fountains, lampposts and bricks, grass and posts,\\nit is evident that some of the things seen—the manufactured\\narticles—owe their individualized existence to their being\\nembodiments of human ends. But admitting this, the ends so\\ninvolved are not mine; in seeing them I do not consciously share a\\nwill to make bricks and posts and girders and chimneys. Why\\nthen should they present this individuality in my perception? It\\nseems somewhat forced to say that there is something in my\\npresent conscious purpose or conscious intention which marks\\nthem off. Take a natural object—a stone. My use of it as one, in\\nthrowing it or building with it, is calculated to insist upon its\\nunity, and may well be the agency through which its\\nindividuality is experientially enforced. But it seems equally true to say\\n  \\n                            \\nthat I throw it or build with it because of the character it already\\npossesses. We do not pick out a handful of air to throw. Compare Dr. Boodin\\'s article on \"Do Things Exist?\" Journal of Philosophy,\\nPsychology and Scientific Methods, Jan. 4, 1912.\\n»2 In order\\nthat natural objects may serve as means for the execution of our\\npurposes they must have a character fitting them for that service.\\nEven though it be true that we apprehend things as externally\\nsundered and qualitatively identified only in so far as they are\\nemployed as means in a scheme of behavior—a doctrine which\\nseems to be much better psychology than the doctrine of fusion\\nof sensations with associated images—or even were it true that\\nultimately their individuality means that they are means in a\\nscheme of behavior, it is not the conscious intention to use them\\nas such which makes them means. They must be fitted on their\\nown account to be means. In short, a thoroughgoing pragmatism\\n(using this ambiguous term to denote reference to systems of\\nbehavior as the ultimate universe of philosophic discourse)\\ncannot play fast and loose with the notion that things are means; if\\nthey are, then that is what they are in their own right.\\nThe line of argument so far seems to be good realism. But it\\nonly intensifies, it does not relieve, the difficulty of reconciling\\na realistic philosophy of things with the doctrine that all\\nexistence, as well as all subsistence is an affair of elements and\\ntheir relations. The more thoroughgoing the realism, the more\\nimpossible does the latter scheme appear as a metaphysics of\\nexistence. The resolution of existence into related elements is\\nprecisely the theory which makes it necessary to regard concrete\\nnatural things and events as complexes which are subjectively\\ndetermined, parcellings out of reality due to \"consciousness,\"\\nwhether in conscious perceptions or in conscious intentions. The\\nfailure of some of the new realists to recognize this situation, is\\ndue I think to the fact that they have so largely taken their point\\nof departure from subsistents, from the realm of subsistence. In\\nthis realm, the difficulty does not present itself, because the\\nindividual or complex is a class, or a complex of\\ncorrespondences between classes. Where the entities dealt with are classes,\\nthe metaphysics of the thing in question—its own nature—is\\nwholly congruous with knowledge of it as a complex of related\\n  \\n                            \\nelements. But to call natural things and events classes, requires\\none to invoke a principle of conscious subjectivity (either in\\napprehension or use) for the arbitrary external sundering and\\ninherent qualification. If the existent tree or existent rock is a\\nclass, it is a class which involves, directly and indirectly, all the\\nelements and all the relations of the physical world; i.e., it is,\\nexistentially, that world. Nor can the difficulty be avoided by\\nsaying that \"consciousness\" operates merely to pick out or select a\\nportion of the whole. For the characteristic of the thing—the tree\\nor the stone—is that it does not present itself as merely a\\nquantitatively small part of a larger homogenous whole Compare my article on \"Perception and Organic Action,\" Journal ofPhi-losophy,\\nPhilosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, Nov. 21, 1912 [Middle Works\\n7:3-29].\\n»3—but as itself\\na thing, a qualitatively characterized individual. From the\\nstandpoint of a thoroughgoing metaphysic of related elements, this is\\nan illusion. To admit the possibility of \"consciousness\" being\\nresponsible for this illusion is, as already pointed out, to create a\\ndifficulty for a realistic theory of knowledge compared with\\nwhich the occasional occurrence of specific illusions is a matter\\nof slight moment. It is to cast aspersion upon the whole scope of\\nperceptual experience. In doing so it provides idealism with one\\nof its chief weapons, for, of course, it gives opportunity for\\nidealism to reply that in acknowledging that this individualization is\\nthe work of \"consciousness\" (whether intellectualistic or\\nvoluntaristic) and in holding that \"consciousness\" really constitutes\\nexistence it is rescuing real things from the limbo of illusion into\\nwhich realism has thrown them.\\nII\\nMy main purpose is fulfilled in calling attention to the\\ndifficulty. I shall supplement the discussion, however, with\\npropounding a rival hypothesis regarding the metaphysics of things,\\nasking the reader to note that the validity of this hypothesis is a\\nmatter wholly independent of the seriousness of the difficulty\\npointed out. My hypothesis may be all wrong, but the\\n  \\n                            \\nincompatibility of the metaphysics of related elements with the facts\\nregarding things remains.\\nWe are not held to a dilemma of a choice between the old\\nmetaphysics of substances and attributes and a universe of related\\nelements. In fact, the former is but a step in the direction of the\\nlatter, and the dialectic superiority of the latter is due to the fact\\nthat it makes explicit the logic already operative in the former.\\nThings may be integrated systems of behavior; centerings of\\nenergies. Such a view does justice to their external sundering and\\nintrinsic identification, while at the same time it does not commit\\nus to a rigid separation of things from each other. These centred\\nsystems of behavior interact; they have the maximum of\\nindividuality with reference to their centering, while they overlap and\\nvaguely pass into one another at the points of their maximum\\ninteraction with other things. From the standpoint of a realistic\\nempiricism, such combinations of strict individualization with\\nloose and varying peripheral demarcation are the commonest of\\naffairs, and their genuineness is not to be disputed on grounds of\\ndialectic incompatibility of centredness and complication with\\nextrinsic systems of action.\\nHuman behavior, intelligent or purposive behavior, would\\nthen be simply one system of integrated behavior—just the one,\\nnamely, which it is. There is nothing either inherently incredible\\nor objectionably \"subjectivistic\" The real meaning of the term subject would simply be such a characteristic\\nsystem of existent behavior.\\n»4 in holding that other systems\\nmight most completely exhibit their own characters as integrated\\nand differentiated factors within this system of behavior. Such a\\nposition would enable us to do justice to all the facts urged in\\nsupport of the conclusion that individuality is accentuated by (or\\neven in some sense connected with) such systems of intelligent\\nbehavior, without our being forced to conclude that a\\n\"consciousness\" or \"mind\" defined in antithesis to \"objects\" and the\\n\"world\" is responsible for this individuality. Individuality here and elsewhere is used purely denotatively to designate such\\nthings as a tree or a stone.\\n»5 One can say \"the\\nonly key we have to reality is what reality must be taken as in the\\nprogressive realization of the purposes of human nature.\" Boodin, article cited, p. 14.\\n»6\\n  \\n                            \\nIII\\nIt will be urged, I suppose, that such a view comes into\\nconflict with the findings of science which treats objects, through\\nits mathematical analysis, as complexes of related elements; as\\npropositions, or the subject-matter of propositions. It is not open\\nto a realist, however, to urge this objection. Apart from the point\\n(belonging to the strategy, so to say, of philosophic \\'isms) that in\\nthe past this view has always been an open door to objective\\nidealisms, it involves that wholesale discrediting of perception\\nwhich has already been indicated. Dialectically, it involves\\npeculiar difficulties of its own, which I will not go into here further\\nthan to say that they are of the nature of the Platonic difficulties\\nregarding the presence of the universal in the particular, the\\ncombination of particular and universal of essence and existence, to\\nmake physical things: How can elements and relations drawn\\nrespectively from the realms of existence and subsistence unite\\nin constituting specific things and events? But, supposing all\\nthese difficulties got over, it surely is not open to a realism which\\nholds that both science and perception \"know\" things directly as\\nthey are to employ science to annul the metaphysical validity of\\n^perception with its presence of individualized things.\\nAccordingly I advance, with equal summariness, another\\nhypothesis. Science is concerned with the interaction of these\\nindividualized systems of behavior with one another; it is not\\nconcerned with their existence or structure as such. It is always\\nabout them, and about them with respect to their mutual\\ninfluences, in furthering or retarding one another. Being concerned,\\ntherefore, wholly with relativities, not with individualities, it\\nnaturally falls into the schema of elements and relations, and\\nviews things simply from the standpoint of correspondences and\\nsubstitutions. This is not a deformation of the actual existences.\\nIt only becomes such when it is presented as an exhaustive\\nmetaphysics of existence.\\nAnd, to carry the hypothesis one point further into the\\nspeculative, since we as living beings are primarily concerned with\\nthe human system of behaviors individual and social, in which\\nnatural things and events enter and upon whose cooperation the\\nsuccess of the human systems depends, it is wholly natural that\\nscience should be from the standpoint of and in the interests of\\n  \\n                            \\nthe successful regulation of the human systems. That is to say, it\\nis concerned with the mutual interactions of the physical systems\\nof action with respect ultimately to their efficiency as factors in\\nthe human career.\\nI have presented these points simply as hypotheses and in\\nhighly summary form. They seem to me, however, to be in\\naccord with the evidence of the case, and to present the only\\nhopeful method of doing justice both to what are ordinarily called\\n\"objective\" and \"subjective\" considerations—the only method\\nwhich does not give a power and scope to the socalled subjective\\nwhich, in the very midst of realistic systems, always calls out an\\nidealistic movement.\\n  \\n                            \\nA Working Method in Social Psychology [Typescript in the John Dewey Manuscript Collection, Rare Book and Manuscript\\nLibrary, Butler Library, Columbia University, New York, N.Y., ca. 1920(?).]\\n»»\\nA moderate degree of acquaintance with recent\\nsociological literature shows that at least five different sets of problems\\nhave been discussed having supposedly some connection with the\\ntopic of social psychology. To a certain extent these different\\nproblems have been discussed by different writers, with quite\\ndistinct and independent aims. To a certain extent, however, they\\nhave overlapped even in the same writer; and there has been a\\nmore or less unconscious transition from one group to another,\\nwith resulting confusion. As preliminary to an attempt to delimit\\nthe field of social psychology, and to plot a chart of its activities,\\nit may be well to discriminate somewhat precisely these different\\ntypes of discussion.\\nThe first takes well-known social phenomena and employs\\npsychological considerations whenever these are found likely to\\nassist in the interpretation of the facts in question. It may be a\\nquestion of language; it may be a matter of myth, or magic, or\\nreligious cult; it may be a matter of blood feud, or of exogamous\\nmarriage; it may be a question of the character of property\\nownership or political authority. The investigator dealing with\\nthe problem is led to the conclusion that a certain phase or bulk\\nof the facts, greater or less as the case may be in different\\ninstances, has a distinctively psychological origin. Naturally he\\nthen draws upon the best psychological theory accessible to him.\\nHere is psychology general or analytic psychology, frankly\\nrecognized as such, and employed to assist in the statement,\\nexplanation and classification of sociological facts.\\nIn the second place, we have attempts to account for and deal\\nwith mental phenomena which are experienced in common by a\\n  \\n                            \\nconsiderable number of people. An extreme case is the crowd\\nor mob spirit. Another instance (if one is permitted to assume\\nagainst certain French writers that this is another instance and\\nnot just a case of mob spirit) is public opinion viewed as a de\\nfacto matter: as simply meaning that a very considerable number\\nof people hold the same view so as to be led to common action.\\nTo many writers the psychology (generally that of sympathy,\\ncontagion, imitation or communication) which accounts for the\\ncommon content of belief and purpose in different persons in a\\ngiven social group, is social psychology. The existence, nature\\nand mechanism of an identical or homogeneous content is the\\nproblem of social psychology.\\nIn the third place, there is consciousness of common interests,\\npurposes: such an awareness of the common weal or woe as\\nmaterially modifies the action of the individual in whom the\\nconsciousness is found. Facts belonging to this group, while\\noccasionally confused with those spoken of under the second\\nhead, are readily enough marked off. There is an obvious\\ndistinction between simply holding the same idea that another\\nholds (whether consciously or not), and employing reference to\\nsocial well-being as the standard by which one consciously tries\\nthe ideas which one accepts, and the aims that one sets up. I\\nmay believe with a number of my fellows that \"protection\" is\\nabsolutely indispensable, or that a certain method of baptism is\\nnecessary. This is a matter of what I call the common content.\\nBut a reformer may be practically the only individual who, at a\\ngiven time, accepts a given principle and yet his state of mind be\\nthoroughly socialized because he has been brought to his belief\\nby considerations of social well-being. In this sense, \\'social\\nconsciousness\\' takes on inevitably something of an ethical meaning;\\nsocial consciousness stands more or less over against individual\\nconsciousness, the latter having a somewhat distinctly egoistic or\\nselfish reference. Some writers have proceeded more or less\\ndefinitely on the basis that the problem of social psychology is that\\nof thoughts and feelings having as their object or focus of\\nattachment general social welfare.\\nFourthly, the influence exercised upon a given individual by\\nthe social medium in which he lives has attracted the attention of\\nsome investigators. They have endeavored to account for a given\\nsystem of individual opinions and purposes in terms of the social\\n  \\n                            \\nmedium in which it forms. They have occupied themselves with\\nthe mechanism by which the individual\\'s feelings, judgments and\\nintentions have been socially elaborated. There is clearly some\\npoint of connection here with the second set of problems in so\\nfar as these structures involve a common content, and I think\\nsome writers have passed quite unconsciously from one sphere to\\nthe other—to the detriment of their work. For the problem in the\\ntwo cases is different. In one it is the existence of the common\\ncontent as common that defines the investigation; in the other, it\\nis a matter of explaining under what social influences a given\\nindividual A B, or a given set of individuals M N, come to hold\\ncertain concrete ideas—and habits—which in their totality\\nconstitute such and such a type of character. Why and how does the\\ncity dweller differ from the country resident? What makes the\\ndifference in the type of interests and ideals of the inhabitant of\\nMassachusetts and South Carolina? Under what social\\nconditions is this man a burglar and the other man a speculator,\\nand the third a physician? While these are questions about\\nindividuals, or groups of individuals, they are clearly social\\nquestions—questions of describing and explaining certain social\\ntypes and figures. It is the individual as a social individual that is\\nunder consideration—not the individual in his psychical\\nmechanism, but as a concrete personality with a concrete equipment of\\nhabits, plans and ideas. Undoubtedly psychology may be useful\\nas a method in solving this type of problem; but some writers\\nhave apparently been misled (because it is an individual that is\\nunder examination) into thinking that the results obtained are of\\na distinctively psychological character.\\nFinally there is the delicate and subtle matter of explaining the\\nmental process as such in terms of that social situation which\\nstimulates and motivates it. For example, the sensation as a\\npsychical event, as distinct from a given content or quality, would\\nhardly come within the purview of social psychology in any of\\nthe four previous types of problems. It belongs to social\\npsychology under this fifth caption, in so far as it can be shown that a\\nsocial medium evokes and determines the sensation considered\\nas a type of mental attitude or operation. The actual structure of\\nsense-perceptions that make up the working equipment of a\\nsavage, or a civilized American of the 19th century, belong to the\\nfourth class of problems; but the keenness and alertness of sense\\n  \\n                            \\nperception in the savage, the particular quality of the act of\\nperceiving, the role it plays in the whole psychical life, is a different\\nsort of question. Scientifically we can abstract from the actual\\nexperience the aspect of content, and that of mode or form.\\nHence if confusion is easy between this point of view and that of\\nour fourth head, discrimination is also easy. There it was a\\nquestion of explaining certain concrete and definite mental contents\\nthrough reference to other contents of the same sort already\\nexisting. Here it is not a question of any particular idea, plan or\\nhabit, but rather of the typical psychical attitudes and operations\\ninvolved in them. It is not a question of explaining them by\\nreference to similar attitudes on the part of other individuals, but\\nrather by connecting them with the structure and movement\\nof the social situation in which they appear. It is one thing to\\naccount for the acceptance by a given Chinaman of a certain set\\nof traditional ideas; it is another to account for the Chinaman\\'s\\nhabit of relying upon authority in memorized forms, instead of\\nemploying initiative in thinking out things for himself. In\\nproblems of the fourth sort, we are interested in the statement of the\\nbehavior and ideas current in a given individual or group of\\nindividuals, essentially a social matter. Under the present head, we\\nare concerned with the existence of a certain psychical type, a\\ncertain mental pattern, form or schema—and this is essentially a\\npsychological matter. My article on the \"Interpretation of Savage Mind\" in the Psychological\\nReview for May 1902 [Middle Works 2:39-52], may be referred to asex-emplifying\\nexemplifying in more detail what is meant by a mental type or pattern.\\n»1\\nIf we now contrast the first with the fifth of our sets of\\nproblems, we shall find that we have reversed our point of view. In the\\nfirst, the point was to explain certain social phenomena through\\nreference to well established principles of psychology—such as\\nthe association of ideas, the formation of visual images, the value\\nof symbols in directing intellectual processes, etc. Under our last\\nhead, the problems that come up have to do with explaining\\npsychical processes by reference to social situations. The distinction\\nbetween these two extremes is then sufficiently well marked. The\\ndirect interest in the first case is sociological; in the last case, it is\\nimmediately psychological. But what with the three intervening\\nterms? How shall we group them?\\n  \\n                            \\nThese intervening terms, be it recalled, (1) the existence of\\ncommon contents; (2) the existence of conscious social\\nreferences in the ideas and feelings entertained by an individual and\\nthe acts performed by him; (3) and the complex system of ideas\\nand modes of behavior current in an individual, or a group of\\nindividuals, so far as these require to be socially explained.\\nWithout surrendering for a moment the necessity of clear\\ndistinction between these various groups of problems in order to\\nprevent confusion, I yet hold that all these affairs fall into line as\\nphases of a common investigation which from the\\nmethodological standpoint may well be termed social psychology. To show\\nhow and why this is true may afford a fitting introduction to\\nthe discussion of the working standpoint in method of such a\\nscience.\\nIn the first place I shall point out that the problem of certain\\ninstitutional forms of religion, politics, economics, etc., is\\npractically identical with the problem of the actual beliefs and\\ncustoms current in a given group of individuals in so far as an\\nexplanation of either is attempted, which involves the use of\\npsychological conceptions; and accordingly the first and the fourth\\nof our original heads resolve themselves naturally into each\\nother. In both we have ultimately the same facts. In one case the\\nfacts are considered more institutionally and objectively; in the\\nother case more personally and from within. It is clearly the same\\nreality we are concerned with whether we investigate the body of\\nmyths obtained in a given Indian tribe, or consider the persons of\\nthat tribe in so far as they accept and are influenced by these\\nlegends. In the first case we give for the time being a sort of\\ntentative existence to the myths, neglecting for scientific convenience\\nthe fact that after all they are only part of the intellectual and\\nemotional equipment of that group of individuals who believe in\\nthem and report them. In the latter case we take account of the\\nmyths as actually phenomena of the experience, religious,\\naesthetic, scientific, etc., of this group. The latter point of view\\nsimply takes the facts at a somewhat lower level: it recognizes\\nthat \"institutions\" have no existence except in terms of the\\nconcrete interests, emotions, and systems of conduct that prevail in a\\ngiven set of associated persons. As a matter of scientific division\\nof labor, the first point of view is that appropriate to the\\nphilologist when he occupies himself with the linguistic phenomena of a\\n  \\n                            \\ngiven group; to the comparative religionist when he is\\ninvestigating myths, rites, cults, dogmas, etc.; to the student of\\njurisprudence concerned with the system of rights and duties that obtain\\nin a community—in short to the specialist, preoccupied with\\ndescription and explanation of a given set of social phenomena.\\nThe other point of view, that which refers the institutional phase\\nto the concrete habits of action and opinion that are found\\namong the individuals of a group, then attempting to explain\\nthem by reference to the social medium, is the attitude\\nappropriate to the general ethnologist. He must accept his particular\\nphase largely at the hands of the specialist; he is concerned\\nthereafter with them in their interrelations as parts—more or less\\nloosely bound together—of the common and more\\ncomprehensive body of experience.\\nIf this virtual identity of subject matter be borne in mind, it\\nshould also be clear that the problem of the conscious reference\\nto social well-being as an operating motive in determining the\\nindividual\\'s opinions and behavior, is simply a more special\\ninstance of a phase of personal equipment which requires social\\nexplanation. It is an instance in which the social aspect is so\\nobvious and striking as to have misled some into thinking that\\nhere alone is to be found a distinctively social fact. In truth what\\nwe have here is an additional exponent of sociability. While in\\ndetail it affords one of the most interesting and important of all\\nthe sociological problems, in principle it stands upon the same\\nlevel with any way of thinking or acting which is socially\\ngenerated and conditioned. The prevalence of a certain religious cult\\nin a given group of individuals would clearly be a fact falling\\nunder our fourth type of problems. We may find, however, as one\\nphenomenon among others in the operation of that cult, that\\nit regards certain other ideas and practices as merely private\\nor personal and accordingly reprobates them and tries to\\nsuppress them—this happens for instance in some communities\\nwith magic, which in others is tolerated as a legitimate part of the\\nsocially accepted religious phenomena. In the latter case the\\nreligious facts requiring explanation are loaded with an additional\\nelement of significance—that of being felt and conceived as\\ncommon or distinctly associational in kind. The nature of this\\nannexing of conscious social reference; the origin of the distinction\\nbetween the public and private significance; the bearing of the\\n  \\n                            \\ndistinction between public and private, upon not only the details\\nof the cult itself, but upon say other social phenomena, domestic\\nand political:—all these are points needing investigation. But\\nafter all they only supply additional characteristic qualities of\\nthose personal experiences and equipments which need\\nexplanation in the light of their social context. An institution is social\\nbecause of its working, because of its effects, what it actually\\naccomplishes. Explicit consciousness of the importance and\\nnecessity of these results reacts of course into the institution itself;\\nit calls out a new set of emotions and ideas which in turn modify\\nthe practical workings and the actual results. Yet the institution\\nin order to acquire social value does not wait upon the rise of\\nsuch distinctive conscious reference. The distinction is quite\\nanalogous to that of a spectator who is aesthetically enjoying a\\npicture, as compared with another spectator who in addition to his\\nenjoyment is reflexly conscious of its aesthetic origin and nature;\\nand who accordingly to a greater or less degree controls his\\nattitude of appreciation by reference to aesthetic norms. What we\\nhave here is simply an additional complication which supervenes\\nwithin the aesthetic fact—not any radical difference of kind.\\nSo far as method is concerned, the significance of that\\nparticular type of social phenomena which is accompanied by specific\\nideas and emotions, serving as conscious indices of social value,\\nis two-fold. In the first place (as already indicated) it marks\\ntransition from the social sphere into the socio-ethical. In the second\\nplace it suggests and almost compels express recourse to the\\npsychological point of view. As stated at the outset, the sociologist\\nmay go to psychology at any point where he finds psychological\\ndata and methods likely to be of use to him. When he is dealing\\nwith ^[missing text] where the social quality [missing text] simply\\non the part of the investigator, but on the part of those actually\\nexperiencing them), psychology becomes of almost inevitable\\nresort.\\n  \\n                            \\nProblems of Contemporary Philosophy: The Problem of Experience [Lecture at Rand School of Social Science, New York, N.Y., 8 March 1933.\\nMicrofilm of stenographic report in Tamiment Collection 13, Reel 45, #121,\\nNew York University, New York, N.Y.]\\n»»\\nFriends, fellow students: When I arranged with ^Mr.\\nBohn last Spring to give these three lectures on philosophical\\nsubjects, ^I didn\\'t realize that there would be as much need to be\\nphilosophical when the lectures began as there is now. However,\\nphilosophy proper has perhaps got a good ways away from the\\nconception of being philosophical, which was philosophy taught\\nhow to grin and bear it and understand the trouble of life, an\\nidea, I suppose, that came down from the old stoic philosophy.\\nIn speaking of the problem of experience the first question I\\nwant to raise is what difference does it actually make whether\\none holds a philosophy based on experience, one holds the\\ntheory of knowledge and of conduct, personal conduct, social\\nrelationship based on experience, or whether one holds a theory of\\nthese things based on something else beside experience? What is\\nthe human bearing of the issue itself? Does it make, would it\\nmake, any actual difference in the conduct of life if people in\\ngeneral held to a philosophy of experience or they held to some\\nother philosophy? I\\'m ready to discuss this before I take up\\nanything about what experience itself is.\\nNow the first point that I want to make is that there is a very\\npractical human bearing in this issue as to whether one has a\\nphilosophy based on experience or one based on something\\nelse. And the first aspect of the difference that it makes may be\\nbrought out, indicated, by a reference to the English thinker John\\nLocke, who wrote in the latter part of the seventeenth century.\\nHis chief work was published right after the English revolution,\\nwhen the Stuarts were finally overthrown in 1688. He was one of\\n  \\n                            \\nthe first of the modern thinkers to insist that all our beliefs,\\nscientific and moral, political, should be based on experience. Now he\\ncontrasted his philosophy of experience with another\\nphilosophy that had a good deal of vogue. A good many adherents at his\\ntime had believed in innate ideas, principles, standards, ideals,\\nwhich were not acquired through the processes of living through\\nour experience, but that the mind brought with it, which were\\ntherefore deeper than all experience, more fundamental, more\\nsure, more commanding than any idea, any belief or principle\\nthat is derived from our actual experience. Now he gave various\\nreasons attacking the theory of these innate ideas, which\\nincluded all kinds of moral, intellectual, philosophical principles,\\nsome of which were purely theoretical. But the practical one, the\\none that indicates the bearing of philosophy of experience upon\\nother things, was the statement that if the people believed in\\nthese innate ideas, then all kinds of prejudices, notions which\\nwere instilled early in life, so early that people didn\\'t know later\\nhow they came by them, would seem to have this sanction of\\nbeing inherent in the mind and therefore would not be subject to\\nany examination or criticism. ^He then went on to say that it\\nwould give a man or a class of men very great authority, very\\ngreat influence and very great power over the beliefs and conduct\\nof other people . . . or that group were the ones to instill in the\\nminds of people these beliefs and these standards; standards,\\nprinciples, which could not possibly be examined because they\\ncame from such a higher source that they were exempt from all\\nexamination in the light of our actual experience.\\nNow he struck there a very real note which one finds running\\nthrough the history of thought, especially for reasons I\\'ll speak of\\nlater, the history of modern thought, about why this problem\\nof experience, its issue of having a philosophy based on\\nexperience or on something else, is important. In those books that John\\nMorley wrote about the great French thinkers of the eighteenth\\ncentury, one on Rousseau, another on Voltaire, another on\\nDiderot and the Encyclopedists, Morley points out and history\\njustifies his remark that these empirical thinkers that did hold\\nto experience as the source and the authority for our beliefs, had\\nbeen very uniformly on the liberal side of political and social\\nquestions, and those that held to innate ideas, a priori principles,\\nthose which don\\'t come to us through actual experience, had\\n  \\n                            \\nbeen with practical uniformity on the conservative side,\\nreactionary side in all questions of government.\\nNow for reasons that I think are particularly obvious and will\\nstate a little better later, I just want now to call your attention to\\nthat fact—that it has been that the belief in standards or ideas\\nwhich are not derived from experience, therefore which can\\'t be\\ntested by experience, has been all through the ages a very\\npowerful instrument, one may say a very powerful weapon, in the\\nhands of those people who are in power, who had social control\\nin their hands; that, in effect, it was comparatively easy for them\\nto say that the standards and principles which are represented in\\nthe existing political and social order, existing type of\\ngovernment, are eternal in their nature; that they are necessary and\\nuniversal and therefore not to be questioned. John Locke, in one\\nof his essays, made perhaps a statement that is rather extreme\\nwhen he said that our minds like our churches and temples have\\nin them certain figures by which they are ultimately governed,\\nthat final authority, the final source of man\\'s actions, their ideas,\\ntheir ideals; and that therefore to be able to dictate to others\\nthrough the medium of ideas that are superior to experience, that\\ncome from some source higher than experience, is ultimately\\nreally the power to regulate man\\'s action.\\nNow that perhaps is a little extreme. Man\\'s conduct governs\\nperhaps, governs relatively more by habit and less by simple\\nideas than Locke thought, but there is enough truth in that we\\nare controlled enough by our thought and ideas, certainly, that\\n^Locke was right in saying it\\'s no mean power and authority that\\na person has if he can get into the minds of other people that the\\nideas and principles which he represents come from a superior\\nsource.\\nPutting it a little somewhat the other way, the fundamental\\nauthorities through church, religious organizations, have always\\nheld that their fundamental ideas and standards were essentially\\nsupernatural, that they were superempirical, and therefore men\\nsimply had to bow before those principles and not just their\\npractical judgment or their convictions that were derived from\\nan experience with the world, with one another, to bring to bear\\non those ideas. That is the most specific issue which is at stake in\\nthis matter of a philosophy of experience versus some other kind\\nof philosophy, technically, generally, transcendental philosophy,\\n  \\n                            \\nthat is, a philosophy coming from some source that transcends\\nor goes beyond anything in actual experience.\\nThere is another reason which is not so definite but which is\\nequally important, perhaps in the long run more and more. That\\nis, these other philosophies, which taking human history as a\\nwhole have had more influence in controlling people\\'s beliefs and\\ntheir institutions and conduct than ideas based on philosophy of\\nexperience, have led people to, well, to depreciate experience, to\\nmake light of the actual possibilities of experience. I want to\\nbreak that sentence up into two parts. One is that this issue is\\nimportant, I repeat, because the mass of people through the\\nwhole of recorded history have not accepted actually in their\\nconduct a philosophy of experience. They have accepted\\nstandards and ideas which cling to, claim to have, an authority and a\\nsanction beyond experience. And the other point is, I repeat, that\\nbecause of that they have not esteemed actual experience very\\nhighly, or put it the other way around, they have put their chief\\nattention and attached chief importance to things that cling to,\\nbelong to, realms that were beyond our actual experience here\\non earth.\\nThe reference I made a moment ago to the influence, power, of\\nsupernatural ideas, that is, ideals claiming supernatural\\nauthority, standards of criteria to measure values by, claims to have\\ncome from revelation, from a source higher than experience,\\ntherefore possesses great thought . . . had we all know this great\\ninfluence upon man all through history. Now the effect of that I\\nrepeat is to have made people think that those values and those\\nstandards were of greater importance than anything in\\nexperience; and in my judgment one reason that our actual experience\\nhasn\\'t been any better than it has, the fact that actual human\\nexperience has been a good deal of a mess and human experience\\nis still a good deal of a mess, is that so many people have been\\ntaught to believe and have come to believe that the remedy is to\\nbe found outside of experience, that there isn\\'t much use in\\nrelying on experience anyway, that experience is incapable of giving\\nus any great values to work by, that experience isn\\'t capable of\\nsetting up methods which will really guide people effectually.\\nI don\\'t want to dwell unduly, but I do like to call your\\nattention to this point; the very great probability that one reason that\\nthe human race, humanity, hasn\\'t got out of experience more\\n  \\n                            \\nthan it has is this fact that it has been taught to look elsewhere\\nfor supreme values and for supreme guidance to conduct. Of\\ncourse a greater and greater number of people are questioning\\nthat point of view today, and don\\'t regard it as very modern, or\\nuptodate, to hold it. But mankind as a whole, I repeat, through\\nthe course of history has been habituated to that; and so there\\nhas been a disparagement, this lack of esteem for experience and\\nthis lack of serious thought and attention to what we might make\\nout of experience, if we took that experience as our only ultimate\\nguide to action. Those are the two great reasons why this\\nproblem of philosophy of experience is of human significance,\\ngenerally significant and not merely of technical philosophical\\nsignificance and importance.\\nNow coming to the history of philosophic thought itself I\\nwould say that there have been three main stages in the\\ndevelopment of thought regarding the matter of experience. The first of\\nthose notions about experience comes to us from the great\\nphilosophies of ancient Greece, of ancient Athens: great\\nphilosophers of the fifth century before the Christian era, Plato, and his\\npupil, but not exactly disciple, Aristotle. The philosophical\\ntradition of something higher than experience, something having a\\ngreater authority than anything in experience, was formulated (I\\ndon\\'t say originated, but formulated) in a systematic way and\\nwas justified by argument in this period of Greek thought and\\nthen found its way into the whole tradition of the western world.\\nWe must remember that the philosophy which was dominant\\nin Europe for centuries and still influences that of the Catholic\\nchurch was based, as far as possible, upon the teachings of\\nAristotle. And so not just through professors\\' teachings and\\nwritings, and universities, but through the church itself for centuries\\nthrough the Middle Ages and a period preceding it, ideals became\\na part of the common intellectual stock of trade of the European\\nworld without any conscious knowledge of these great\\nphilosophers themselves and to . . . America\\'s(?) . . . certain extent also\\nis true of Jewish philosophy of this period, combination of\\nAristotle or Plato with the Old Testament, much as the Christian\\ntheologians, Catholic theologians, made one between Christians\\nand these old people.\\nNow we come to the particular point. They identified\\nexperience and the knowledge that comes from experience essentially\\n  \\n                            \\nwith custom, with habit, with things that have been found to\\nwork pretty well and therefore are adopted because they become\\nusual and customary. Also, people did not know any cause or\\nreason for it. When it is said today that up to very recently\\nmedicine was a purely empirical science and not a rational science or\\nthat the architects and masons of the Middle Ages built their\\ncathedrals empirically and not on the basis of scientific\\nengineering knowledge, it is still that meaning of experience that we have\\nin mind. It is illustrated in an anecdote of ^James\\' Psychology, of a\\npassenger in a railroad train. When the railroad car still had\\nstoves that burned wood, one in each car (anybody here except\\nmyself old enough to remember the kind of passenger cars?), a\\npassenger complained when the train was stopped, of the stove\\nsmoking and filling the car with disagreeable fumes and the\\nbrakeman said, \"Well, it will stop just as soon as the train\\nstarts,\" and the other person asked, \"Why will it?\" \"It always\\ndoes.\" Now that is empirical knowledge in the sense in which the\\nGreek philosophers formulated experience and empiricism.\\nDoctors used certain remedies just as they use quinine for malaria.\\nThey didn\\'t know why it worked but it did, just like the\\nbrakeman and his stove. It always has, almost always, and so it will\\nprobably cure you. Or the average carpenter will build his house.\\nActually of course he had to obey certain laws of physics,\\ngravitation, of strength of material, laws of stress and strain, and so\\non, but after all he didn\\'t know because he understood those\\nprinciples and causes. People by cut and tried methods, trial and\\naccident and success and failure, had found that they built up\\ncertain habits and on the whole those habits gave the desired\\nresult. Well, that was experience there, and these great Greek\\nphilosophers made a sharp contrast between that and sciences.\\nScience was higher than experience because it involved a\\nknowledge of the causes and the reasons which brought about\\nthese things. Now you know the Greeks originated our scientific\\nmathematics, especially geometry, and up to very recently the\\ngeometry we still study in high schools was called Euclidean\\nfrom this old Greek geometer, who lived in just about this period\\nwhen Plato was writing his philosophy. And so they held\\ngeometry up as a rational science that they said doesn\\'t depend upon\\ncustom or upon experience at all. There are certain axiomatic\\neternal truths—we still call these axioms—that meant self-\\n  \\n                            \\nevident truths, not realized from experience. Experience could only\\ngive us these principles which are generally true. They are not\\nnecessarily so, since truth, true science, like geometry, appealed\\npurely to reason and dealt with the rational principles which\\nwere above and beyond experience. Now so far as Greek\\nexperience was concerned, there was a lot of truth in that distinction.\\nTheir experience, practical experience, was based on custom,\\nthat is, habit; that is, on tradition that had been worked out\\nthrough the process of slow selection and passed on from one\\nindividual to another and therefore it was quite natural, one\\nmight almost say quite proper, that they cannot imagine any\\nkind of experience which would ascertain the real causes for\\nthings and the real reasons for things.\\nThe result was that they had two levels: the higher level of\\nrational science which gave us eternal universal necessary truths\\nwhich were found in science and which ought to govern man\\'s\\nmoral behavior, ought to control human institutions; and the\\nlower level of the experience of the average man, of the carpenter\\nand the shoemaker and even the physician and all the other\\npeople who just did the best they could, utilizing the customs\\nand ideas, beliefs, that had been handed down to them from the\\npast. Now to anticipate a later point, they could not imagine\\nthese truths of science; not only couldn\\'t they imagine them\\nbeing generated or produced by experience, but they couldn\\'t\\nimagine them being embodied in experience. They thought of\\nthese two levels as necessarily forever separate and isolated from\\neach other. And to make a jump, to save time, down to the\\nmodern period, what we know now is that the understanding of\\nscientific causes, of the principles of things, is actually capable of\\nbeing embodied in everyday experience. We know that, because\\nwe have a technology or the technique by which these truths of\\nscience, that is to say, understanding of cause, relationship of\\ncause and effect, are actually applied. I don\\'t see how anybody\\ncould have ever invented the electric light merely by following\\nexperience in the general sense of experience, that is, the more or\\nless accidental occurrences, habits and customs of the past. But\\nwhen men developed a scientific understanding of the laws of\\nelectricity, of cause and effect in relation to light and electricity,\\nthe causal laws of the conservation and transformation of energy\\n(one form of energy is transformable into another), then it was\\n  \\n                            \\npossible for people to deliberately invent such things as electric\\nlights, the telephone and all of the other inventions which now\\nare a part of the daily experience of everybody. The Greeks had\\nno theory or system of invention and of technology and therefore\\nthey could not close the gap between these, between these\\nscientific truths and the average daily experience of the mass of people\\nin ordinary life. We have got this great ^system of controlled\\nmethods, techniques of invention, which enable us to live ordinary\\nexperience, live higher than the plane of habit and custom that\\naccidentally had been hit upon in the past. That is the reason that\\nexperience can mean something today very different from what it\\nmeant to the Greeks.\\nNow there is another very important conclusion from that,\\nwhich I would like to point out, though I don\\'t stop to dwell\\nupon it now. That is that while we have acted on this fact that it\\nis possible to carry over scientific truths, thoughts and principles,\\nthe understanding of causal relations into experience (everyday\\nexperience in the physical field and illustrated by the electric\\nlight, the telephone, the dynamo, the internal combustion engine\\non the motor car, even the steam engine on the locomotive), we\\nhave not as yet found any way of discovering, or at least of\\napplying when discovered, the social truths and principles making\\nthem carry over into everyday experience the way in which\\nscientific truths in the physical field, the field of the natural sciences,\\nare brought down through suitable technology into everyday\\nhuman experience in this other field.\\nWell, there came on Greek civilization, which was more or less\\nswamped, and covered a good many centuries of history. All\\nnorthern Europe you know, outside of the Mediterranean Basin,\\nwas inhabited by barbarians. Finally these barbarians overran\\nRome, Italy and the higher culture of Greece which was already\\nsome good deal diluted in the Roman Empire. It was still further\\nswamped. And yet it remained as a higher culture, and it was\\npreserved by the church and by other authorities and was looked\\nup to by the barbarians throughout Europe, and rightly so, as\\nbeing something higher than their own experience. Now that is a\\nvery significant fact in human history, that here you have\\nbarbarians, not savages, but people on a barbarian level of civilization,\\ncontrasted with this very much higher grade of civilization of\\nGreece and Rome, superimposing upon the people through the\\n  \\n                            \\nauthority of the church and the state these principles which did\\nnot grow out of the actual experience of people. So the whole\\nEuropean situation came to be of a kind which confirmed this\\nidea of a higher set of truths and standards beyond the\\nexperience of everyday life. They had, one might say, if they are going\\nto become really civilized—regain the level which had belonged\\nto the earlier civilization—they had to accept these things\\ncoming to them from the outside, something they had to struggle to\\nlive up to, and the authority of the church and the state naturally\\ntook advantage of that situation. Well finally Europe became\\nrelatively civilized.\\nNow we have a period that is known as the revival of learning,\\nthe Renaissance, when the leaders of European civilization began\\nagain to think for themselves and to speak their own experience\\nand not merely look back to that of Palestine in religion and\\nGreece in science and philosophy, and of Rome in law,\\ngovernment and politics, as something higher and superior to anything\\nin their own experience. And then you\\'ve got a revival again of\\nthe appeal to experience as the ultimate source of anything that is\\nentitled to belief as the ultimate authority in all matters of\\nconduct, personal and social.\\n^Francis Bacon stands out, as a contemporary of the\\nElizabethan age, as a great thinker, because he is a typical\\nrepresentative of this new appeal. He said we are the real ancients. The\\npeople we call the ancients and that we have been looking up to,\\nthey really were the youths of civilization; we are older than they\\nare because we have all of the intervening experience and wisdom,\\nand with a certain independence we should find our own\\nmethods for discovering truths instead of taking them on the\\nauthority of the past, something outside our experience.\\nAnd then we come to Locke, to whom I referred earlier, and\\nhis point of view, and there I want to go back just for a moment\\nto this point of his liberalism. He had more influence on Thomas\\nJefferson and people that drew up our Declaration of\\nIndependence and so on, than any other individual, and in a way the\\ndemocratic principles as they evolved in this country and later in\\nFrance were very closely connected with the later development of\\nthis appeal to experience and the ultimate thing. Every individual\\nhas experience. He may not have this higher reason; he doesn\\'t\\nhave these innate ideas—no one has that—but every individual\\n  \\n                            \\nhas experience and, if he is normal, certain good sense,\\njudgment, to utilize that experience, and therefore we ought to build\\nour social institutions on appeal to the experience of the average\\nperson and his needs, requirements, instead of upon this\\nauthority supposedly coming from outside superior powers.\\nHe also is greatly interested in the principle of toleration. You\\nknow the seventeenth century was the century of great religious\\nwars, of clashes there in England that had been the wars—\\nconflict between the Catholics and the Protestants; and then the\\nProtestants got into civil wars among themselves, more or less\\nChurch of England on one side, and Presbyterians, representing\\nanother policy in government and not merely in religion; and\\nthen the Independent Baptists, Congregationalists, Puritans, and\\nso on, and Cromwell having still another; and these people\\nquarreling and actually fighting among themselves. And so Locke\\nsaid, now a great deal of this comes because people are a great\\ndeal bothered and troubled about things beyond experience. You\\ncan\\'t prove anything of these things; you can\\'t disprove, because\\nthey are outside of experience. If people will stick to experience\\nand the lessons of experience they will stick to things which are\\npossible for them to verify and prove and they will have very\\nmuch more tolerance and respect for each other. In other words,\\nin fact he said the civil wars and troubles come because people\\nare asserting on supposed authority higher than experience these\\nthings which lie outside of the scope of experience. And the\\npeople will come down to periods and places; they will have a\\ntoleration, regard for each other which will make them respect\\neach other and save them from constant friction, antagonism\\nwith each other.\\nNow the French in the eighteenth century took up this\\nconception of Locke, that all our knowledge and ideas come from\\nexperience, and they took certain things that he said and\\ncarried them much further than he did, the French being a more\\nlogical people, more given to following principles to their logical\\nconclusion. And Locke said the mind is a piece of blank paper\\nand experience writes everything on it through contact with the\\noutside, what we call the environment; some of these French\\nthinkers said, if that is so, then education can be omnipotent. If\\nthe mind of every individual at birth is a blank and if all\\nbeliefs, standards, are built through experience, then by controlling\\n  \\n                            \\nthe environment, especially the social environment, the political\\nenvironment, you can impress any kind of beliefs and develop\\nany kind of conduct you please and thus remake the world. And\\nthis idea, the possibility of indefinite progress, the idea of the\\nperfectability of man, of people, would get away from ignorance\\nand superstition and from tyranny and despotic institutions.\\nThat from freedom of thought and enlightenment and good\\npolitical institutions you could create a new race of individuals was\\nthe somewhat extreme conclusion that these French thinkers\\nbuilt up out of the development of this philosophy of experience\\nof Locke; and while of course it was actually economic troubles\\nand distress that brought on the French Revolution, yet this idea\\nof the possibility of building a new civilization and the building\\nof a new type of humanity creating a new world of human beings\\ncame into the French Revolution, gave it ardor and enthusiasm\\nvery likely—a development by the French of this older\\nphilosophy of experience. And thus again in the general liberal ideas and\\nmore especially the development of democratic ideas in France\\nfollowing that in this country, which was more influenced by\\nJohn Locke than by any other one thinker, this democratic faith\\nwas also linked up with underlying conceptions of philosophy of\\nexperience.\\nIt seemed to me that, perhaps to be more useful, to point out\\nits larger bearing on the issue, probably it would be necessary to\\ngo into details concerning the third notion about the nature of\\nexperience. When I come to the third, however, I said there were\\nthree periods, stages of the idea. When I come to this which is the\\nmore recent, almost contemporary, aspect of the philosophy of\\nexperience, it does become necessary to go somewhat more into\\ntechnical detail: this conception of Locke\\'s emphasis, as I\\'ve\\nalready indicated, on the passivity of the mind, that experience\\ncomes to us from without, that experience is a sum of the\\nimpressions which objects and people outside made upon the mind.\\nLocke was so afraid of giving the mind any innate ideas or\\nprinciples that he tended to go to the opposite extreme and made it\\npurely passive and receptive. Now that idea that I have just\\nindicated, extreme as it was and faulty as it was, that fundamental\\nidea yet nevertheless did play a part, as I\\'ve just indicated, as an\\ninstrument of attack upon superstition and upon traditional and\\ndespotic institutions. The general principle was that laid down\\n  \\n                            \\nonce more by Locke. If our beliefs, even the over-complicated\\nones, those that have great, a greatest weight with us, are built up\\nby experience, then we can go back over experience and pick\\nthem to pieces; we can show exactly where these ideas came\\nfrom. And naturally those who used that method showed that a\\nlot of the ideas, creeds, standards of governing people, instead of\\ncoming from a very high source, came from a very earthly one,\\nthat they came from self-interest of people in power or that\\nthey\\'d grown accidentally. And they accepted them merely\\nbecause they happened to get established in some earlier period in\\nhistory. So this empirical method used to analyze prevailing ideas\\nwas a very powerful instrument of criticism and disillusionment,\\nof disintegration, and that time created an action against the\\nphilosophy of experience, at least against the philosophy in that\\nform, that experience is something where we are purely passive\\nand we receive impressions from without, and that these are built\\nup through associations in a more complex form.\\nThere were two great sources of reaction, and of the\\ndevelopment into the third form of philosophy of experience. One is the\\ndevelopment of biology, which showed that the human organism\\nwith which the mind is connected isn\\'t a purely passive thing.\\nAnybody who sees a baby ought almost to have known that\\nexperience wasn\\'t a purely passive thing; this theory held as it\\nwas—anyone who has observed how outreaching and active the\\nbabies are would have known that experience wasn\\'t purely a\\npassive thing. ^Really, it took a more scientific development of\\nbiology and physiology to bring out the significance of that fact\\nfor a theory of experience. Or to put it more specifically: not\\nto go back to the old theory of innate ideas, but to show that\\nexperience is what it is because of a motor element and active\\nelements and not merely because of a sensory element—that\\neven the eye or the ear, if you take a more static organ, is not\\nmerely passive, it is a motor organ, an active organ; you throw\\nthe hand and so on. That scientific factor is more and more\\nbringing about the new concept of experience and recognition of\\nthe motor outgrowing active element within experience itself.\\nThe other is more complex and associated with the fact that\\nthe earlier type of empiricism, that represented by Locke and\\nHelvetius and like eighteenth century philosophers, was much\\nmore powerful in criticism, in destruction, intellectual\\n  \\n                            \\ndestruction, than it was in construction, than in building up new ideas.\\nIt was very powerful as an instrument of man\\'s passion, of release\\nfrom old traditions and superstitions, but when it came to telling\\nwhat should take their place, it did not have anything like the\\nsame power.\\nWell, the further story takes me over into the subject of next\\nweek, \"The Problem of Thought.\" That is, where does thought\\ncome in? And it was that power of thought and of thinking\\nwhich was overlooked and neglected by this theory of experience\\nas simply an accumulation of impressions and sensations made\\npopular by Locke in the beginning, and his friends particularly,\\nhis friends and followers. And so I will continue this story of,\\ncarry the story of experience over into what I call the third stage\\nin connection with the discussion of the next hour, which will\\ndeal with the place of thinking, of intelligence, in experience,\\nwhy it has the place there, how it has the place, how because of\\nthat, experience can become active, productive, creative, and not\\nmerely passive and receptive.\\n  \\n                            \\nMethods in Philosophy and the Sciences [Paper read at The Conference on Methods in Philosophy and the Sciences, New\\nSchool for Social Research, New York, N.Y., 22-23 May 1937. Stenographic\\nreport in the Horace M. Kallen Papers, folder 95, Yivo Institute for Jewish\\nResearch, New York, N.Y.]\\n»»\\nI have shown my sympathy with the anti-authoritarian,\\nlibertarian campaign by departing from the subject which was\\nassigned to me. I am not going to attempt to give a program,\\nperhaps this is as near as I will come to the subject. What I am going\\nto say may perhaps be construed without too much torturing as\\na statement of some conditions that any program along the lines\\nindicated would have to meet. I can start in discussing these\\nconditions by stating that the problem with which I am going to\\nconcern myself was stated in the last point of Sidney Hook\\'s paper:\\nThe relative failure of those who accept the standpoint of\\nexperience and the experimental method to develop a method\\nadequately and explicitly for use in the various aspects of the social\\nsubjects, and not having thoroughly developed it, of course a\\nfailure to adapt and apply it consistently in the groundwork of\\nboth subjects. In other words, I think the primary condition that\\nhas to be met in forming a program is to accept the responsibility\\nfor simplicity, cooperative awareness of the fundamental\\nimportance of the problem of method and attempt to develop ^explicitly\\nand cooperatively the essential structure of such a non-\\nauthoritative, non-transcendental, empirical method.\\nIf I may refer to something which I said some time ago in a\\nspeech, liberals were so conscious of the suppressive, corruptive\\nand harmful work of the institutions which represented and\\nembodied authority, that they tended quite naturally, almost\\ninevitably, to look askance upon the principles of authority itself.\\nBut if we take authority, what seems to me in the legitimate\\nsense, the need for some principle of guidance in formation of\\n  \\n                            \\nbelief and action, the absence of authority means chaos and\\nconfusion, and that is what, as Dr. Hook has just said, just works\\nback into the hands of authoritarians, because a great mass of\\npeople will not put up indefinitely with the absence of any kind\\nof principles in their beliefs and actions. So it seems to me that\\nthe problem is that of recognition first of method as the source of\\nauthority for any non-dogmatic movement, and secondly, the\\nadequate development of a method which has sufficient claim to\\nbe taken as authority so as to be able to be self-creative, self-\\ndeveloping in its application. There are exceptions of course of\\nsome good forms of authoritarianism that we regard as good\\nover against those that we consider bad. Of course we don\\'t put\\nit to ourselves exactly that way, but when we see claims to\\nauthoritative power active and perhaps gaining power, it is a very\\nnatural human tendency to set up another authoritative power\\nover and against them. And so again I emphasize the fact that I\\nsee no way fundamentally in the long run to meet the claims of\\nauthoritarianism of different forms, excepting in the\\ndevelopment of scientific method. Not in itself of course is it developed,\\nbut with special references to its use in the various social lines of\\ninquiry and particularly, to anticipate a point which I shall touch\\nupon briefly at the close, as a kind of method on which there is a\\nneed for hypotheses, alternative possibilities. As far as I can see,\\nit is the only ultimate protection against dogmatism. Even the\\nphysical sciences, in spite of the fact that formation of multiple\\nhypotheses is a part of the technique, possibly suffered from a\\nkind of Newtonian orthodoxy that practically speaking made\\ncertain alternatives impermissible. It has possibly been true there\\nwas hardly any ground for making them during that period, but\\ncertainly the atmosphere for a long time was discouraging. Yet\\nwe know that when another type of physical hypothesis was\\nadmitted as legitimate it was developed.\\nNow, speaking not of sciences, but of popular beliefs, creeds,\\nconceptions, ideas, in the social fields, I think we all agree that\\nthere is much free play in considering alternatives. It is not\\nmerely the open partisanship that we find in politicians and the\\novert sectarianism in religious creeds and so on; but it is even\\nmore significant and potentially harmful, an unconscious,\\nundeveloped partisanship which works against even the willingness\\nto consider the possibility of any line of thought or action that\\n  \\n                            \\nhasn\\'t gotten some previous satisfaction. I liked very much what\\nDr. Kallen said about the two continents without connecting it\\nup with the conference. All dogmatism is by its nature an\\neconomy of scarcity, scarcity in forming a hypothesis and\\nentertaining alternative ideas. Any liberal creed, on the other hand, must\\nbe an economy of abundance in a freedom of developing\\nhypotheses. I am in a little dilemma on the one hand, if I don\\'t give any\\nillustration, my remarks are rather formal, and if I do, the\\nillustration may take attention away from the principle. But I want to\\nillustrate along the line of Sidney Hook without holding him\\nresponsible for the interpretation. Marx has made us very\\nfamiliar with the idea that every economic, legal and political order\\ndevelops its own internal contradictions and that those\\ncontradictions ultimately do away with the system, and lead on to\\nsomething else. Well, about that fact, I am not very enthusiastic\\nabout using the word contradiction. That, it seems to me,\\nrequires more propositions than actual social conditions—but that\\nis a minor point; that any regime does develop a lot of internal\\nconflicts and discrepancies, and that they tend gradually or\\nsuddenly to modify the system, and finally bring about another,\\nseems to me good historical sense. But possibly under the\\ninfluence of Hegel this dialectic is interpreted orthodoxly as very\\nrigid. This is just one thesis and an anti-thesis, and one\\nfundamental contradiction.\\nWell, now, that seems to me an illustration of an ^economy of\\nscarcity in thinking and in social and political matters. It seems\\nto me that at least there is a possibility, a chance that there are a\\nlot of discrepant forces, not just one contradiction, a number of\\nforces and contradictions that are pulling in different directions,\\nand therefore we are obliged to consider a number of possibilities\\nregarding the method in which these conflicts of forces and\\nconditions will work out.\\nWell, I want to go on from that to say, to put it first in a way\\nthat might chance to contradict, that the great weakness of\\nhistorical liberalism, or liberal temper, using that word for short, is\\nthat there has been a tendency merely to develop alternative\\npossibilities and stop short with setting them up, a sort of falling in\\nlove with the prospect of an economy of abundance, or on the\\nnegative side, a failure to consider the conditions under which\\ndecisions not only are objective but are this under these\\n  \\n                            \\nalternative possibilities. Now, if we consider the physical field in\\nwhich scientific method is better developed, we find that they\\nbegin with setting up alternative hypotheses. But that is only a\\nbeginning. It isn\\'t thought to be a nice lovely spectacle to look at,\\nbut it is a way of defining a problem and a way of indicating the\\nactivities that will have to be carried out in order to solve the\\nproblem. In other words it is the freedom of conditions, it is\\nlocation and description of the conditions of activities that are to be\\ncarried out which will end sooner or later, perhaps sooner,\\nperhaps later, and enable a positive decision to be made with respect\\nto that particular set of alternatives.\\nNow this earlier period of liberalism, it seems to me, was a\\nperiod when this which we think of as a survey of alternative\\npossibilities, and as he has suggested at least indirectly, liberals\\nwere a little too much inclined to take their personal\\nemancipations and the sense of liberation that they got from their personal\\nemancipations from dogmatism as being an end in itself instead\\nof an invitation and a very urgent invitation to go on and do\\nsomething about it. And that it seems to me gave liberalism its\\nmilk and water reputation and changed intellectual tolerance,\\nwhich is a positive fact, namely this freedom in the formation of\\nideas and hypotheses, into a moral attitude. \"Well, most\\nanything may be true, and it is a lovely world to have a great variety\\nof scenery, and therefore, let\\'s not get much excited about\\nanything in particular.\" And in that way this whole conception does\\nnot appear to be in any way aggressive social reform.\\nNow, coming more definitely to the social subject matter,\\nthere are two which seem to me to be main lines for programs\\nand experiments. One of them, of course, is the conceptual\\nformalism or formalistic rationalism. I am not going to dwell on\\nthat. Looking about I don\\'t believe there is a great deal of\\nliterature in these fields. It seems to me the movement, especially by\\nthe younger men, is very definitely away from the older\\nconceptual orthodoxies in political economy, politics and law. But in\\nthe reaction from that, it seems to me that the tendency is to call\\nblind empiricism,—which thinks that the task of social inquiry is\\nfulfilled by collecting, classifying and pigeon-holing, sometimes\\nquite literally in safety deposit vaults, a sufficient number\\nof facts,—a sort of worship of fact-finding. Well, of course as\\nagainst the older conceptual method, or any scientific method,\\n  \\n                            \\nfact-finding is a necessary condition, but hardly a sufficient one\\ntechnically, as in the social sciences. Very little technique is as yet\\nimportant matter to tell what a fact is or to enable us to\\nrecognize the social fragment when we see one. Some one says you are\\ndeveloping the technique of identifying facts. We can make a fact\\nout of most anything, even the most turbulent kind of material. I\\nsay the rationalism school was quite right in holding the bare\\nfacts. I announce that the bare facts are not even self-identified,\\nthat we have to have some kind of conceptual structure of ideas\\nwhich will organize and serve as instruments of locating. But I\\nthink these rationalistic schools were completely and terribly\\nwrong, terrible in their consequences and not realizing that this\\norganization has two ideas and conceptions and can be brought\\nabout only as the ideas are employed operationally, by which I\\nmean to direct actual activity that cannot be effective except in\\na pseudo matter, by ideas really as such, that is, apart from their\\ninstigating and directing certain lines of action. That leads me to\\nsuggest that one condition of the development of this program is\\nthat of considering the type of ideas that have some operational\\nform, that is, that we act upon, that really makes some kind of\\nsocial difference and a difference of a type that can be\\ndiscriminated, and that is significant. Now, that leads me to say, as far as\\nI can see, the fundamental cause for the great outburst of mere\\nfact-finding in the social disciplines is the failure to state social\\nproblems in terms of what the man in the street or people outside\\nthe range of science could call social problems. To the ordinary\\nman a social problem is some trouble, some experience,\\ndiscrepancy, conflict, need in actual conditions—war is a problem to\\na great many people, a great social problem. Inability to get\\nenough to eat is a social problem, and the difficulty that farmers\\nare under of getting prices for their crops that will enable them to\\nmake a living is what they call a social problem.\\nNow it seems to me that a good deal of what are called social\\nproblems in a technical social sense are self-set problems. A\\nPh.D. student—I don\\'t say a member of a faculty, but a Ph.D.—\\nthinks his own show would make a nice problem, so it becomes a\\nresearch problem, it becomes a problem for a hundred people,\\nwhile it hasn\\'t anything to do with any problem that demands\\naction and organized action for its solution. Well, then what is\\nthere to do excepting fact-finding? In other words, I don\\'t think\\n  \\n                            \\nthat fact-finding is out—it merely is a type of intellectual\\nmissile—I think it is a necessary consequence of any procedure that\\nfails to relate the social problems to problems of action,\\nproblems that can only be settled by action, and that fails, therefore,\\nto form the ideas and hypotheses, to collect the kinds of facts\\nthat are relevant to problems of action.\\nWhat I am going to quote isn\\'t specially relevant, but I don\\'t\\nlike to lose any opportunity to advertise this little booklet of\\nLancelot Hogben, The Retreat from Reason—it costs one\\nshilling, worth a good deal more than that. In his discussion (and his\\nretreat from reason is the retreat, the same thing we are\\ndiscussing here today, not from reason in the rationalistic sense but\\nretreat from intelligence), the retreat from reason is the penalty\\nwe are paying for an inherent dichotomy in the way we educate\\npeople. The training of the statesman and the man of letters gives\\nhim no provision of the technical forces which are shaping the\\nsociety in which he lives. The education of the scientists and the\\ntechnicians leaves them indifferent to the social consequences of\\ntheir own activities.\\nWell, excepting that this is covered in terms of education, that\\nis exactly the same point that I am trying to make. The actual\\nleaders, rulers, of society, the people who are most influential\\n(newspaper people, maybe, and members of Congress, cabinet\\nand whatever other officers), certainly don\\'t bother a great deal,\\nin spite of the temporary brain trust, about ideas and\\nideologies and methods that are worked out intellectually. On the\\nother hand, the intellectual, the scientific man, that is nominally\\nconcerned with that field, hasn\\'t shown any very great acute\\nconsciousness of social barriers of their inquiry or any great\\nresponse for relating their inquiries to the actual social problems.\\nIt isn\\'t of course a collection of facts, it isn\\'t necessary, but there\\nis a very great difference between merely collecting facts and\\ntaking a problem that is socially felt already and then inquiring\\nwhat kind of facts would enable us really to develop\\noperationally with that problem and then set to work where you can\\nget those plans.\\nWell, now, one thing more, or maybe two. There is another\\naspect of a good deal of the work done in the social sciences\\nwhich seems to me also to be the direct consequence of this\\nassociation of work and the methods of work from the actual social\\n  \\n                            \\nproblems in the ordinary, non-Pickwickian sense of social\\nproblems and the conducting of inquiry with relation to the\\ndetermination of social policy, which of course is practically what I\\'ve\\nbeen saying. Now it is easy to understand why people in the\\nsocial sciences have taken that field. Pressure for partisanship is\\nso great that the chastity and virginity of intellectual activity has\\nbeen best protected by a policy of isolation more or less\\nmonastic, withdrawal, keeping away from any practical problem, in\\nwhich it has been fairly easy to maintain impartiality and\\nscientific attitudes.\\nBut there is another point, the tendency to take the concept of\\nphysical sciences ex post facto into the social field of the\\nmeaning of the scientific method. Of course I don\\'t need to say that\\nscientific method has been more completely and adequately\\ndeveloped in the mathematical and physical field. Therefore\\nthose sciences have an enormous prestige. It might be factitious\\nbut fundamentally very damaging. Then there results the idea\\nthat in order to be scientific, investigation in economics,\\nsociology, or whatever, needs merely the general treatises of scientific\\nmethod which is doubtlessly applied in the other sciences, or else\\nthey aren\\'t being scientific. Well, that again seems to me to be a\\nnatural result, not merely of the prestige of the physical field but\\neven more from this dissociation of inquiry from the problems of\\nsocial action and the formation of social problems. Let me put it\\nthis way, if social subject matter does have any distinctive\\nfeatures, distinctive as over against that of physical subject matter,\\nhow is that fact going to be discovered and how (or what) is a\\ndistinctive characteristic going to be authentically discovered?\\nWell, I don\\'t see but one way. You can\\'t do it by speculative\\ndiscussion to point out certain differences, positive differences in a\\npositive social subject matter, purely argumentatively,\\ndialectically. But somebody else can come back on the other side. But if\\nthe thing is inquiry in the social subjects as related to social\\npolicies and social acts, then it seems to me that the distinctive\\nfeatures of social subject matter over against physical are bound\\nto come out and come out very strongly, and you will have a\\ncondition for the utilizing of the material and techniques of the\\nphysical sciences in the social field, but without having to\\nsurrender the autonomy of the social subjects too. I anticipate the\\nkind of result that I think would have been an argumentative\\n  \\n                            \\nmatter but is a fact in the physical sciences. I appear on the\\nground and say that is the only way we have of defining what is\\nphysical, which is by definition and description external to\\nhuman culture. But when we come to social subject matter we are\\nmixed up in it and it is mixed up in us, and if you think we can\\nget social science by just getting off and looking at it and writing\\ndown what we see, that is incorrect. That is the essential\\ncharacteristic of the social subject matter, and it attempts in the interest\\nof scientific purity and chastity to eliminate all value judgments\\nfrom the social sciences. And this seems to me the surest way of\\nnot merely sterilizing the human interest in it but in the end of\\njust getting pseudo-facts and not the real facts themselves. Well,\\nthat last point is the point I mentioned first.\\nIn accordance with cooperation and conversion among the\\nworkers in the different social fields, of course the philosopher\\ncan\\'t tell the student of law and of economics and sociology and\\npolitics what techniques of inquiry he is going to employ. Those\\nthings have to be developed like all techniques by those who are\\ndoing the work and within the field of the work itself. But the last\\ntime I had any opportunity, some weeks ago, to think about any\\nphilosophical problem, I was ^speaking on the unity of man and\\nyou will forgive me therefore if I go back to the last\\nphilosophic thoughts and say the economic man isn\\'t so popular as he\\nonce was, in the phraseology at least. I am not altogether sure\\nwhether he has actively disappeared from thinking, but in a\\ncertain way we have the economic man, and we have the\\npolitical man, and we have the legal man and we have the\\npsychological man, and perhaps the hardest to locate is the man; but still\\nwe have it, the moral man, the political man, the primitive man,\\nthe biological man, and the historic man, and so forth.\\nNow we all know that specialization is absolutely necessary.\\nBut I do not see how the social sciences can have the social effect\\nthat I presume they ought to have, and I do not see still more\\nhow they can become a good army, more than a fighting weapon,\\nagainst authoritarianism unless they somehow can develop, I\\nwill say, a more conscious cooperation; but more conversion of\\nthe methods used and of the conclusions made, which make\\ncertain greater unity of methods and consequently, a greater mutual\\nagreement between the conclusions of the subject specialization,\\nis necessary. But it is a queer thing that the last thing about a\\n  \\n                            \\nworker in any special field is that he feels no responsibility for\\nchecking up and coordinating the results in one field with the\\nresults in the other. So having dodged, as successfully as I could,\\nthe question of laying down the program, I would say that it\\nseems to me that the essence of the program on the practical side\\nis this matter of greater mutual understanding, greater\\nconsideration of points where there is possible unity of method and\\nresult, translatability between the workers in the different social\\nfields—and I am not setting up any special plea for philosophy\\nthere, because from my own point of view, philosophy as well as\\npsychology is ultimately one of the fields of social ^inquiry.\\n  \\n                            \\nBetween Two Worlds [Address delivered at the Winter Institute of Arts and Sciences, University of\\nMiami, Coral Gables, Fla., 20 March 1944. Typescript in Special Collections,\\nOtto G. Richter Library, University of Miami.]\\n»»\\nNot even the wisest and most far-seeing of men\\ncould have predicted—or even roughly anticipated—only fifty\\nyears ago the course which events have actually taken. Idealists\\ndreamed their dreams. Their visions when viewed in the light\\nof what has taken place are mostly remarkable for presenting\\nalmost the blank opposite of what has happened. Waves that\\nnow appear to have been only the surface were treated as if they\\nwere irresistible tides. Hardheaded realists do not make a better\\nshowing. Those who supposed they were realists were in fact but\\nreaping an immediate harvest of personal advantage. Their pre-\\noccupation with that narrow concern contributed mightily to\\ncreation of the present state of affairs.\\nWhen I look about to find a symbol of their unwisdom I think\\nof the reckless exploitation of natural resources that marks our\\nhistory. Our forefathers proceeded as if the fertility of our soil\\nwere unexhaustible; as if mines and forests were eternally self-\\nrenewing. Spent soils, burntover forests, depleted oilwells,\\nfished-out waters are part of the price paid. Even now we are\\nhardly more than half-awake to the consequences of the policy of\\nneglecting the future in order to make the most possible out of\\nthe immediate present. The symbol is defective, however, in that\\nthe waste mentioned was of material things, for there was also\\nwaste of human values. As two wars in a generation, the second\\nmore deadly than the first, amply prove there was also tragic\\nneglect of the things upon which human happiness depends.\\nBoth idealists and realists ^were too much intoxicated by the\\nnew resources which for the first time in human history were at\\n  \\n                            \\ntheir disposal, to look ahead and prepare for the new world that\\nwas being born. The intoxication of him whom I have called the\\nidealist was generous. Beholding a future which science and the\\nindustrial conquest of the energies of nature was making\\npossible, he thought and acted as if some natural law of inevitable\\nprogress were bound to bring all the better possibilities to\\nrealization. The one whom I have called the realist was intoxicated\\nby ability to enjoy the goods which the new science and the new\\nindustry had brought into the world.\\nBoth alike failed to see that the new forces demanded new\\nmethods and new purposes unless they were to all but devour the\\nmankind which produced them. They easily found excuses for\\ntheir failure. The forces that were operating were so new that\\nthey did not have the material upon which to base foresight of\\ntheir consequences. We of the present day do not have their\\nexcuse. The only attitude today which is genuinely realistic is one\\nwhich sees that we are living in a moving world, one changing at\\na rate unknown to all previous history. What we call the present\\nis nothing stable. It is but the pivot on which changes turn. And\\ninstead of the changes being regulated by some impersonal law\\nof necessary progress and evolution, we and what we as human\\nbeings plan and strive to execute is a necessary factor in giving\\ndirection to what will happen. In a genuine sense we are creators\\nof the future world.\\nScience, technology, industrial conquest of nature, are not\\nimpersonal forces going their own way independently of us. They\\nare what we human beings do with them and make out of them.\\nEvery one knows that tools, machinery, the apparatus of\\nscientific discovery, were invented and constructed by human beings\\nin the course of setting their knowledge at work. What we have\\nfailed to see is that the direction in which they move after they\\nhave been invented along with the social consequences they\\nproduce, are equally a human matter and a human\\nresponsibility. Discussions of the possibility and the desirability of human\\nplanning are too often oblivious of the fact that refusal to do the\\nbest we can in the way of planning is abdication of a\\nresponsibility that events have imposed upon us.\\nI believe that an outline of the things we need most to think\\nabout and to plan for may be derived from noting where the\\nbeliefs and hopes and methods of men say fifty years ago, or in\\n  \\n                            \\nthe nineties, went estray. Politically it was the common belief that\\nthe future of democracy was practically assured; that it was\\ncertain that the course of events in no very long time would\\noverthrow despotic rulers in all countries. There was also the\\nexpectation that the cause of peace among nations was reasonably\\nassured; that war was bound to disappear, along with other relics\\nof barbarism, because of advance in civilization. In the third\\nplace, while there was no expectation of the speedy complete\\nabolition of poverty, there was general belief that its dire forms\\nwould disappear, and that an enduring era of prosperity would\\nenlarge the extent of the middle class, so as gradually to do away\\nwith extremes of wealth and poverty.\\nIt is unnecessary to dwell upon the tragic disappointments\\nthese three hopes have undergone in less than fifty years. Instead\\nof steady growth of democracy, the world has seen the rise of\\ndictatorships. And what is even more significant, they have owed\\ntheir rise in large measure to popular belief that they could\\naccomplish more for the mass of the people than would or could\\ndemocratic institutions. Two world wars, infinitely more\\nextensive and destructive than anything prior history has to show,\\nhave reduced expectation of permanent peace almost to the\\nstatus of a dream. Economically and industrially, the memory of\\nlong years of depression and unemployment, requiring\\ngovernmental intervention on a large scale, is still vividly with us.\\nFrom the vantage point of the present, it is not hard to see how\\nand why the reversals occurred. Men relied upon the growing\\ninterdependence of the peoples of the earth to bring about steady\\nadvance in the desired direction. Commerce, industry, growth of\\nthe means of communication between countries physically\\nfar apart, did in fact produce interdependence. As Mr. Willkie\\nrecently reminded us, we now live in what to all intents and\\npurposes is One World. Distance, the isolating and divisive power of\\nseas and vast spaces, has been overcome. Steamship and ocean\\ncables began a work which radio and airplane have carried\\nthrough. For good or bad, we are now and henceforth more like\\nclose neighbors in a crowded city than like the widely separate\\npeoples in which our grandparents carried on their affairs in\\ngovernment and industry. The mistake was not in looking\\nforward to a time of interdependence. It lay in supposing that the\\nbreaking down of physical barriers, the mere bringing of peoples\\n  \\n                            \\ninto closer physical contact, would automatically create moral\\nunification.\\nThe debit side of interdependence is more in evidence now\\nthan any credit side. An interdependence which is the product\\nsimply of industrial production and commercial exchange has\\nturned out to be mainly a creation of new points of friction and\\nextension of old sore spots. Rivalry and competition in industry\\nand in nationalistic ambitions has extended to become deadly\\ncompetition in all the means of destruction. We cannot pick up a\\ndaily paper in which the word \"global\" does not remind us of the\\nnew situation in which we live physically, but without the\\nintellectual, the educational, the moral preparation that might enable\\nus to cope with the problems it thrusts upon us.\\nThree-quarters of a century ago Abraham Lincoln said that a\\nnation could not endure half-slave and half-free. Today it is true\\nthat a civilization cannot endure when physical energies,\\nelectricity, light, chemical reaction, physical materials, iron, coal, oil,\\nthe atmosphere itself, are brought under a physical control that\\nhas revolutionized the face of the globe, while the ideas and\\nideals that rule us are still largely those of a pre-scientific, pre-\\nindustrial, pre-technological age. One can understand, even\\nwhen one does not sympathize, the home-sickness of political\\nisolationists for return to the conditions of a simpler stage. The\\ntrouble is that they want something which is physically\\nimpossible, even were it desirable in the abstract. The really dangerous\\npeople are the intellectual and educational isolationists who urge\\nus in morals, education, and philosophy, yes even in religion, to\\nshut our minds to the new forces now active in the world and live\\nupon shreds of beliefs that were formed in and that belong to\\nages that are past and gone. There is today but one genuine\\nconservatism and one genuine realism. Realism is to face the\\nrealities of the present world; conservatism consists in planning\\nand carrying out the new measures and policies in educational,\\npolitical and moral action which will take account of and keep\\npace with the physical changes hurrying us into an unknown\\nfuture.\\nOne does not have to argue to prove the existence of global\\nphysical conditions. It is enough to point to the war in which this\\ncountry along with almost every country of the globe is engaged.\\nBut the fact that it is war which provides the evidence is also\\n  \\n                            \\nproof of absence of moral unification. It points to the nature of\\nthe scope, the immensity and the intensity, of the task which lies\\nahead of us. It points to the futility of all thinking, planning and\\npractical effort that is not global in reach. As yet these things are\\nstill largely local, provincial. Politically, our beliefs and standards\\nare nationalistic, not global. Something that is wholly unreal\\nin the present state of the world called national sovereignty is\\nappealed to and employed as if it had significance.\\nBeyond paying taxes and engaging in some useful kind of\\nvolunteer effort, most of us who are here this evening are not taking\\npart physically in the present war. We do share, and share deeply,\\nin the psychological and moral conditions that have produced\\nthis war, and which, if they are allowed their way, will produce\\nthe next and still more destructive one. At least this is true as far\\nas we are actuated by ideas and policies that were generated\\nduring the period of formation of independent and\\nirresponsible nations, each claiming ultimate unlimited sovereignty for\\nitself. Patriotism then took on a shape and color which were fitted\\nto formation of peoples who touched one another only at\\ntheir remote edges. To persist in that kind of patriotism when\\nactual forces, like the radio and press and equally like the bomb\\nthat spreads death and leaves rubble where there once were\\ncities, are doing away with old boundaries is the road to national\\ndisaster, with little assurance that by the time of the next war,\\nour own towns and homes will be as physically exempt as in the\\npresent one.\\nThe old world began to melt away in the fifteenth\\ncentury because of the discovery, exploration and exploitation of\\nnew lands. The known civilized world had not previously\\nextended far beyond the Mediterranean Basin even physically; the\\nbeliefs and institutions which controlled that world culturally\\nand morally were exclusively the product of the countries, Egypt,\\nPalestine, Greece, Rome, that form that Basin. We owe an\\nimmense debt to the contributions made by these countries. But the\\nmovement of expansion that had its beginning in the fifteenth\\ncentury did a great deal more than merely enlarge the physical\\nboundaries of the civilized world. While that was the direct effect\\nof the expansive movement, the new sciences of nature and the\\nnew modes of technological invention and production, the rapid\\nspread of commerce, all that goes by the name of the industrial\\n  \\n                            \\nrevolution, were its indirect consequences. In the long run they\\nwere its important result.\\nThe old astronomy with its finite bounded cosmos, having the\\nearth as its fixed centre, corresponds closely to the limited area of\\nthe old area civilization. The physical science throughout this\\nwhole earlier period, lasting thousands of years, regarded fixity,\\nchangelessness, as the highest principle, the very measure of\\nperfection. Change was taken to be proof of defect and\\nimperfection. The revolution in astronomy, the work of Kepler and\\nCopernicus, opened up a new and unbounded vista, which\\nwas the effect and counterpart of the human and geographical\\nexpansion that was going on. Revolution in physics and\\nchemistry, and then in the science of plants and animals, put change in\\nthe place that had been held by fixity. Time and temporal things\\nencroached upon what had been supposed to be eternal.\\nThe latter part of the nineteenth century and the first decades\\nof the twentieth century are but the physical completion of the\\nexpansive movement which for four centuries had been first\\nencroaching upon and then breaking down the walls that kept\\nthe peoples of the earth separate and divided.\\nI say the physical completion. For the institutions and basic\\nbeliefs of mankind continued for the most part to be those which\\nwere created in and suited to the indefinitely longer period of\\nconfinement and restriction in which moral and intellectual\\nstability were identified with absence of change. Literally, we are\\nnow living between two worlds, and the responsibility placed\\nupon us is that of creating the intellectual and moral attitudes\\nthat will support institutions, international and domestic,\\npolitical, educational and cultural, that correspond to the physical\\nrevolution which has taken place; and whose consequences are\\nso largely negative just because of the absence of corresponding\\ninstitutional change. We cannot indeed understand the present\\nand prepare for the future without knowledge of the past. But it\\nis ignorance of the past, not knowledge of it, which fails to take\\naccount of its most outstanding features, namely, the accelerated\\nrate of change and the causes which have produced it:—the new\\nscience and the new technology.\\nThe present crisis, which is the manifestation of great physical\\nchange combined with absence of corresponding moral and\\ninstitutional change, goes deep as well as extends far and wide.\\n  \\n                            \\nThere are no traditions which are not challenged or shaken in\\nsome respect. The passing away of the geographical, the\\nphysical, barriers, which have kept peoples and races and cultures\\ndivided for by far the greater extent of human history, has gone\\nfar enough to create confusion, uncertainty, and open and\\nwidespread conflict. But the intellectual and moral consequences of\\ninbred isolation remain. Rivalry, suspicion, fear and mutual\\nhatred are the fruit. War between nations externally and racial\\nand class antagonisms internally are the visible and tangible\\nmanifestation of the disturbance.\\nIf one looks back upon what we call the Victorian Age one\\nfinds that the prevailing temper was one of hope. Commerce and\\nintercommunication were automatically going to bring peoples\\ninto harmony with one another. It was forgotten that the human\\nfactor in the situation was the psychological outlook and the\\nmoral disposition that were bred in thousands and thousands of\\nyears of ingrowing isolation, and that without radical alteration\\nin this human factor physical and external contact and\\ninteraction could, as I have said, be for the most part only an occasion\\nof new friction and extension of old antagonisms.\\nThe positive aspect of the crisis is that mankind in facing a\\nnew situation has a new responsibility imposed upon it—a\\nresponsibility that leaves nothing untouched. The men who engaged\\nearlier in social philosophizing looked upon the changes that\\nwere going on as a process of natural evolution in the direction\\nof greater harmony, cooperation, peace, and increase of\\nopportunity and freedom for all. The present crisis teaches us the folly\\nand futility of trusting to what is called nature, outside of human\\nnature, to a policy of let alone and laissez-faire. But it can also\\nteach us that a revolutionary change in the conditions under\\nwhich life goes requires a corresponding transformation in our\\nown dispositions and attitudes—one which will substitute\\nlooking to the future rather than the past and planning for passive\\nacquiescence; the planning combines cooperative effort in every\\nfield, international and domestic, cultural, political, economic,\\nfor the isolationism which is an individualism as destructive, as it\\nis impossible, under present conditions.\\nIt is of course much easier to state in general terms the\\nnecessity for psychological and moral change than it is to give a bill of\\nparticulars. But we may find at least a clue to the direction in\\n  \\n                            \\nwhich we should move by noting the immense part that has been\\nplayed by science in production of the present human worldwide\\nsituation. It is the basic source of the discoveries and the\\ninventions which are changing the face of the earth. In the last\\ncentury there was general belief that the advance in science\\nmeant advance in general enlightenment that in turn would be\\nthe cause of general social advance. This belief was an integral\\npart of the optimistic belief in automatic evolution of which I\\nhave spoken. Just now pessimism tends to replace optimism as\\nfar as science is concerned.\\nWe are told, and from many and influential quarters, that\\nundue faith in science has been our undoing. We are told that the\\nrise of natural science has invaded and depressed the humane\\nand humanistic values that are rightfully supreme; that it has\\nstrengthened materialistic interests and subordinated ideal moral\\nends and principles. In putting naturalism in the place of\\nsupernaturalism, it has led men we are told to immense exaggeration\\nof what is worldly and thus removed the only effective check\\nupon unbridled selfishness. The return to the past which is now\\nbeing urged upon us has for one of its mainsprings a return to a\\nsupernaturalism which puts science and human intelligence in\\npermanent subjection to external authority.\\nNo one who is both observant and candid can deny that things\\nare out of balance. War, economic instability, and the attacks\\nmade upon democratic and popular institutions tell the tale. But\\nwith respect to science, as to other things, the lesson of the\\npresent crisis is the impossibility of going backward and the\\nnecessity for going forward. It is a striking fact that the new\\nscience began with things that are the furthest away from man, the\\nstars. Gradually, the new ways of employing intelligence to\\nobserve and to test were extended to the things of physics and\\nchemistry, and then, to some extent, to living things. But the\\ngreat opposition aroused by efforts to extend science to the study\\nof life is multiplied indefinitely when it comes to man and\\ndistinctively human affairs. The nearer we approach what is human,\\nthe greater the resistance to the use of those methods of\\nintelligent observation, report and test that have revolutionized our\\nphysical understanding.\\nThere is no doubt that the present crisis is one of disturbed\\nbalance between materialistic and moral values. But the lesson to\\n  \\n                            \\nbe learned is not the need of arbitrary subjection of scientific\\ninquiry to external authority, but the opposite: The need of\\nsystematic application of directed intelligence in discovery of the\\nsolid facts of human relationships. A civilization cannot endure\\nin which inquiry is free with respect to knowledge of physical\\nthings but is enslaved when it comes to understanding of man\\nand his affairs.\\nThe actual alternative to use of that method of intelligence,\\nwhich is called science, is use of a mixture of exhortation and\\nwith reliance upon traditions, habits, institutions, which were\\nadjusted to bygone conditions, but whose use now is sure to\\npromote confusion and conflict—since they are the outward\\nexpression of inner confusion and conflict. This sort of internal\\ndivision promotes the use of force wielded by external dictatorial\\nauthority to try to establish the unity without which after all\\na society cannot endure. From this point of view, the rise of\\nFascism and Naziism is no accident.\\nWe too suffer from lack of balance, though it has not gone\\nanything like as far. It is seen, for example, in the attitude\\ncommonly taken toward planning. There is not a large industrial\\nenterprise that does not owe success in its own field to systematic\\nplanning, based upon study of events carried on by a staff of\\nexperts. But in the human field, in social and political matters,\\nplanning is ridiculed as impracticable and even as offensive to the\\nspirit of our institutions. We can hardly listen to a political\\nspeech or read a newspaper editorial without hearing or seeing\\nsocial planning referred to as starry-eyed idealism. Yet absence of\\nplanning is both the manifestation of the lack of balance between\\nthe physical and the moral conditions of our life and is an active\\npromotion of that drifting which leaves us at the mercy of\\nconditions. For planning is everywhere, in little and great things alike,\\na necessary condition of direction and regulation.\\nWe do not have to search far to discover how the policy of\\ndrift—if it can be called a policy to use our intelligence only after\\nan emergency has come upon us—conduces to confusion.\\nConsider the high price in human suffering and loss that we have paid\\nfor our unwillingness to learn in the field of international\\nrelations the lesson which the First World War would seem to have\\nfairly flung in our face. If we had submitted it to examination we\\nshould have seen in it a demonstration, more convincing than a\\n  \\n                            \\ndemonstration in a laboratory of physical science, of the social\\ndisunion and conflict, which has been created by physical science\\nisolated from understanding of human affairs and relationships.\\nWhile physically speaking the world has been for untold years\\nthe spherical body our geography textbooks tell about, it has not\\nbeen round in a human sense for much more than fifty years. Yet\\nwe go on trusting to a combination of luck, outworn tradition\\nand temporary improvisations to meet the problems the new\\nmethods of science and technology have forced upon us.\\nThe hope for harmony and peaceful cooperation which\\nanimated nineteenth century thought has been rudely challenged.\\nThe cause of democracy has been violently assaulted, not just in\\nwords but in facts that speak louder than words. What claimed\\nto be the wave of the future swept out of existence institutions of\\nself-government in many countries and replaced them by\\ndictatorships imposed from above. In some European countries\\nevents seemed to justify the assertion that democracy belonged\\nto the historic past, and that the only way to overcome the self-\\nseeking and class divisions that inhered (so it was said) in\\n\"liberal\" societies was rule from above. This rule was to do away\\nwith the evils of democratic individualism by imposing total\\nunion:—A union that compelled not just unity in action but\\nidentity of belief in every phase of life, religious, moral, political,\\neconomic. This totalitarianism was enforced by suppression of\\nfreedom of inquiry, speech, the press, and assemblage, even for\\nreligious purposes. The concentration camp replaced meeting for\\nfree discussion. Toleration of diversity of belief and choice of\\nparty and creed was said to be a disease of democracy to be\\nexcised by radical social surgery.\\nIt is impossible to imagine a more complete denial of the\\ndemocratic principle of E Pluribus Unum, of unity out of\\ndiversity, than is presented by totalitarianism. For toleration in\\ndemocracy is more than merely putting up with or \"standing\"\\ndiversity of belief, while permitting experimentation with ideas.\\nIt is grounded in the belief that the social and moral unity to be\\nachieved by free cooperative discussion is deeper, more solid and\\nmore secure than that which can be attained by any kind of\\nexternal imposition.\\nThe reaction against democracy teaches, however, the same\\nlesson that is taught by the rise of hostility and conflict in the\\n  \\n                            \\nfield of international relations. The new situation which has been\\ncreated by the new methods of science and technology does not\\ndemand surrender of democracy on the ground that it fosters an\\nindividualism which undermines unity and saps the strength\\nwhich comes from unity, putting all on the same dead level\\nirrespective of difference in talent. But it does demand\\nreconsideration of the forms and techniques which developed in and were\\nappropriate to this country in a pioneer period. It demands a\\nreconsideration of the nature of individuality and the means by\\nwhich it can be made secure under present conditions.\\nThe kind of individualism that developed when the natural\\nresources of the country were practically untapped and when\\nthere was open opportunity for all to reap the rewards of\\ninitiative and enterprise, is not suited to an era in which natural\\nresources have been appropriated and often monopolized, and in\\nwhich working equality of opportunity easily becomes a\\nbyeword with which to cover up inequality bred by vast\\ndifferences in wealth. The ideals and aims of democracy are the same\\ntoday that they were in the pioneer era of our country. To\\nsuppose, however, that they can be realized by just the same\\nmethods, institutions and attitudes that operated in pioneer times is\\nanother case of trusting to chance and to the blind uncontrolled\\nworking of natural forces to promote the freedom, equality and\\nfraternity that are the enduring goals of democracy.\\nTo speak in more concrete terms, the ideas that are to be\\nentertained and put into practice regarding the function and methods\\nof government have to undergo a great change from those of the\\nearlier period of the Republic. When democracy was new, it\\nstood over against governments that were oppressive and that\\nassumed inequality of classes as the natural and proper state of\\nmankind. The vast open range of free opportunity in this\\ncountry blended with jealous suspicion of governmental power. The\\npossibilities of democracy as positive and constructive Self-\\ngovernment were unrealized and untested. There was no\\nbackground of experience by which to create a concrete image of a\\nsociety in which governors and governed were one and the same\\nbody, having identical interests.\\nThere is no doubt as to need for continued vigilance. Too\\neasily, as history proves, do the interests of officials become\\nseparate from those of the mass of the people. The holding of office\\n  \\n                            \\nthen becomes through corruption and oppression a source of\\nprivate gain. But that fact does not mean such a minimizing of\\ngovernmental action as is equivalent to political abdication. This\\nconception of individualism is an invitation to totalitarian\\ngovernment as a cure. Viewed intelligently and realistically, we find\\nthat a new positive responsibility is imposed. Just as genuinely\\npeaceful relations among nations cannot be secured save by\\nsystematic intelligent study, foresight and planning, so with\\ndemocracy within a nation. The development of procedures and\\ntechniques, legal, political, economic, which will foster and\\nsustain equal freedom for all, instead of irresponsible freedom for a\\nfew and constraint and depression for the many, is the\\noutstanding social problem of our age. It requires the kind of vigilance\\nwhich is positively expressed in study, planning,\\nexperimentation, to establish institutions which will make equality of\\nopportunity and hence freedom realities for all—not slogans to be\\nmanipulated by a class for its one separate interest.\\nI cannot conclude without saying a few words about the\\nbearing of what has been said upon the prospects and opportunities\\nof youth now growing into maturity. I think there is something\\nnew and indicative of the new world into which we are entering\\nin thinking of the young as the guardians of the future. In the\\npast they have been regarded as passive vessels to be filled with\\ntraditions formed in the past; as receptive clay to be molded into\\nconformity with customary institutions. The problem of looking\\nto the future instead of to the past, of studying the present to find\\nopportunities for shaping the future through intelligent planning\\nand experimentation, is something new. It is an attitude which is\\nstill inchoate. But it exists in sufficient measure to affect seriously\\nour thinking and our action regarding youth and education:—\\nNot just the education given in the schools (though it includes\\nthat) but the wider education gained more or less unconsciously\\nin the family, the neighborhood, the playground, by listening to\\nradios and reading newspapers, and above all by association\\nwith others.\\nThe problem of so educating youth that they will be effective\\ncreators of the future—for it is only through creative acts that\\nthey can be its guardians—is a tremendously difficult one. The\\none certain thing about the future is its uncertainty, just as the\\nonly thing which is constant is change. Moreover, nothing could\\n  \\n                            \\nbe more unfair than to place upon the young the responsibility\\nfor undoing the mistakes of their elders. Nor do I have in mind\\nthe absurd notion that the young shall be engaged in endless and\\nfutile peering into the future. The best possible preparation for\\nany future is the development of certain attitudes in the present.\\nWhen change is as rapid and as extensive as it now is, this applies\\nwith double force. What is wanted in the way of preparation for\\nthe future is that the young be so educated and aware that they\\nare living in a world of change and realization that continued\\nchange is inevitable, and that they come to possess some kind of\\nchart of the directions in which change is taking place.\\nPossession of an open mind is a necessary part of the\\ndisposition that can deal effectively with change; but too much of\\ntraditional education, especially in the school and other set forms of\\ninstruction, tends to create the closed mind—and the closed\\nmind is that which is shut to realization of change and cannot\\ncope with it. The open mind is not one which says in effect\\n\"Come right in; there is no one home at home.\" It is something\\nactive and positive. The open mind is the mark of those who\\nhave (in all their special learning) learned the eagerness to go on\\nlearning and the ability to make this desire a reality. The one\\nprecious thing that can be acquired in school or anywhere else\\nis just this constant desire and ability. The most serious defect\\nin our schools and other set forms of instruction is that instead\\nof making learning to be an active ongoing process, they identify\\nit with what is called scholarship and scholarship with\\nownership of fact and principles acquired with a minimum of active\\npersonal observation and stored away in memory. Learning is\\ntreated as acquisition of what is stored up in textbooks or is told\\nthem by others, and the kind of passive possession which can be\\ntested by examinations. The next effect shapes the mind to look\\nbackward; to rob it of power to see and judge what is actually\\ngoing on around us. There will be almost a revolution in school\\neducation when study and learning are treated not as acquisition\\nof what others know but as development of capital to be invested\\nin eager alertness in observing and judging the conditions under\\nwhich one lives. Yet until this happens, we shall be ill-prepared to\\ndeal with a world whose outstanding trait is change.\\nLearning as eagerness to learn, learning how to learn, includes\\nof course learning use of books. But men who learn use of\\n  \\n                            \\ntelescopes and microscopes do not learn to look at them. They learn\\nto look through them so as better to see other things, and the\\nthings they learn to see are the things that exist and act in the\\ncommon world around them, whether stars in heaven, insects\\nthat harm plants, or the chemical changes going on all the time in\\nthings, but which without the aid of these devices go unseen. The\\nfacts of physiology are not in books. They are in our own bodies,\\nand in the transactions carried on by the organs of the body with\\nthe air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat. Without\\nknowing how to use books our ability to get at and understand\\nactual facts would be reduced almost to zero. But the usual\\ncourse is to treat what is in books as an end in themselves instead\\nof means of creating ability to see and judge things which are\\noutside of books.\\nWhen men were living in a relatively fixed world, in conditions\\nthat changed so slowly that they did not seem to change at all,\\nwhat was learned from books was a natural supplement to what\\nwas learned from life. Living in a world that is changing and that\\nis bound to go on changing whether we like it or not, demands\\nsubordination of what is acquired from books. Continued use of\\nscholastic aims and methods that suited the world that no longer\\nexists tends to fixations and to swallowing things whole; to\\nallowing others speaking dogmatically and with external\\nauthority to form our judgments and dictate our opinions. These\\nare the things that create the closed mind, and the closed mind is\\nthat which incapacitates us to cope with the new conditions\\nwhich change is sure to bring upon us. In the field of science\\ndiscovery rules. In the field of industry, invention is supreme. In\\nthe field of school instruction, they lag far behind. Even at the\\npresent there is an active movement to shut out the moderate\\nprogress that has been made by enstating acquisition of what was\\nknown or believed in the past as the supreme educational need.\\nIn so far as this movement succeeds it will increase the lack of\\nbalance that now exists between dispositions and habits that are\\nthe result of education and the conditions of the world in which\\nthe products of education have to operate. Whether we like it or\\nnot we are deeply involved in a complex of new forces which are\\nso new that we have not as yet the ability to direct their course.\\nTwo alternatives present themselves in education. One is to\\ncontinue to tread the paths that have been worn by scholastic\\n  \\n                            \\ntradition and institutionalized habit. The other alternative is\\nwhole-hearted recognition that the schools are a vital part of the\\nmoving and changing scene, sharing in movement and having\\nthe responsibility of preparing the youth who are guardians and\\nshapers of the future to play their part in forming a free, just and\\nworthy social order. In case we adopt and energetically pursue\\nthis course, we shall be able to face the scene of change with\\nhope and courage—traits which are the proper and the just\\nheritage of youth.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe Future of Philosophy [Address delivered to the Graduate Department of Philosophy, ColumbiaUniver-sity,\\nUniversity, New York, N.Y., 13 November 1947. Stenographic report in the John Dewey\\nPapers, Box 55, folder 5, Special Collections, Morris Library, Southern Illinois\\nUniversity at Carbondale.]\\n»»\\n^Professor Edman is responsible for the title of my talk.\\nThe title is more vivid than any I would have thought of. He tells\\nme that he heard me talk on this subject five years ago.\\nFortunately, I have forgotten what I said at that time. I had more\\nhopes five years ago than I have now. My fears have increased\\nwithin the last five years, and my fears have more to do with\\nwhat I have to say than my hopes.\\nI shall begin by stating briefly the standpoint from which I see\\nphilosophy—the business of philosophy, that with which\\nphilosophy is concerned. I think that from my standpoint, the poorest\\nidea about philosophy is that it is a theory about \"being,\" as the\\nGreeks called it, or about \"reality,\" as so much of modern\\nphilosophy has assumed that philosophy was. As I may suggest later,\\none of the incidental positive advantages of the present retreat of\\nphilosophy is that it\\'s becoming recently clear that philosophy\\nhasn\\'t made any great success in dealing with \"reality.\" And\\nthere is hope that it may take some more human standpoint to\\ndeal with.\\nMy standpoint is that philosophy deals with cultural\\nproblems, using culture in the broad sense which the anthropologists\\nhave made clear to us—dealing with the patterns of human\\nrelationships. It includes such subjects as language, religion,\\nindustry, politics, fine arts, in so far as there is a common pattern\\nrunning through them, rather than as so many separate and\\nindependent things. The principal task of philosophy is to get below\\nthe turmoil that is particularly conspicuous in times of rapid\\n  \\n                            \\ncultural change, to get behind what appears on the surface, to get to\\nthe soil in which a given culture has its roots. The business of\\nphilosophy is the relation that man has to the world in which he\\nlives, as far as both man and the world are affected by culture,\\nwhich is very much more than is usually thought.\\nThere wasn\\'t any \"physical world\" for a very long time, or\\nanything called \"physics\" as a subject matter as at present. It was\\nonly when human culture had developed to a certain point that\\nphysics became a distinctive subject matter. A lot of things had\\nto be stripped off—animistic things. The world was previously\\nseen through human eyes in terms of human customs, desires,\\nand fears. It wasn\\'t til the beginning of modern science (the\\nsixteenth century) that a world distinctively physical came into\\nrecognized acknowledged existence. This is merely an\\nillustration of the transforming power of culture, in this broad sense of\\nraw material.\\nBecause the business of philosophy is with the relations that\\nexist between man and his world, as both are affected by\\nculture, the problems of philosophy change as the world in which\\nman lives changes. An example is the increased knowledge in our\\ntime of machines, technology, etc. The problems of philosophy,\\ntherefore, are simply bound to change, although there may be\\nsome underlying structures that remain throughout the changes.\\nTherefore, the history of philosophy still has to be written. It\\nneeds to be seen and reported in terms of the distinctive features\\nof culture. There is a sort of formalistic recognition of this fact\\nin present histories—they are divided into sections on ancient,\\nmedieval, and modern philosophy, western and oriental\\nphilosophy. These serve as certain headings for the material. But they\\nare not carried out in the details of philosophical systems.\\nI come now to my hopes and fears. The hope for philosophy is\\nthat those who engage in philosophy professionally will\\nrecognize that we are at the end of one historical epoch and at the\\nbeginning of another. The teacher and student should attempt to\\ntell what sort of change is taking place. In all events, this\\nrecognition of changes, of ages, of epochs in the world\\'s history isn\\'t\\nan invention of mine. Every history formally recognizes division\\ninto ages. We are approaching a change from one period to\\nanother; we are undergoing the same kind of change, as a\\nchange, that happened when the medieval period lost its hold on\\n  \\n                            \\nthe people\\'s beliefs and activities. We recognize this now as the\\nbeginning of a new epoch. This new epoch is largely the\\nconsequence of the new natural science, which began about the\\nsixteenth century with Galileo and Newton, as the applications of\\nthat science revolutionized men\\'s ways of living and their\\nrelations to each other. These have created the characteristics of\\nmodern culture and its essential problems.\\nThe more destructive features are more prominent than the\\nmore constructive phases. For a while, no survey of the world\\nwas presented without some reference to the fission of the atom.\\nWe see now that this is significant because it is a symbol of the\\nchanges that have been going on in science.\\nThere\\'s no secret in the fact that physical aspects of scientific\\ninquiry and their applications have very far outrun inquiry into\\nhuman subject matter—economics, politics, and morality. This\\nover-weighting on one side gives the clue to what should be hoped\\nfor in a further development of philosophy. The philosophers of\\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may have thought they\\nwere dealing with the theory of reality, but they were actually\\nforwarding the new natural science. They were engaged in\\ncriticizing science as it had come down in the Middle Ages from\\nAristotle. They were presenting the necessity for a different kind\\nof cosmology. In the eighteenth century, especially in France\\nduring the Enlightenment, and to some extent in England,\\nphilosophers attempted to do something of the same kind in human and\\nsocial subjects, but the materials and tools were lacking. They\\ngot rid of many things, but their constructive activities never\\namounted to so much. I think that now we have potentially the\\nintellectual resources that would enable philosophy to do\\nsomething of the same kind for the forwarding of human and social\\nsubjects. The older physical science, after stripping away the\\nanimistic survivals, had no concern with human problems. This\\nscience was about little lumps of matter which were separated from\\none another, existing in external space and time, which were\\nthemselves separated from each other and from everything that\\nhappened. Physical science has nearly demolished that point of\\nview. The material of the physical world is such that, through the\\nincreasing applications in physiology and biology, it isn\\'t so\\nfixedly set over against human concerns as it used to be. Science\\nitself has got rid of matter, in the old sense. But this does not\\n  \\n                            \\nmean that matter has become a background to be related to\\nhuman concerns, which could not happen as long as the\\nNewtonian view prevailed.\\nThere are many obstacles in realizing the hope I speak of. One\\nvery serious obstacle is the state of the world now, which is so\\nfearful, so frightful, in the literal sense of the word, that it\\'s very\\nhard to face. The tendency is to look to some unreal solution to\\nits problems which is essentially reactionary—going back to the\\nideas of Greek or medieval times, or in philosophy to adopt a\\nmethod of escape because we don\\'t seem to be able to handle the\\nactual problems, which, if we are at the beginning of a new\\nepoch, would probably take centuries to work out effectively.\\nThe most discouraging thing in philosophy is neo-scholastic\\nformalism, which also happened in the Middle Ages. It is form\\ntoday for its own sake, in so many cases. A form of forms, not\\nforms of subject matter. But the subject matter is so chaotic and\\nconfused today in the world that it is difficult to handle. This\\nis how I would explain this retreat from work in the facts of\\nhuman life into purely formal issues—I hesitate to call them issues\\nbecause nothing ever issues except more form! It\\'s harmless\\nfor everyone except philosophers. This retreat accounts for the\\ngrowing disinterest of the general public in the problems of\\nphilosophy.\\nTotalitarianism, the attempt to find a complete set of\\nblueprints that will settle every question, is another form of reaction,\\nand a much more dangerous form. We have seen this in fascism\\nand now today, in my opinion, in bolshevism.\\nIt takes considerable courage to see into the present situation.\\nTo see it through will be the work of a long period. But the hope\\nfor philosophy will be that it will take part in the initiation of\\nmovements that will be carried through by human activity.\\nThe first step is to see as frankly as possible the kind of world\\nthat we are living in and that which is likely to come. We should\\nat least turn our eyes toward it and face it even if we can\\'t do\\nmuch with our hands and muscles about it. But what we should\\nnot do is to spin a lot of webs to operate as screens to keep us\\nfrom seeing the reality of the situation. In this respect, formalism\\nmay be a hopeful sign. It may be the beginning of a general\\nrecognition that philosophers weren\\'t getting anywhere dealing\\nwith matter at large, as with some ultimate entity. This reaction\\n  \\n                            \\nmight be the opening of a more serious attempt to face the\\ncultural problems of today. Science has done away with so many of\\nthe dualisms of the last few centuries, mind and matter, the\\nindividual and society, etc. These are simply echoes that once had a\\nvitality because of cultural conditions. We are growing out of\\nthese. We need to have an idea of a systematic kind of what we\\nmight grow into.\\nPhilosophy can\\'t settle these issues any better than seventeenth\\ncentury philosophy could settle problems of physics, but today\\nphilosophers can analyze problems and present hypotheses that\\nmight gain enough currency and influence to serve so that they\\ncould be tested by the only final method of testing, which is\\npractical activity. (Applause.)\\nOne thing more, and that is—you who are students really have\\nas great an opportunity as any students of any subject ever had at\\nany time, but it will take a lot of patience, a lot of courage, and, if\\nI may say so, considerable guts!\\n  \\n                            \\n^What Is Democracy? [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 55, folder 3, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1946(?).]\\n»»\\nAt no time in the past has the world faced as many and\\nas serious problems as at the present time. For at no past time has\\nthe world in which man lives been so extended and so\\ncomplicated in its interconnected parts. This statement is made,\\nhowever, not for its own sake but as an introduction to the aspect of\\nthe world\\'s problems that will be here considered. The recent\\nhistorical scene would have been regarded as impossible not\\nmore than half a century ago. For at that time the progressive\\ntriumph of democracy, both as an idea of political philosophy\\nand as a political fact, seemed fairly assured. Of late years its\\nvery existence has been so challenged that its fate seemed to hang\\nin the balance and even now its future is far from settled. The\\nfirst attack made upon it was open, unconcealed. The military\\nassault of Japan, Italy, and Germany and their satellites was\\nattended and supported by the ever-repeated charge that the\\ndemocratic ideal had outlived its usefulness, and that new and\\ndifferent order was urgently required.\\nThe nations that made the military attack suffered a crushing\\ndefeat. The present state of the world proves, without need\\nfor extended argument, that the underlying ground of social,\\neconomic, and political principles is far from being crushed. The\\nstruggle between democratic beliefs as they have been\\nunderstood and put into practice in the past is more overt and acute\\nthan before or during the military conflict. The question \"What\\nis Democracy?\" is not in the existing state of the world\\'s affairs\\nan academic question. Nor at present is it a matter of defending\\ndemocratic principles and policies against attack by those\\nwho openly, avowedly, treated them with complete scorn. The\\n  \\n                            \\nconflict is now between two radically different, completely\\nopposed, systems each of which claims to be faithful to the cause of\\ndemocracy.\\nA conflict which is of direct practical importance to hundreds\\nof millions of people and upon which the issue of world-wide war\\nor peace may depend is not a theoretical question to be settled by\\nthe arguments of political scientists. One of the national states\\nwhich was an ally of the states that represent democracy as it has\\nbeen traditionally understood and practiced now engages in an\\nattack upon the latter which is both ideological and diplomatic\\nand which, by common consent, might pass into strife of armed\\nforces. For it accuses the traditionally democratic peoples of the\\nWest in Europe and America of betraying the cause of democracy\\nand holds itself up as representing in its policies and\\nprinciples the fulfillment of the democratic idea now misrepresented\\nand betrayed by peoples who profess democracy but who fail\\nto carry it into practice in one very important part of human\\nrelationships.\\nThat part is, of course, that of human relations as they ^are\\naffected by the economic order, by the conditions under which\\nindustry and finance are conducted. However, I do not intend to\\ndiscuss the conflict as if its focus and centre is primarily located\\nin the matter of economic policies. It is my belief, for instance,\\nthat economic policies have been in the past the weakest aspect\\nof traditional western democracies. Nor do I propose to defend\\nthese democracies on the ground that each one of them, not\\nexcluding the United States which has perhaps been the country\\nthe most attached to an \"individualistic\" economic order, is\\nactively modifying in its own behalf its traditional economic system.\\nThe fact that \"capitalism\" is so far from being a rigidly fixed\\nsystem that in fact it is in almost a fluid state is pertinent to some of\\nthe charges brought against this and other western democracies\\nbut not to the issue I am discussing;—namely, what is the centre\\nand the foundation of the democratic idea and policies?\\nThis centre and base is, in my judgment, thrown into clear and\\nimpressive relief by the fact that the nation from which the\\nassaults now proceed has taken over and improved upon the\\ngeneral totalitarian philosophy and practice, one species of which it\\nwas actively fighting only a few years ago—and which in fact is\\nhistorically continuous with the anti-democratic history of its\\n  \\n                            \\nown political past. For this totalitarianism reveals with startling\\nclearness that the central issue is that of respect for freedom of\\nintelligence versus disrespect for it so great as to amount to its\\neffective denial and suppression when it stands, even passively, in\\nthe way of political-economic totalitarian policy.\\nThat no professedly democratic country has in the past been\\nwithout flaw in its devotion to freedom of intelligence as carried\\nout in freedom of the various ways in which it is publicly\\nmanifested is of course true. In my own country, for example, its Bill\\nof Rights inserted there by the efforts of our first great and\\ntypical Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, is a guarantee of freedom of\\nspeech, writing, publication, and assembly for discussion, with\\nrespect to all public issues. Moreover, the Supreme Court of the\\nFederation was charged in effect with ability to declare null and\\nvoid all laws passed by the political units of the Federation which\\ninfringed upon the working effectiveness of this guaranteed\\nfreedom of intelligence in operation. As I have suggested, we have\\nnot always lived up in times of trouble and stress to this\\nguarantee. But it is true that the idea is so embodied not just in the\\nwritten legal Constitution of the country but in the hearts and minds\\nof the people that every period of reaction has called out a\\nsuccessful period of protest and restoration.\\nThis last remark is not made for the purpose of defense much\\nless of a boast. It is made to indicate that this principle of respect\\nfor free intelligence in action goes so deep and extends so far that\\nit has to be continually re-asserted and re-invigorated as\\nconditions change. It is so far from being self-executing that in every\\nperiod of crisis it has to be actively fought for though, happily,\\nso far not by recourse to arms. The present assault made by a\\nstate in the interest of policies executed by totalitarian methods\\nof violent (as well as ideological opposition) suppression of\\nany departure in press, literature, public assembly, even private\\nconversations, and even conduct of physical and biological\\ninquiries, from officially established totalitarian doctrines, points\\nto maintenance of free intelligence in public operation as the\\nfocal issue in the various problems of intelligence.\\nAnother great American democrat, Abraham Lincoln, left as\\nhis heritage the statement that democracy is Government of, for,\\nand by the people. I have italicized the preposition \"by\" because\\ngovernment cannot possibly be by the people save when and\\n  \\n                            \\nwhere the freedom of intelligence is publicly and actively\\nsupported. It is debatable whether it can for any long period be for\\nthe people and not for a governing clique or bureaucracy save\\nwhere the rights of public discussion and criticism are held\\ninviolate. Revolutionary periods, of which from a world-wide point of\\nview the present is one, tend toward a concentration of power.\\nThe concentration claims for itself that it is in the best interests of\\nthe people at large. At the outset, that may be the case in fact. But\\nnothing is more certain than unless its movement is attended by\\nscrupulous attentive observance of the principle of freedom of\\nintelligence in action it will rapidly degenerate into the rule of a\\nsmall section, maintained by use of force, in its own special\\ninterest. It is for this reason that it is so peculiarly, almost uniquely,\\nimportant at the present time not to be distracted into allowing\\nany issue, no matter how useful in itself, to displace freedom of\\nintelligence in public communication by means of speech,\\npublication in daily and weekly press, in books, in public assemblies,\\nin scientific inquiry, as the centre and burning focus of\\ndemocracy. Nothing will be more fatal in the end than surrender and\\ncompromise on this point. Now, more than ever, it is urgently\\nnecessary to hold it in steady view as the heart from which flows\\nthe life-blood of democracy.\\nI should not close without definite recal of the fact that it was\\nthe pioneers of freedom of thought and speech in France in the\\neighteenth century, who in spite of every sort of interference by\\nthose professing to speak in the name of moral authority and\\nsocial stability made that century the period of The\\nÉclaircissement, The Enlightenment, out of which has issued all that is best\\nand truest in the democratic spirit first in the civilization of the\\nWest and now in promise if not yet in execution of the entire\\nworld. If the peoples who have behind them and still with them\\nthe living tradition of supreme and steady regard for freedom of\\nintelligence in operation in all channels of communication now\\nlive up to their heritage, they, we, shall issue from the present\\ncrisis with purification of the life-blood of democracy. In\\nsurmounting the cruel trials of the present crisis we shall have\\nopened the way to a nobler, because freer, manifestation of the\\nhuman spirit.\\n  \\n                            \\nEducation for a New and Better World [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 54, folder 8, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.]\\n»»\\nThere has probably never been a time in all history when\\nthe world was as disturbed as it is today. For one thing however\\ntroubled the world has been in the past, it was smaller; there\\nwasn\\'t so much of a world to be pulled in different directions and\\nin doubt both about where it is going and where it should go.\\nThere was a time when men sailed on ponds and lakes. The\\nwaters might be agitated; those who were caught in the storm\\nwere badly troubled; perhaps they perished. But after all the\\nshock was local. Today we are on a trackless sea; and there\\nare no merely local storms. For good or for evil we are bound\\ntogether:—That no one lives to himself is not a moral precept\\nany longer; it is a literal statement of a terrifying fact. Whether it\\nwill always remain terrifying, or whether it can be transformed\\ninto a promise of a new and better world is perhaps the most\\nunsettled and most uncertain of all the disturbing things of the\\nworld in which we now live. What we are going to do with the\\npower put at our disposal by the broken atom and what it is\\ngoing to do with us, whether it is to be used for destruction or\\nfor creation confronts us as a symbol of our present world-wide\\nstate.\\nI sometimes think that we people of the older generation\\nshould be ashamed to look the younger generation in the face in\\nview of the kind of world we are turning over to them in which to\\nlive. It seems at times as if all the responsibilities we had shirked,\\nall the opportunities we had missed, as well as all the mistakes\\nwe have made were the chief heritage we are bequeathing to\\nthose who come after us and who have to live in the world we are\\npassing on to them. But nothing can deprive the young of the\\n  \\n                            \\ninalienable gift of youth, and of the vigor and the fresh outlook\\nthat are a part of that g[ift.] In a way the world begins over again\\nas every new generation enters the field. The scene about them is\\na challenge to courage and to energy. And it is especially at the\\npresent time a challenge to patience and endurance, to fortitude\\nand resolution. We are at one of the turning points in history. As\\nour ^most beloved American said at a crisis in our own history we\\nshall either greatly win or meanly lose. The only thing that in the\\nend can be fatal is the cowardice that refuses to make a choice as\\nto the kind of world we want to live in and that withdraws from\\na struggle to bring it in existence.\\nAmid all the disturbances and uncertainties there is one thing\\nwhich is constant and which is the same everywhere. There has\\nnever been a time in history when education had the importance\\nin shaping the life of the future that it has ^now. That means that\\nthere was never a time when the direction taken by the ideas and\\nideals, the choices and efforts of the young, had the importance\\nthey have now. It was never as plain as it is now that schooling is\\nat most but a part of education; that education includes\\neverything that shapes what men really believe, what they most desire,\\nwhat they are loyal to; the purposes for which they strive and for\\nwhich they are willing to sacrifice. Schooling is important but its\\nwork hardly goes beyond furnishing the tools, the instruments,\\nwith which to strive for realization of the deep affections of the\\nheart and the steadfast and informed aims of the head. Youth\\nhave now to take a greater part in their own education than ever\\nbefore; education is nothing less than the making of character\\nand of mind and the prime question is whether the young are\\ngoing to have their characters and minds made for them by\\noutside pressures or they are going to have an active share\\nthemselves in the making of the world in which they will live. And if I\\nmay quote a saying of ^another great American at a critical time,\\n\"the only thing we have to fear is fear.\" Man still has it in his\\npower to shape his own destiny. Just now he is disturbed and\\nembarrassed not because of weakness but because he is\\ntemporarily so overpowered by what he has accomplished in a short\\ntime that he hasn\\'t time yet to learn what to do with them.\\nIt is this fact that gives special point to the question whether\\nthe youth of the world are to take an active part in the formation\\nof their own minds or characters, or whether they are to be putty\\n  \\n                            \\nto be shaped and moulded by those who arrogate to themselves\\nthe possession of the understanding and other means of creating\\nthe future. It is an aid when one is in a fog or in the dark to see\\nwhere the ways part; one can then at least choose the direction in\\nwhich he moves ahead. I have been reading recently the official\\ninstructions issued by the educational authorities of a great and\\npowerful nation to the teachers of that country regarding\\nthe intellectual and moral treatment of the youth who are put\\nin their charge. A typical passage reads: \"A morally educated\\nindividual is one who in his own conduct subordinates his own\\ninterests to the service of his Motherland and his people. Such\\nservice presupposes wrath and hatred toward the enemies of\\nthe Motherland.\" One may properly admire subordination of\\npersonal interests to the interests of the community. But when\\none finds that it has to be based on wrath and hatred and upon\\nconstant inculcation of the belief that one\\'s own community is\\nalready the \"leader of all mankind,\" \"the most advanced of all\\nmankind,\" that their own political leader \"is the leader of the\\nworkers of the entire world,\" and one finds how every detail\\nof teaching, discipline, every sport, is systematically organized\\nfor production of a single pattern of thought and action, which\\nis protected by a steel armor of intolerance and hatred\\nagainst everything else, one may combine admiration for the\\nthoroughness with which every possible device and resource is\\nbrought into the service of education as a means of shaping\\nsociety, with profound doubt and disbelief regarding the kind of\\nsociety that can be formed by suppression of every idea, every\\nimpulse, every desire, every outside aspiration and purpose that\\ndeparts from a pattern formed and imposed from above.\\nHowever, I am not so much concerned here to express\\ncomplete repudiation of the controlling end and ideal of this scheme\\nfor my own country and for myself as I am to indicate the\\nparting of the ways of human life which is so extreme that choice\\nbetween them decides the direction in which education and\\nyouth will now move and what sort of a human world will exist\\nin the future.\\nThe more we respect the faith which totalitarian nations put in\\nthe power of education to give direction to people in a confused\\nand distracted world, the more we are bound to inquire what\\nsort of a world will result if there is success in moulding men and\\n  \\n                            \\nwomen into a single pattern based upon a single set of principles\\nassumed to embody final truth, the whole defended and\\nprotected by cultivation of hatred and wrath against everything that\\ndoes not conform and that makes a supreme virtue out of the\\nextreme use of violence and even systematic misrepresentation\\nthat are justified when they are used in behalf of the higher\\nmorality. And in asking this, we shall if we are intelligent,\\nask what is the alternative course and policy for education. If\\nwe are as serious, as earnest, as devoted to using education to\\nextend and deepen the realization of a free life as the rulers of\\ntotalitarian societies are to use it for production of the fixed\\npredetermined type of life they are set upon, what shall we try\\nto do, what shall our guiding principles be? These are large\\nquestions; too large to be answered offhand and too large for any of\\nus to be able to answer except by means of long continued\\ncooperative work.\\nBut a few things we can be sure of. We can be sure that the\\nworld\\'s need for a fuller and deeper free life cannot be achieved\\nby merely persisting in even the best of the democratic\\ninstitutions and practices of the past. New occasions and conditions\\nteach new duties. The only way in which the burning zeal,\\nthe ardor, which once animated, directed the efforts of\\nfreedom-loving peoples can be rekindled, and by which to attain a\\ndevotion and energy matching that manifested by those who\\nwould save the world by imposition of a single fixed pattern, is to\\nknow we cannot live off or upon the past no matter how fine its\\nvictories. Freedom of life is not something that can be preserved.\\nIt is something that has to be created and recreated. The more\\nmarked the change in conditions, the more urgent the need for\\nchange in the practices by which genuine free life can be\\nattained. The change in world conditions in the last half-century\\nalone is greater than all previous human history. Here is the\\nchallenge to courage, imagination, vital energy. ^For after all fear\\nis not our only enemy. Complacence and passivity stand in our\\nway. We need faith, but faith in ourselves and the possibility of\\nour making a better because freer world can be nourished into\\nenduring strength only as we put faith in intelligence. Invention\\nhas done wonders in the material world. Discovery and invention\\nare akin to the spirit of youth. The technical and industrial\\nmatters\\' continual movement into the new and the use of all\\n  \\n                            \\nmethods for exploring the new as we move in are the most\\nmarked features of the modern world. The open opportunity and\\nthe open task is now to use our vast scientific and technical\\nresources for discovery and invention of the ever-growing new in\\nthe things that are human. Imposition of fixed principles\\nmay have temporary appeal and may give temporary relief.\\nIn the long run—and perhaps not so very long—it marks\\nthe road to collision and explosion. Man is bewildered but not\\nso bewildered as to find for long security in chains.\\n  \\n                            \\nComment on Recent Criticisms of Some Points in Moral and Logical Theory [Typescript in the John Dewey Papers, Box 59, folder 5, Special Collections,\\nMorris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1950.]\\n»»\\nA variety of circumstances have made it virtually\\nimpossible for me to take proper account of criticisms passed upon\\none or another aspect of my philosophical views. In the present\\npaper two recent instances of criticism are selected for comment\\nbecause their respective subjects occupy a central position in the\\ntheory of method underlying my views on all philosophical\\ntopics thereby determining the type of conclusions reached. For this\\nreason, the present discussion will, I hope, be seen to have an\\nimportant bearing much beyond the limits of the especial points\\ntaken up for explicit consideration.\\nThe first matter discussed has to do with a point that is focal in\\nthe theory of morals as I have dealt with that subject in my\\nwritings. The particular criticism which is the occasion of these\\npresent comments is found in recent writings of Dr. Morton G.\\nWhite. They are concerned (with respect to their bearing upon\\nmy ethical views) with the method by means of which valid—in\\ncommonly accepted language, objectively sound—conclusions\\nare to be attained regarding what is good, right, morally\\nobligatory, etc., in human conduct. The special point, as distinct\\nfrom method in general, which is involved is the distinction\\nmade in my writings between that which is desired, a de facto\\nmatter, and what is desirable; that is, in my treatment, what\\nde jure should or ought to be desired. The specific criticisms\\nmade by Dr. White already have been so amply and so\\nadequately dealt with by Dr. Sidney Hook on the base of an\\nextensive and critically accurate knowledge of my writings that I have\\nonly as concerns the particular views ^criticized to refer interested\\n  \\n                            \\npersons to Dr. Hook\\'s discussion and express my deep and\\ngrateful appreciation. The article by Dr. Hook in the recent symposium volume edited by him, John\\nDewey: Philosopher of Science and Freedom, is entitled \"The Desirable and\\nEmotive in Dewey\\'s Ethics\" (pp. 194-216) with a running page heading\\n\"Dewey\\'s Ethical Theory.\" The part of the essay dealing with Dr. White\\'scriti-cism\\ncriticism will be found on pp. 200-207.\\n»1\\nSince the point about to be discussed concerns the question of\\nmethod of knowing and of reaching conclusions it covers ground\\nnot included in Dr. Hook\\'s discussion as it was not directly\\npertinent to the phase of Dr. White\\'s criticisms to which he replied.\\nAccordingly I cannot claim his assent to what I am going to say\\nthough I hope it will be found by him to agree with his own\\nposition on the subject under consideration. The\\nmethodological philosophical issue involved in Dr. White\\'s criticism of the\\ndistinction of kinds or type of judgment (propositional statement\\nif one prefers) between \"X is desired\" and \"X is desirable\"\\ncomes out most clearly in a passage (p. 206 of his essay) in which\\nDr. Hook engages in a brief consideration of \"one variant\" of\\nDr. White\\'s criticism to the effect that \"knowledge of the causes\\nand consequences of our desire and of what is desired does not\\nmake the desired desirable unless . . . we can get back to some\\nrock-bottom desirable in itself.\"\\nThe words I have taken the liberty of italicizing bring out very\\nclearly the fundamental difference between the methodological\\nposition of Dr. White and my own. I do not wish to attach\\nadjectives to Dr. White\\'s position with respect to method which he\\nmight wish to repudiate, although it is evident to me that\\ndependence upon that which is \"desirable in itself,\" that is in complete\\nindependence of and isolation from investigation of the\\nexistential context of \"conditions and consequences,\" involves the\\nassumption of what has been known in ethics as the method of\\nIntuition and in epistemology as the necessity of the A priori to\\nwarrant the validity of statements made on empirical grounds. At\\nall events, I can and do take this reference to this dependence\\nupon the \"desirable in itself\" as the only ground upon which a\\nvalid distinction can be made between the de facto \"desired\" and the\\nde jure \"desirable\" as a highly significant indication of the\\nmethodological ground for my emphasis upon investigation of\\n  \\n                            \\nconditions and consequences as the only way by which valid\\nstatements about the desirable can be reached. That is to say the\\ngeneral philosophical bearing and import of reference to\\nconditions and consequences is to bring ethical knowings and what\\nare to be the ethically known out of the domain of absolutes and\\nas far as concerns method identify the method of philosophical\\ninquiry in general and moral inquiries in particular with that\\nnow pursued as matter of course in scientific and technological\\nmatter: indeed in all non-philosophical matters. I do not\\nquestion, of course, the personal right of Dr. White to take the\\nposition which as I see it is an heritage from times when scientific\\nmethod as now practiced did not exist and when the rational as\\ndistinct from the observational had to be invoked to guarantee\\nthe validity of beliefs and statements. But I am entitled in my\\nown behalf to point out that the method employed in making the\\ndistinction between the de facto desired and the de jure desirable\\nis simply the method pursued in all sciences which conduct\\ninquiries intended to find out what is fact—\"objective\" fact to\\nindulge in a pleonasm—and in distinction from what is taken\\nto be fact apart from systematic inquiry into \"conditions and\\nconsequences.\"\\nThis last expression brings the present discussion to Dr. White\\'s\\nassertion that my distinction depends upon my having\\n\"generated a normative or de jure proposition by performing a suitable\\noperation on merely de facto propositions.\" Am I guilty of\\nreaching my distinction in the way here set forth I am certainly to be\\naccused of depending upon a variety of intellectual magic. The\\nstatement as made completely neglects however the conditions\\nwhich in my actual account provide an \"operation\" with a claim\\nto be \"suitable.\" In the first place, the operation is performed not\\non propositions but with them, by means of them; and in the\\nsecond place the propositions with which the \"desirable\" is\\ndetermined as normative or de jure, in distinction from de facto\\npropositions regarding things desired de facto, are the\\noutcomes of systematically conducted investigations, in distinction\\nfrom propositions casually picked up; and in the third place the\\n\"conditions and consequences\" involved are not just so many\\ncases of de facto desireds. The inquiries involved have to do with\\nan actually existent situation in which something needs to be\\ndone; which is of a kind in which not doing anything may be,\\n  \\n                            \\nin its consequences, the most fatal sort of doing—as when\\nby-standers stand idly by and allow a wounded man to bleed\\nto death.\\nI hope that even Dr. White would admit that the inquiries by\\nwhich the proposition \"the whale is a fish\" were transformed\\ninto the statement \"the whale is warmblooded\" (and hence not a\\nfish) did not consist of operations performed on any propositions\\nbut upon systematic deliberately conducted examination of the\\nantecedent conditions and the subsequent consequences of a\\nwhole set of activities characteristic of the behavior of whales.\\nDr. White\\'s reduction of the desirable to that which is desired\\n\"under normal conditions\" is wholly satisfactory to me provided\\nthe literally terrible ambivalence in normal is cleared away—\\nwhich I do not find he even tries to do. \"Normal\" in the sense of\\nwhat happens usually, on the average, etc., is certainly de facto.\\nThe statement that \"X is objectively red\" is not, if \"objective\"\\nhas any distinctive import, of that kind. \"Normal\" conditions in\\nthe latter case have normative force; the conditions in question\\nare not those of a majority or even the total number of cases in\\nwhich X appears red. They are conditions instituted by\\ncontinued experimental inquiries conducted for a definite end-in-view.\\nWhen this fact is recognized, I welcome the formal or\\nmethodological identification of the statement \"X is desirable\" with \"X\\nis objectively red,\" for if \"objective\" has any distinctive relevant\\nsense in the latter proposition, that sense, like that of \"normal\"\\nas having any relevance to the point at issue in the phrase\\n\"normal conditions,\" is itself intrinsically normative or de jure. I\\nwelcome Dr. White\\'s identification when its direction is completely\\nreversed. All scientifically grounded propositions, those reached\\nby inquiry satisfying the conditions imposed by what the word\\n\"scientific\" names and stands for, are normative propositions;\\nexactly as, for a final example, \"X is objectively red\" signifies\\nthat the case in question fulfills, satisfies the conditions that are\\nconstituted by a definitive standard of a certain number of waves\\nof a certain spatial length occurring in a specified unit of time.\\nThere are de facto and empirical propositions having to do with\\nwhat has existed and with what now is observed to exist.\\nStatements that a given thing is desired, whether once or a million of\\ntimes, are of this de facto kind or variety. The statement that a\\nthing is desirable, that it should be desired, is de facto with\\n  \\n                            \\nrespect not to what has existed or now exists but in reference to the\\nactivity which is required to bring it into existence. It too is an\\nempirical proposition but only as \"empirical\" in this case is\\nidentical with the experimentally determined. Unfortunately, or\\nperhaps fortunately, \"normal\" conditions for and of an experiment\\nthat yields a warranted conclusion do not lie around nor force\\nthemselves upon us. They are obtained by undertaking the kind\\nof activities which the best available knowledge at the time\\ninforms us should be tried in order to find out their specific\\nconsequences in and for further knowing.\\n  \\n                            \\nPedagogy:—Memorandum [Mimeograph memorandum (1894?) to President William Rainey Harper,Presi-dents\\'\\nPresidents\\' Papers, 1889-1925, Special Collections, the Joseph Regenstein Library,\\nUniversity of Chicago.]\\n»»\\nIf the work undertaken and planned in psychology and\\nethics is to be what it should be, it is highly important that it be\\nclosely related to work in pedagogy. Even if the opportunity for a\\ndepartment in pedagogy were not (as it is in my judgment) the\\nmost promising of any now offered to a University—especially in\\nthe west—it is a practical necessity in order to give practical\\nillustrations of checks upon the work in Psychology and Ethics.\\nOn the other hand, the work thus far done in Pedagogy in this\\ncountry has been comparatively useless; it has been mechanical\\nand vague because separated from psychology and social ethics,\\nor else an artificial deduction from a purely deductive\\npsychology. Ethics and Psychology are to Pedagogy, rightly undertaken,\\nwhat the theoretical study of scientific principles is to work in a\\nlaboratory. Both suffer equally from division. Even in Europe\\nthey have not except at ^Jena begun to realise the possibilities of\\nwork in education. It is possible to go much further in this\\ncountry than even at Jena, because in the absence of central official\\norganization here, the tendency to turn to the University for the\\nguidance there got from the Government is strong and growing\\nevery day.\\nIt is my honest and firm conviction that the American\\nUniversity which first sees rightly the existing situation in education and\\nacts upon the possibilities involved, will by that very fact\\ncommand the entire University situation. I also firmly and honestly\\nbelieve that Chicago is the most ripe place in America for\\nundertaking this work.\\n  \\n                            \\nDetails\\n1. An educational museum, that is, collections of\\napparatus, charts, books illustrating teaching of subjects; plans,\\narchitecture, etc., of schools, etc., etc.\\n2. A staff, at first of two or three, ultimately of five or six\\nspecialists in various directions and at the same time with personal\\nknowledge of public school work. This staff to divide their time\\nbetween visiting schools, reporting on their work, giving them\\nsuggestions, etc., and lecturing in the University on methods of\\nteaching in their particular branch.\\na. This will bring University into direct contact with\\npreparatory schools. The advantages of this do not need to be\\nstated. Even such an occasional visiting of schools by a\\ncommittee, a day or two at a time, in Michigan, has turned students\\ngreatly in that direction; besides, it has given the University a\\nhold on the school curriculum. If such results have been got in\\nthis unsystematic way, we might be hopeful as to the results of\\nregular organization.\\nb. It would ensure real and practical teaching in methods. The\\npresent tendencies in University chairs of pedagogy to vague and\\nunrelated theorizing would be made impossible.\\nc. Advanced students could be taken out on the visits and\\nstudy educational conditions at first hand.\\nd. The University would get into such connection with the\\nschools as to be able to recommend teachers more directly and\\nsystematically and thus not only afford an outlet for its teachers,\\nbut get a direct supervision over and control of school methods.\\n3. A practice or experimental school, such as now exist at\\nJena and Columbia, extending ultimately from kindergarten\\nclear up.\\nThe need of this is self-evident. As to its cost, it could be\\nstarted in a small way, and with no expense to the University,\\nbeing officially unconnected, yet with the encouragement of the\\nUniversity authorities and under the control of the department of\\nphilosophy. As it grew, it could finally be officially assimilated to\\nthe University.\\nThis is the ultimate flower of the whole scheme. Existing\\nUniversities and even Normal Schools are simply training individual\\nteachers. The advance will come by joining this to a direct\\nreaction upon and readjustment of the existing school.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe Russian School System [Address delivered at Leon Mandel Hall, University of Chicago, 21 February\\n1929. Stenographic report in the Anita McCormick Blaine Papers, StateHistori-cal\\nHistorical Society of Wisconsin, Madison.]\\n»»\\nTHE CHAIRMAN: To many of us here this evening, this is\\nan occasion not only of intellectual interest but of a very deep\\nand personal interest. We have come, on the one hand, to hear\\nimportant news and interpretations of Russia. We have also\\ncome to welcome a beloved teacher and colleague and neighbor\\nand citizen and friend.\\nWe are aware, of course, that to present him in a mere setting\\nof our local interests would be a bad case of myopia, and would\\ndistort the whole perspective. As I said the other day, in\\npresenting Mr. Dewey as a philosopher, no institution, no university, no\\ncommunity, and I might even go so far as to say no nation, has\\nan exclusive claim on him.\\nIf we were to attempt to press that claim there would be, as I\\nsaid, protests all along the line, from China and Japan, and from\\nMexico and South America, and from Turkey and Russia; even\\nsome of the more backward peoples, such as members of the\\nUnited States Senate (laughter), and the members of the English\\nParliament are showing some signs of recognizing his world-\\nwide citizenship.\\nIn presenting him this evening as an educator, all of this holds\\nwith increased force. It was not as a technical philosopher, but as\\na philosophical educator that Mr. Dewey came to have the world\\nfor his parish. It was his Essays in Experimental Logic and his\\nvolume on Leibnitz, and his Experience and Nature, and that\\nlittle yellow book called School and Society, which was\\ntranslated into French and German and Spanish and Chinese and\\nJapanese and Turkish and Czechish.\\nIn spite of illustrious precedence to the contrary from Plato\\n  \\n                            \\ndown, there are still people who think if you talk of a man as a\\nphilosopher and an educationalist that you are accusing him of\\nleading a double life. And they are usually quite sure that they\\nknow which is Dr. Jekyll and which is Mr. Hyde. These people,\\nof course, usually are those who still cherish the old cloister and\\nmonastic conception of philosophy, what we might call the\\n\"sedative\" conception of philosophy.\\nThose of us who know Professor Dewey\\'s philosophy know\\nthat it is not sedative; that it is a challenge and a call; that instead\\nof rendering us insensitive to the ills and sorrows of our\\nterrestrial life, it is a call to attack their source, and try to substitute\\nfor them more permanent and more generally distributed goods.\\nHence, therefore, the very close connection between such a\\nphilosophy and education.\\nI once heard Professor Dewey say—I do not know, but I think\\nhe would still subscribe to it—that the chief justification for\\nphilosophy was to be found in what philosophy had to contribute to\\na statement of the aims and methods of education.\\nIt is therefore, with a good conscience and a glad heart that I\\npresent to you the one and inseparable John Dewey, the\\neducational philosopher, and John Dewey, the philosophical educator.\\n(Applause.)\\nLadies and Gentlemen: In addition to expressing my great\\npleasure at having a ^renewed relationship with the University of\\nChicago, after a period of about a quarter of a century of\\ninterruption, I wish on this occasion of the ^William Vaughn Moody\\nLectureship, to state also the great satisfaction that it is to me\\nthat this particular phase of the taking up of old ties should be\\nconnected with the name and memory of my ^former colleague\\nand friend. I want also in that to include the satisfaction that it\\ngives me to be associated in any way with also my old-time\\nfriend, Mrs. Vaughn Moody.\\nThe problem of trying to give in a short time any picture of\\nRussian education possesses almost insuperable difficulty; and\\nalmost every time I attempt to speak of it, I am amazed at my\\nown rashness in attempting a task which is practically impossible\\nof execution, for Russia is a very large country—I need not\\nremind you—one larger than the United States.\\nI have a Russian friend in New York who said, fortunately\\n  \\n                            \\nperhaps for our relations—this was before I had ever been to\\nRussia, but I had talked about it—he said: \"I have been in the United\\nStates ten years, and I know the English language pretty well,\\nand I have had pretty wide contacts, but I would not venture\\nto attempt to make any general statements about the United\\nStates.\" Here I find myself, with no knowledge of the language,\\nthe Russian language, and after a very short stay there,\\nattempting something which, as he said, seemed to him a matter of very\\ngreat temerity, as he would not think of undertaking it about this\\ncountry, where he had lived for ten years. My excuse, if any is\\nneeded, is that the educational situation there is such an\\nenormously interesting one, and it presents so many features which, if\\nnot novel taking them separately one by one, are certainly novel\\ntaken in their union, in their combination, in their synthesis; that\\nthere is really something new being contributed to the world\\nin educational ideals, educational theory, and also educational\\npractice; and—something of which I am sure—if they are\\nsuccessful in the generation that is coming in carrying the\\ndevelopment further, will be something from which the whole world will\\nbe glad to learn educationally.\\nThe large part of the difficulty of giving anything like an\\nadequate account, or even one coherent enough to be interesting,\\nregarding education, is the fact that in the whole principle and\\nidea they are trying to break down the traditional isolation of the\\nschool from life outside the school, and to make the school\\nactivities dovetail at every point into the social, political, economic,\\ncultural life without. Therefore, to apprehend, grasp the nature\\nof the school system in its real significance, one really ought to\\nhave a considerable initiation, preparatory initiation with\\nreference to the social conditions, tendencies, problems and aims of\\nRussian life itself. Not merely the small time at my disposal but\\nmy own ignorance forbids me from going into that matter.\\nIn the short time that I was there, I had no contact with\\npoliticians or economists; no time for anything, opportunity for\\nanything but contact with pupils and teachers and the various lines\\nof cultural activity. And so I saw but one side of Russian life, and\\nthat in my own opinion the brighter and more hopeful side of the\\nRussian situation.\\nI am, however, going to refer to one element in the\\nbackground which I think has a good deal to do with the ideals,\\n  \\n                            \\nmethods of the present school system. A few weeks ago, after my\\nreturn, I was reading the memoirs of the ^French Ambassador at\\nthe Court of what was first St. Petersburg, then Petrograd, now\\nLeningrad; a man who had been there some time, was there\\nduring the outbreak of the war, and who remained after the\\nKerensky revolution. And his memoirs are very largely,\\npractically exclusively, in the form of a diary, giving the news taken\\nday by day; a very cultivated, intelligent, trained observer, with\\nthat lucidity of statement and detachment of powers of\\nobservation which are so characteristic of the Frenchman.\\nThe particular extract from him that I want to read is\\nsomething that he jotted down in his diary on the 2nd of June 1915.\\nThe date is somewhat important, because that meant that the\\nwar was then less than a year old, which is very significant in\\nconnection with what I am going to read. His account is an\\naccount of an interview with a ^man who at that time was a great\\nindustrialist, capitalist, manager of men and materials in Russia.\\nAnd here is what this man said less than a year after the outbreak\\nof the war.\\nThe days of Tsarism are numbered. The Tsarism is lost,\\nlost beyond hope. But Tsarism is the very framework of\\nRussia, and the sole point of unity for the nation. Revolution is\\nnow inevitable. It is only waiting for a favourable\\nopportunity. An opportunity will come. It doesn\\'t make any\\ndifference how, what starts it. But a revolution isn\\'t the worst peril\\nthreatening Russia, for a revolution strictly speaking is only\\nthe substitution of one political system for another by\\nviolence. A revolution can be of great benefit to a country, if it\\ncan reconstruct after having destroyed.\\nBut with us a revolution can only be destructive, because\\nthe educated class is only a tiny minority without\\norganization, political experience, or contact with the masses. To my\\nmind that is the greatest crime of Tsarism; it will not tolerate\\nany centre of political life and activity outside its own\\nbureaucracy. When this goes down in revolution, the whole\\nRussian State will dissolve. Undoubtedly it will be the\\nintellectuals and the bourgeois who will give the signal for the\\nrevolution, thinking they\\'re saving Russia; but from the\\nbourgeois revolution, we shall at once descend to the\\n  \\n                            \\nworking class revolution; soon after to the peasant revolution, and\\nthen will begin the most frightful anarchy, interminable\\nanarchy—ten years at least of complete chaos.\\nAnyone who reads this book, written by a rather conservative\\nand exceedingly skilful observer, will get a picture of the\\ncontinuous disorganization and disintegration of all Russian life, in\\nits political, economic, as well as its military features, going on\\nprogressively through the war. And when you have such a\\nstatement as this, when the war has been going on only a year, I think\\nthe greatest wonder is that the country held together and\\ncontinued to fight at all for as long a period as it did.\\nI think anyone who takes into account such statements of the\\nbackground as come here from an observer who, if he was\\nprejudiced at all, was prejudiced on the conservative side, will get a\\npoint of view from which to understand the Russian revolution,\\nwhich is absolutely impossible to get if we take merely what\\nhappened in 1917, and in the immediately succeeding year. This\\nunderstanding would not lead one to justify or apologize for\\neverything that was done, but he would see it as historically\\nspeaking, humanly speaking, almost inevitable.\\nThere was just one point where this prophecy is in error, and\\nthat is in assuming that the period of chaos and anarchy would\\ncontinue for at least ten years. The one thing that this great\\nRussian millionaire and industrialist did not see was that there was a\\ngroup, and particularly a man like Lenine, where there was\\nsufficient will to power and sufficient discipline, at least to bring\\norder, external order, and internal tranquility out of the\\nsituation, in a very much shorter time.\\nWith that we have to remember the historic, not simply the\\nlack of political experience, training of any sort, on the part of\\nthe masses of the people, but also the historic passivity of the\\nRussians. If you know Russian history, you know that practically\\nevery change in Russia has come to Russia from without, and in\\na way has been passively received by the people, though in time\\nthey have made it over to suit themselves.\\nBut there is not a single thing in their political system, their\\nmilitary system, their educational system up to the last few years,\\ntheir economic activities, their religion and so on, art, that did\\nnot come to them from without. In that sense they are almost\\n  \\n                            \\nunique in not having an active development of indigenous\\ninstitutions coming out of the people themselves.\\nIn saying this, of course I recognize that gradually they made\\nover what they took from without, and adapted it to their own\\nconditions. But there was a passivity, as well as lack of\\nexperience, which made it very easy for them to lend themselves to the\\nrule of a comparatively small minority, as long as that minority\\ncould give the country the peace, the order, the tranquility that it\\nneeded to recover from the very devastating years of the great\\nwar, from the equally devastating years of civil war, and the\\ncriminal blockade which followed.\\nIt is impossible for one who has not been there to realize what\\nthe suffering, misery, starvation, chaos of the people was, that\\nhas been produced by this period of war, external as well as\\ninternal, added to the foreign blockade when the population was\\nalready starving from lack of food. And this is not merely a part\\nof the general background, but it has to do with the educational\\nactivities undertaken even in the hardest years by the new\\nregime, as soon as it came into power.\\nIt is an old story that every great revolution of recent times has\\nbeen accompanied by very large educational reform. We have\\nthe same story for China. We have it in Turkey. We have it in\\nMexico. We have on a smaller scale the fact that public, popular\\neducation in Great Britain followed the ^Reform Bill. So that one\\nof the statesmen said: \"We now have to educate our new\\nmasters,\" the newly enfranchised population. With the overthrow of\\nthe Napoleonic regime in France in 1870 and \\'71, there was a\\ncomplete reformation of the educational system there. So it was\\nnatural to expect that some kind of an educational movement\\nwould follow. But the particular form and direction which that\\nnew educational movement took, was, of course, stimulated by\\nthe peculiar character of the new regime and its Socialistic ideals,\\nand its determination to make the working class, the laboring\\nclass, the supreme element in the formation and control of the\\nnew state.\\nIn the words I quote from a Russian educator belonging to the\\nCommunistic party, typical of the spirit in which this educational\\nenterprise went on, ^\"The laboring people must themselves build\\nthe structure of their own lives.\" Without education, without\\nschooling, any attempt of the working class to build a new social\\n  \\n                            \\norder, a new structure for their own lives, was obviously\\nabsurdly out of the question.\\nIn reading such a small part of Russian educational literature\\nas is available in English, there are certain formulas that re-\\nappear. They are a part, as it were, of the slogans of the\\neducational leaders, namely that it is the work of the schools to\\ndevelop warriors and builders of the new social order. In the words\\nof Lenine, which are often quoted, the business of education is\\n^\"to lead the entire population toward socialism; to direct the\\ncreation of a new social order, the schools must serve as teachers\\nand guides and leaders of the laboring and exploited classes in\\nthe work of social reconstruction.\"\\nOne phase of the new undertaking was what they called ^\"The\\nliquidation of illiteracy.\" In 1927, sixty-eight per cent according\\nto the available statistics of the Soviet Union was still illiterate.\\nAnd considering the much greater literacy of the urban\\npopulation, this meant that at least four out of five of the peasants could\\nneither read nor write. And the rural population is itself eighty\\nper cent, or four out of five, of the entire population.\\nNow, you can readily see two things. First, that if these people\\nwho are trying to create a new social and economic order took\\ntheir work at all seriously, or thought they had the slightest\\nchance of success, they were compelled by mere force of\\ncircumstances to devote enormous attention to the creation of a new\\neducational system. And the other thing equally obvious is the\\nenormous obstacles, the very great difficulties, that they had to\\ncontend with.\\nAs for this mere matter of getting rid of adult illiteracy, the\\ncampaign went on very actively. Whether one calls it successful\\nor not depends upon how much one expected, and what one\\nthought of the obstacles that had to be met. But by 1927, the\\nlatest time to which exact statistics are available, some seven\\nmillion of adults previously illiterate had got at least the tools of\\nlearning. In the whole Soviet Union, about a million and a half of\\nadult illiterates are added to the literate class every year, about a\\nlittle more than half that number being in Old Russia, Great\\nRussia.\\nI want to quote again from Lenine, because it gives a little\\nofficial, formal sanction to this view that they themselves recognize\\nthe schools as the central strategic factor in the situation. ^\"The\\n  \\n                            \\nlaboring masses are trained to knowledge because it is\\nindispensable to their victory. Nine-tenths of them recognize that\\nknowledge is the necessary tool in the struggle for freedom; that our\\nfailures are mostly due to lack of education. We must as a matter\\nof necessity make enlightenment accessible to all.\" And as they\\nare fond of saying themselves, exactly as the old regime of the\\nCzars rested on the ignorance of the masses which made it\\npossible, so the new regime could be possible only by the\\nenlightenment of the masses.\\nIn another speech he said: ^\"An illiterate man is wholly outside\\nof politics. Before he can be in at all, he must be taught the\\nalphabet. Without at least the knowledge of the alphabet and the ability\\nto read, there is no politics, only rumors, gossip and superstition.\"\\nThis attempt to bring reading and writing to the masses, to the\\nadults, of course is simply one phase of the matter which I refer\\nto as illustrating the sense that they had of their problem. But\\nbefore I go on to the schools proper, I want to say a few more\\nwords about what we would call adult education, what they call\\npolitical enlightenment. Civic enlightenment would perhaps be a\\nbetter English term, because although political activity in the\\nnarrower sense is part of it, it is somewhat broader than that.\\nThis political enlightenment is a recognized part of the central\\nsystem of education. At the head of it is ^Lenine\\'s widow, who\\ndirects the formation and execution of this general policy of adult\\neducation among the people. It is supposed to run through the\\nwhole population. I will speak of it merely as it is found in the\\nvillages because, as I said, that is the important part of Russian\\nlife, numerically and in their occupation.\\nIn the plan every single village is to have a centre, what is\\ncalled the village cottage reading room. And in certain centres,\\nsome of the larger villages, they have developed what are called\\nPeople\\'s Houses. That is, some have already developed them, and\\nothers plan to develop them. This is to be a sort of social\\nsettlement, in our language, for the whole village. The work of\\nteaching adults to read and write is carried on. It is a library centre; a\\ncentre for newspapers, where those who can read have access to\\nthem; where there is somebody to read aloud the newspapers to\\nthose who cannot read, and where in theory, and where the plan\\nis better carried out, in practice, there are regular meetings for\\nlectures. It is a forum for discussion, for concerts, all of the\\nthings that would improve the cultural life of the village.\\n  \\n                            \\nThese are under the control of committees, soviets as they call\\nthem. The soviet is not a Bolshevist invention. It almost means a\\ncommittee in the village, something like the old-fashioned New\\nEngland town meeting. But most any consultation is at least a\\ntemporary soviet. When our party was over there, ^twenty-five or\\nthirty of us going around, the meal hours were somewhat\\nirregular, and there would be a discussion as to what to do next, or\\nwhen to have our dinner hour. The Russian interpreter would\\nsay: \"We better have a soviet to settle the matter.\" (Laughter.)\\nAny discussion almost is a soviet.\\nThese groups that control these cottage reading rooms are\\nsupposed to consist of representatives of the more enlightened\\npeasantry, the local doctor, the local teacher; and it is not what\\nwe might call a soft snap to be a teacher in Russia at present,\\nbecause every teacher besides teaching school is expected to\\nengage in some kind of social activity, or politically educative\\nactivity outside of school hours, representatives of the\\ncooperatives, of the professional union. There is a cooperative association\\nin practically every village. They are the representatives of the\\nlocal union, if there is an agricultural experimental station—\\nwhich has been very much increased; they existed back before\\nthe Revolution—and so on.\\nThe methods they officially classify under three heads,\\nagitation, propaganda and teaching. The official definition of\\nagitation as distinct from propaganda is that the appeal is mainly\\nemotional and through the medium of pictures, either verbal\\npictures or posters, or some kind of graphic reproduction dealing\\nwith rather immediate special issues. The corresponding\\ndefinition of propaganda is that the approach is more intellectual, and\\nthat it discusses principles and policies that are more continuous\\nof application. What is left over is called teaching. (Laughter.)\\nThere are about 25,000 of those cottage reading rooms now\\nestablished. You understand without my saying so, of course,\\nthey are very different in quality, some of them rather nominal,\\nperfunctory. Others of them are really active and carrying out\\nthe aims. Much depends, of course, upon the local interest and\\nlocal material.\\nThere are 125,000 adults—this is quite independent of the\\nilliteracy movement—who are engaged in what is called self-\\neducation. That is, they follow courses; you cannot call them\\nuniversity extension courses, but more of the type of clubs and\\n  \\n                            \\nclasses in our own social settlements. There are some 125,000\\nadults carrying on self-education either in the cities or country.\\nIn view of the much larger rural population, however, it is\\nsignificant that sixty per cent of these 125,000 are found in the cities\\nand only forty per cent in the country districts. It is also\\ninteresting that eighty-five per cent of the city population are engaged in\\nthe lines of political study, while in the country districts that\\nfigure descends to forty-five per cent. In the country there are fifty-\\nfive per cent engaged in what we would call professional\\neducation, which really means for the most part studying agriculture\\nand the improvement of local farming and orchards and poultry\\nraising and so on. Now these statistics are not very interesting\\nbut it shows the contrast; even now the number of adults\\ncarrying on these courses in the city is more than half of the total\\nnumber, in spite of their having only one-fifth of the population.\\nThat is significant of the very fundamental problem that the\\npresent regime has to face. As they recognize, and as all the\\nworld knows, the split between the city worker and the\\npeasantry, the interests and needs of the city worker, as the government\\ntakes care of them and favors the city workers over against the\\npeasant population and their needs, the relative disadvantage\\nwhich they are at, that is the greatest internal problem without a\\ndoubt which the present regime has to face; and probably, if one\\ncan prophesy at all, is the factor which more than anything else\\nwill determine the ultimate outcome of the present regime. One\\ncould almost use this situation in education as a text from which\\none could go on to explain a good deal of the whole economic\\nand political problems, the divisions within the Soviet Union at\\nthe present time.\\nI am not going to say much about the formal organization of\\nthe school system. It is a nine year system, instead of a twelve\\nyear system like ours, with two supplementary years in what\\nthey call technical, more specialized schools, of which not the\\nmost important perhaps, but the most urgent at the present time,\\nare the pedagogical technical high schools that are giving teacher\\ntraining, normal training. There are one hundred and ninety-two\\nto two hundred now of these altogether, not in all Russia but in\\nRussia proper.\\nAs you know, the Soviet Union is a federation, of which what\\nwe usually think of as Russia is only one part, and even that does\\n  \\n                            \\nnot include southern Russia or the part of Russia towards\\nPoland, which have their own independent governments, and their\\nown independent educational systems. I mean within the whole,\\nthey have their own autonomous governments like our state\\ngovernments.\\nBy their paper program, they do not expect to have universal\\ncompulsory education until 1933, and even then it will be simply\\nfor the first grade of the nine years, namely a four year school.\\nPersonally, I doubt very much whether they will be able to carry\\nout their plan for uniform compulsory education for even as\\nshort a period as four years, as early as 1933, because of the\\nenormous obstacles they have to face. I will not go into that, but\\nI do not think that their failure to do that, if they do fail, and it\\nseems to me they are almost bound to, will be any cause for\\npermanent discouragement.\\nThe point certainly more interesting to a general audience, or\\nanyway to people at large, is the general spirit of the schools. Of\\ncourse I did not understand Russian, but there were certain\\nwords repeated often enough, so that they impressed themselves\\neven on dull ears like mine. The words we seemed to hear often\\nenough, and that came out oftener in the translations were:\\n\"Collectives,\" \"Communistic,\" as one might expect, \"Co-operative\"\\nand then \"Ideology\" and \"Culture.\"\\nI doubt if any discussion of a general nature could go on for\\nfifteen minutes in Russia without the introduction of the word\\nideology, the ideology of the bourgeois and the ideology of\\nRussia, and the ideology of the Bolshevist; the ideology of the\\nworking class, and so on. One can only sort of pick up just the\\nmeaning of it. It is of course the whole mental system and attitude,\\ntheir prevailing psychology, their mentality, the ideas, the\\nemotions that make themselves operative. Well, the general aim of\\nthis school system is not merely then to create literacy, and get a\\nbackground for citizenship able to participate actively in the\\ngovernment, but to create ideology appropriate to a social order in\\nwhich the interests of the working class are the supreme interests.\\nThis frequent introduction of the word \"culture,\"\\n\"cultivation,\" was to me in many ways the most surprising of the\\nexperiences, contacts which I had. I had a picture of Marxian socialism\\nas practically exclusively devoted to economic reform,\\nrevolution, or economic deformation, whatever your point of view may\\n  \\n                            \\nhappen to be; to concentrate on the purely economic and merely\\nmaterialistic features, especially as they call themselves always\\nmaterialists. It therefore was surprising, something of a shock, to\\nfind that they talked so much more about the necessity of the\\nspread of culture and cultivation, and the fact that the economic\\nrevolution was to provide the necessary basis, so that all of the\\ncommunity might have a share in culture, in science, and all the\\nvarious forms of art and all the kinds of civilized contact that\\nmake life worth while for everybody.\\nOne gets a sort of topsy-turvy, dizzy feeling when he finds this\\nsituation in a country that acknowledges itself to be very\\nbackward—as Lenine himself put it, in a condition of ^semi-Asiatic\\nbarbarism—reproaching one\\'s own country for lack of culture\\nor cultivation, because as they say or believe, our cultivation is so\\nlargely restricted to the class which is favorably placed. They say\\nthat no nation, and only with great difficulty can any individual\\nbe really a cultivated man, unless he is interested in sharing his\\ncultural advantages with everybody. In my opinion, this is the\\nnoblest, finest spirit, most highly idealistic element in the\\nsituation. Though in saying that, I do not mean to imply, of course,\\nthat it is the whole of the situation.\\nOne day we were visiting a ^colony eight or ten miles out of\\nMoscow. We had been going through the shops. We came out,\\nand one of the members of our party who knows Russian called\\nattention to a sign: \"Workmen, unite for the defense of your\\ncountry.\" Then there was an appeal for contribution of funds to\\nan airplane factory, development of new airplanes for military\\npurposes, of course, for which the popular name is, \"The Soviet\\nAnswer to ^Chamberlain.\" They capitalize Chamberlain at every\\npossible opportunity. I suppose every new religion has to have a\\ndevil as well as a god, and so beside Lenine for their god, they\\ntend to settle upon Chamberlain as the diabolical element in the\\ninternational situation.\\nThere was a very fine specimen of workman standing outside,\\na magnificent one, wielding a big sledge-hammer; and I took the\\nliberty of going up to him and taking hold of his arms, I said—\\nmy friend translating—\"You seem to have done your share\\npreparing for the defense of your country.\" And then he wanted to\\nknow who we were and where we were from and so on. He\\nwas told.\\n  \\n                            \\nThen he delivered a very eloquent oration, not an educational\\noration, one with real spirit, fire, standing by his anvil, with his\\nsledge-hammer still in his hand. And naturally, at least from their\\nstandpoint, naturally it was an appeal to us to go back and\\npromote the revolution to free the workers of our own country. The\\nRussian who was with me said that his language was really\\nremarkable, the range of vocabulary, the accuracy of his grammar\\nand so on. He was a young man of about twenty-three; and not\\nknowing any Russian, I could testify to his freedom and power\\nas an orator.\\nWell, that suggested to me to say it was rather hard to get\\nworkmen to start a revolution when they had their own motor\\ncars and radios and phonographs; and painted as idyllic a\\npicture as I could of the prosperity of the American laboring man.\\nWe did not refer to his wife with silk stockings, because that had\\nnot become part of our campaign literature at that time; but we\\ndid the best we could. (Laughter.)\\nWell, he had to change his attack a little. \"Well, that does\\nnot make any difference. You are educators; you are cultivated\\npeople, and as cultivated people you cannot be satisfied until all\\nof the people of your community have got the same cultural\\nadvantages that you have.\" He said: \"Now here, that is my motor\\nbicycle; that belongs to me. I haven\\'t got a motor car, but I have\\ngot that. But,\" he said, \"am I satisfied? No, I can\\'t be satisfied\"—\\nand then he pointed to all the other workmen—\"until he has got\\none, he has got one, he has got one. I can\\'t be a cultivated man if\\nI were satisfied before they all have one.\"\\nWell, that is a sample coming from a workman of the extent to\\nwhich this ideal of a cultural end or aim has permeated at least\\nthe section of the Bolshevist Republic that is sympathetic with\\nthe present regime.\\nNow this story is not anywhere near complete. I want to tell\\nyou what this colony was. It was a colony of juvenile criminals,\\nyoung men from eighteen to twenty-two or twenty-three who are\\nselected by a committee from the penitentiaries and prisons,\\ntaken out there, and various forms of shops and industrial work\\nhave been developed. They live there. Not only that, but there is\\nno wall.\\n^It is quite a colony now, five hundred people, and growing\\nevery year. It is also now a coeducational colony. (Laughter.)\\n  \\n                            \\nThey now have about forty or fifty women, and they expect to\\nincrease the number. They are building new buildings, raising\\nfunds. They take them—they are all in prison, you understand;\\nthey do not create them for the express purpose (laughter),—and\\nthey are enlarging, raising funds, and they expect to have a\\ncolony of some two thousand juvenile criminals.\\nAs there are no walls around there, there are no guards at the\\ngates. With a very few exceptions, there are no rules except the\\nlaws which this colony of criminals themselves pass. There are a\\nfew laws. They must not drink on the premises, but they do go to\\nMoscow, and there is no rule against their drinking, though their\\ngetting drunk is very much discouraged. But, as the man at the\\nhead of it, a doctor, said to us, \"It would be perfectly futile for us\\nto pass rules that they could not drink at all.\" He said, \"We can\\nbring pressure to bear to discourage drunkenness.\" They have\\nactually killed out, succeeded in eliminating, the use of drugs and\\ndope of all kinds, and you know what that means in a large\\ncolony, fairly large colony, of criminals.\\nThe other chief law is, for the first three months they are there,\\nthey are on probation, and they cannot leave the grounds\\nwithout getting permission. There is no guard at the gate. Someone\\nasked him if they did not run away, and the man shrugged his\\nshoulders and said: \"Well, when there are no means to use force\\nof any kind to keep them in, I do not know whether you could\\ncall it running away or not.\" Then he finally said that last year,\\nduring the whole year, there were three persons who left the\\ninstitution. He said, \"At first we were accused of being very anti-\\nsocial, because we did not restrain them. We were charged with\\nenabling prisoners to turn loose on the community.\" He was a\\nman of remarkable calmness and equanimity of spirit, a very\\nwonderful character. And again he shrugged his shoulders and\\nsaid: \"Oh, if they do not go back to a criminal life, it is all right.\\nAnd if they do go back to a criminal life, the police pick them up\\nand put them back in jail before very long. It does not do much\\nharm.\" (Laughter.) We asked him if there was any real regulation\\nabout the class of criminals they take in. He said, \"Well, there is\\none; we do not take murderers.\" And then again came the\\nhumorous look on his face. \"But,\" he said, \"at that, I would not\\nguarantee that we did not have some here.\" (Laughter.) Now this\\nyoung man who gave us a lecture on the importance of\\n  \\n                            \\ncultivation was one of these juvenile criminals who had been re-\\neducated under the system of extraordinary freedom.\\nIf anything were needed to add to the picture, it is the fact this\\nschool, or colony, rather, was ^founded by the head of the G.P.U:,\\nthe old Tcheka; that is the secret police espionage force which is\\nresponsible for the coercion of the element in the population that\\nis suspected not to be in sympathy with the present regime. One\\ncomes across many contradictions in Russia, but I do not know\\nof any that is more picturesque than the fact that the man who\\nis at the head of the most effective coercive organization had\\nfounded a colony for criminals that is based upon the idea of the\\nmost complete liberty of any educational reformatory colonies\\never found in the world. And the head of this school is absolutely\\nconvinced that every criminal is capable of being reformed and\\nrestored to a useful social life, unless he is absolutely\\npathological, and provided the proper social environment can be found\\nfor him. There is that union of oppression and coercion on the\\none hand, and an extraordinary amount of freedom and what we\\ncall democracy in certain other respects, running through as far\\nas I could observe a great many phases of Russian life.\\nThe main idea of the Russian school is to centre about the\\ncreation of this ideology of the laboring class, which means the\\nidea of labor as the central theme of the school. To develop that\\nidea, to see how they work it out, would take too much time, and\\ninvolve us in some technicalities. I may say this, however: it is a\\nunion of two things—they have taken the psychology and a good\\ndeal of the methods of the more advanced, so-called progressive\\nschools, experimental schools, from all the other countries about\\nwhich they knew anything or could glean anything from\\nliterature, the newer schools in Germany particularly, in the\\nScandinavian countries, and especially in the United States.\\nUp to 1923, their school system was not very much organized.\\nThe main idea was a school with a great deal of freedom for the\\nchildren, and as much activity as possible, as distinguished from\\nthe passive absorption, inculcation methods, pouring-in methods\\nof the old regime.\\nThen in 1923, they felt the lack of organization, and these were\\nmore or less borrowed ideas, also coming I should say from\\n^Tolstoy\\'s educational experiment, he indirectly getting it from\\nRousseau. The thing became more systematized, and was united\\n  \\n                            \\nrather consciously and deliberately with the general social and\\neconomic philosophy of Marx and Lenine, so that the activity\\nschool became what they called a labor school.\\nCuriously enough—no, not curiously, perhaps, if you take the\\nRussian background and all into account—the Russians do not\\nidealize work, labor, for its own sake. In fact, they come very\\nclose to saying that it is, if not a curse, it is a necessary evil;\\ntherefore we want to get it over as soon as we can, and distribute it as\\nequitably as possible, and surround it with as agreeable\\nconditions as possible; insurance against accident, good hygienic\\nconditions, frequent vacations and so on. So when they say labor\\nschool, they are very careful to say that the work is not to be an\\nend in itself. It is not the utilitarian product they are after, but\\nrather the training in some form of labor that will be useful to\\nsociety later, and the cultivation of a sense of the significance,\\nmeaning, and the history of labor in the school.\\nNow, with labor as the centre, they work out in two\\ndirections, but perhaps first I had better say how they organize their\\ncurriculum. They have attempted to abolish separate subjects\\nentirely. They have reacted very strongly against the curriculum or\\nprogram organization, geography, history, arithmetic and\\nreading and writing. They attempt to find one theme, one subject in\\nthe activity of the pupils, in relation to which they will need some\\narithmetic, some geography, some nature study. These things\\nwill come in gradually; and only as they get up to the high\\nschool, to the university, will these various phases of a common\\nsubject matter, which they call a complex or a synthesis, be\\ndifferentiated into school studies.\\nWell, their centre, this synthetic centre, is some form of human\\nactivity in the form of labor. That forms as it were the centre.\\nThen to one side that moves out into the study of nature and\\nnatural forces, the beginnings of physical and natural science. On\\nthe other side, this study of activities of labor moves out into the\\nstudy of social life, social organization and institutions, and of\\nhistory; and of course all interpreted from the labor point of view,\\nas that is understood in the communistic theory of economics.\\nI just give one instance taken from the fifth year of the school.\\nThe central theme of the whole year is the agricultural labor of\\nRussia as a whole. The whole thing works in cycles. In the\\ncountry, they study the agriculture of their own village in the second\\n  \\n                            \\nyear. When they get to the fifth year, they take the agricultural\\nactivities of Russia, that is to say, the life of the farmers brought\\nto them by pictures or experience and so on, all through the\\ndifferent districts of that very large country, with its great diversity\\nof climates and soils. They study that, and the activities of cattle\\nraising, of poultry, and some accounts of the methods that are\\nbeing introduced to reform and improve agriculture, and to\\nintroduce large scale farming, instead of small scale farming, and\\nthe other projects of the Bolshevist regime in relation to the\\npeasant.\\nNow, on the natural side they study soils, for instance, a more\\ntechnical study, with some chemistry of the soils of their own\\nlocality; some study of the geography and geology of soils all\\nthrough the different parts of Russia; study of the climate of their\\nown region in greater detail, with more accurate observations,\\nand records of climates of different parts of Russia. They\\ncombine geography, nature study and such experimental science as\\ncan be worked in or as their own facilities in the particular\\nschool permit them.\\nNow on the social side they make a more detailed study of the\\nlife of the farmers, if it is a country district in their own\\nneighborhood; but more especially they study the history of the farming\\nclass, the peasant class in Russia. They go back to the early days\\nof serfdom, the creation of serfdom, the feudalism of Russia; the\\ndifferent efforts to get rid of serfdom; the abolition under the\\nCzar of serfdom; the condition of the peasant after that time;\\nand the land problem leading up, of course, to the revolutions of\\n1917 and 1918, and the taking over of the land by the peasants;\\nand ending up again with the study of the land policies of the\\nSoviet regime.\\nI take that just as one picture of how making labor the theme,\\nstarting with that as the centre, they work out on one side into\\nthe study of nature, and on the other side to social institutions\\nand history. And in principle, this is the official program for\\ngreater Russia; officially the program goes through on these\\nlines, the whole scheme.\\nNow in the centre, labor, there are two controlling ideas; first,\\nthat it shall not be a matter of books, of being told by teachers. In\\ntheory, though still very far from practice, every school in the\\ncountry—this is pretty well carried out—has to have a school\\n  \\n                            \\nfield, a school garden, if possible, with animals, bees or\\nsomething, and a flower garden as well as a vegetable one, possibly a\\nsmall orchard; and the students actually take part, not to become\\nfarmers, but to get a background for their more detailed\\nspecialized scientific study, and to get the general contact, sympathy,\\nwith the farmer\\'s point of view. Then they are supposed to have\\nkitchens, dining rooms, and have some practical experience there\\nas a basis for chemical problems, a study of animal and vegetable\\nfoods, their origin, growth and so on. And then shops, which are\\nnot however formal manual training courses, which they say is\\ntoo much like factory work, but self-service, making the\\nnecessary repairs of the school; taking care of repairing the furniture;\\nin some cases learning how to take care of their own clothes,\\ncobble their own shoes, make simple apparatus used in the other\\nclasses of the schools, material for demonstration purposes and\\nso on. So that they get a certain amount of actual activity in\\nconnection with the so-called labor activity side.\\nThen the other great principle is that what they get that they\\ndo not get from their own direct activity they must get by\\nobservation, before they go to books; not that they rule out books, but\\nthe introduction to every subject must come from their own\\nobservation.\\nThere is a very important conclusion that at once follows from\\nthat, namely, that no two districts or regions can have exactly the\\nsame educational system. It is a decentralized central system. The\\ncentral system lays down the general principles, but to get\\nobservation, contact with local activities and labor, they obviously\\nhave to adapt the details of their curriculum to their own local\\nsystem. The regions have taken over in a very general, wholesale\\nway what they call the project system. Their main criticism is that\\nevery problem must take the form of some social, useful work,\\nand useful outside the school; not that it must all be there, but it\\nmust head up to some kind of activity that takes them out of the\\nschool into their own community, in a way that makes them\\nhelpful to the community.\\nHow far they have succeeded in carrying this out, how far they\\ncan do it in the future, I do not know; but I think no one can\\ndeny that if it is practicable, if it is feasible, it is a very great\\neducational idea; that the school, and the children in the school,\\nshall become socialized, become cooperative by actual\\nparticipation in useful ways in the actual life of their own community.\\n  \\n                            \\nI am going to take time to read the classified heads, just the\\nmain headings under which this work may go on: first, economic\\nactivity, and in detail the sorting of grain. Of course Russian\\nfarming is very backward. The mere idea of improving the strains\\nof grain, of picking out good seed and not planting seed that will\\nnot germinate, and so on, the destruction of weeds, the\\ndisinfecting of grain with formalin, the introduction of new varieties, the\\nrenting out of agricultural machinery, which may be found at the\\nschool, importing newer and better grades of grain, the planting\\nof trees in deforested regions and so on, all this is an\\nadvancement in Russian agriculture. Then there is the going out and\\ntalking to peasants about better methods of rotating crops, and\\nall of those things.\\nTo us, it is rather humorous, perhaps, for children from twelve\\nto fifteen or sixteen years of age to go out and instruct their\\nelders in improved agricultural methods, as well as actually\\nengaging in certain jobs that might help things on. But the Russian\\nyouth are a very fascinating spectacle to my eye; they are very\\nsimple, direct, naive, although with a great deal of confidence,\\nbut without any element of freshness, which we would associate\\nwith a similar degree of confidence on the part of our own youth.\\nCertainly the more intelligent part of the school population, as I\\ncame in contact with them, have been imbued with the idea that\\nthey really are capable of engaging in a work of social creation,\\nand they have a certain kind of enthusiasm and directness,\\nconfidence in life rather than simply self-confidence, that is very\\nattractive.\\nIn the one country village that I went to, they had ^an\\nexperimental station, not just an experimental school but a station\\nwith fifteen different experimental schools in it, under a single\\nhead, to work out methods and materials for the rural districts.\\nThere were certain boys there very much interested in foreigners,\\nand they followed us around, came and visited us at the place we\\nwere staying, and talked to us. Unfortunately, as I said, only two\\nmembers of our party could talk Russian.\\nOne of these boys had been one of the so-called ^wild boys, one\\nof the products of the war and the famine, separated from his\\nparents, perhaps the parents dead, perhaps simply separated\\nfrom them in one of those migrations across the country during\\nthe time of famine. He was telling various stories about his\\nexperiences, and a Russian friend remarked to him: \"Well, you ought\\n  \\n                            \\nto write that up.\" Thereupon the boy replied, a boy about fifteen,\\nin a very natural, direct way: \"Oh, I am writing my\\nautobiography. I have got two chapters done already.\" (Laughter.) I will say\\nthe boy was very attractive; there was nothing conceited or\\noffensive in his reply.\\n^Another boy talking to this same friend said: \"I wish you\\nwould put down my name in your notebook; and then some time\\nin the future when you go back to America, and you see my\\nname, either because of a book I have written or a picture I have\\npainted, or something I have done, you will remember it was the\\nboy you saw over here.\" That perhaps was a little more\\nconceited, but it was not offensively so in its manner.\\nI do not know that I should take any more time to talk about\\ntheir social-political work, that is the direct political work,\\nengaging in campaigning, not generally political but local soviet\\nelections, getting the peasants out to vote, and talking over the\\ncandidates. One of these boys showed me a lot of slogans that he\\nhad made for one of these campaigns, banners, mottoes and so\\nforth: public enlightenment; dissemination of information\\nregarding works of art; anti-religious propaganda; fight against\\nsuperstition and prejudice; agitation and propaganda among\\nhomeless children; health and sanitation; popular hygiene work,\\nof which as you know there is very great need in the villages,\\nto say nothing of the towns; propaganda against smoking and\\ndrinking; fight against home brew alcohol. (Laughter.)\\nThis liquor question is a very serious question. Before I went\\naway, some of the friends I had met over there said: \"I wish you\\nwould tell us what your most severe criticism is.\" Well, you\\ncannot be too harsh with people who have been awfully nice to you,\\nand very friendly, who have made you feel they are really old-\\ntime personal friends; but I said, \"well, I think liquor is the worst\\nthing I have seen, and your greatest problem over here.\" And it is\\na very serious question, both the drunkenness and the whole\\nbootlegging question, not because they have prohibition, but\\nbecause the manufacture of alcohol is a government monopoly and\\nthe prices are very high; and they do what some other people do.\\n(Laughter.)\\nThen there is regional work, work for regional resources,\\nindividual information, wrong paths, aid to needy widows, to\\nwidows of the red army, aid to victims of fire, aid to needy pupils and\\nso on, introducing flowers. They are not talking of the flowers\\n  \\n                            \\nwhich they raise in their school gardens, but for the sick and the\\nharder up portion of the population and so on.\\nWell, I could go on for a very long time. Just in concluding, I\\nwant to say one thing; to refer to these experimental stations,\\nincluding fourteen different schools, with a selected staff, all\\nengaged in working out materials and methods, which after they\\nare tried out, are submitted to the state council, and then\\ntransmitted to other rural schools. There is a similar experimental\\nschool for urban districts, connected with factories, in the same\\nway that this is connected with the farmers and peasants, in\\nMoscow, which does the same work for the urban schools. This\\nis for greater Russia. Every province, not merely the greater\\ndivision, but the smaller division, has its own regional experimental\\nschool, to make the local regional adaptations.\\nAside from this there are four state supported educational\\nresearch lines of work. One of these corresponds to what we have\\nin many places, departments of research in connection with the\\nteacher training school. Beside that, there is one engaged in\\nresearch on the curriculum; another one engaged exclusively with\\nanimals; branches in different cities in child, infant, pre-school\\npsychology, or as they call it, \"Pedology,\" because they include\\nthe study of physiology and child study. I think they got the word\\n^pedology from America, if I remember rightly, from Stanley\\nHall. And one Russian who came over here evidently came\\nexpecting to hear the word pedology on every hand, and he was\\nquite surprised in not hearing it. Also as he came out of the\\nAmerican Consul at Riga, getting his visa (he had his initiation\\nthere), a man asked him his profession, and he said he was a\\npedologist, and the clerk said: \"Oh, I know what that is; you are a\\ncorn doctor.\" (Laughter.)\\nThere are two hundred and fifty different workers in this\\npsychological child study department of government supported\\nresearch alone. And they have published literally hundreds of\\nbooks for teachers and for parents, relating to various phases of\\nchild development, besides thousands of pedagogical articles for\\nperiodicals. They held a convention in 1927. There were a\\nthousand delegates from all over Russia; seven different sections, two\\nhundred teachers, two thousand guests besides the thousand\\nregular delegates. That in just this one line.\\nThe other branch, which has four or five lines within itself, is\\nthe study of out of school education, in which a ^Russian who has\\n  \\n                            \\nbeen in this country, a trained engineer, took back many\\neducational ideas from here, social education, that he obtained from\\nliving in the university social settlement of New York City; he is\\na very active spirit. If I had been able to stay there, I could easily\\nhave spent my hour just telling you about that one school. One\\ndivision is children\\'s inventions. They make a collection of the\\nmodels of all the inventions the children make, if they work, and\\nsystematically encourage them. This is for out of school activity,\\nthe encouragement of inventive activities, largely of a mechanical\\ntype, among children. They are studying out of school reading;\\nhave probably made the most extensive collection of children\\'s\\nliterature, and attempted analysis of what makes reading\\ninteresting to children, that has been made anywhere in the world.\\nOf course I have touched on the high spots only, the good\\nspots; many of them more theoretical, or at least qualitative,\\nthan carried out as yet to any quantitative extent. But it is not\\njust on paper, though I should give you a very distorted idea if I\\nhad conveyed the impression that all of these things are working\\non any very large scale. But these things are actually there, not\\nsimply on paper; and they are to my mind genuinely\\ncharacteristic of the spirit and the vitality of this new educational\\nmovement, which made me say at the outset that if they can get peace,\\nquiet, order, continuous development for a generation, I think\\nthat they will have valuable contributions. They have already\\nsome valuable contributions, but they will have great\\ncontributions to make to the educational systems of the rest of the world,\\nquite independent of any injection of the element of communistic\\npropaganda, for many of these principles, and many of these\\nactivities, are capable of being very easily taken out of that\\nparticular sentiment.\\nNow I have been asked whether I was hopeful or depressed or\\noptimistic or pessimistic about the situation and its future. If I\\nmay say a word or two in conclusion about the latter part of the\\nproblem: About the immediate situation, I am neither hopeful\\nnor depressed, optimistic or pessimistic, simply because I do not\\nknow enough about it, and it would take a long residence and a\\ngood deal of detail study, to my mind, to form any estimate that\\nis worth the paper it is written on, or the ear strain it takes to\\nlisten to anybody\\'s view on the subject, who does not know a\\ngreat deal more about it than I do. But if one means by that the\\n  \\n                            \\nlong run outcome, the outcome for the Russian people, and not\\nsimply for a particular faction of the Russian regime, I can only\\nsay that I am intensely hopeful, and the reason of course is the\\nRussian people.\\nIt sounds quite trite, but I hope not patronizing, in saying the\\nRussians are a very great people; and it is impossible, to my\\nmind, that a people with the gifts that that people has should not\\nhave a very great future, and that they should not succeed in\\nfinding their way out of their present difficulties and obstacles; and in\\nthe end do something which is not merely significant, but which\\nis something new. That it will be exactly in the line of the\\nexpectations of the present leaders, I personally am very doubtful. But\\nI do think that it will be something different socially and\\neconomically and politically from what has been worked out in the\\nrest of the world, in the end.\\nThe Russians are a great people. Everybody knows that they\\nare greatly gifted in artistic directions. They are great in music.\\nThey are great in ^dramatic expression, not merely in drama but\\nin acting, and in the whole management of the theatre. I suppose\\nthere is no doubt that to-day the Russian theatre leads the world;\\nand not merely their old theatre, which existed of course before\\nthe revolution, but that their new dramatic developments,\\ntheatrical developments along scenic construction and all that, are\\nsome of the most interesting experiments going on in the world.\\nAnd we all know they are great in fiction, and this artistic\\ntemperament is in the people. They do not suffer from the emotional\\ninhibition which the average Anglo-Saxon has, which gives them\\na certain advantage when it comes to artistic creation.\\nNot merely that, but they are an unexhausted people; they\\nare a fresh, vigorous, pioneer people. One is more reminded of\\nAmerica, at least the older America, the pioneer America, in\\nRussia than in any other part of the world. Now that was my feeling.\\nI could not trust it exactly, but I happened to meet ^Mr.\\nBakmetiev, after I got back. He is the ex-Kerensky ambassador to\\nthis country, and of course naturally of no great sympathy with\\nthe present regime, and I mentioned that I had that impression of\\nthe Russian people. He said it was true, and that history bore it\\nout; that they had that same movement on towards the frontier\\nand conquest of their immediate natural environment that we\\nhave had.\\n  \\n                            \\nThe rest of Europe, especially after the war, of course is tired;\\nthey are fatigued. They talk about the future of civilization and\\nthe downfall of civilization. Now, that is not the spirit in Russia,\\neven of those who are completely opposed to the present regime.\\nIt is a spirit of vigor, of freshness, of unexpended natural\\nresources, and of unexpended human resources.\\nFor that reason I for one came away from Russia feeling that\\ntheir future was a very, very great one, and that they deserved the\\nsympathy, the Russian people deserved the sympathy and the\\nhelp, whatever can be given them, moral support and so on,\\nintellectual and educational, of the American people. For I really\\nbelieve that in many respects the type and temper of the two\\npeoples is more similar, at least the old-fashioned American, the\\npioneer American, than any other two countries in the world at\\npresent.

Stenographic report\\nin the Anita McCormick Blaine Papers, Box 168, State Historical Society ofWis-consin,\\nWisconsin, Madison. For Children\\'s Charter to which Dewey refers, see \"The \\nChildren\\'s Charter,\" in White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, \\n1930 (New York: Century Co., 1931), pp. 46-48 (print edition, Appendix 6).]\\n»»\\nI\\n^Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Chairman; Friends, Delegates,\\nMembers of this Regional Conference: The discussions of the\\n^White House Conference were limited, very wisely so, in one\\nway, in spite of the very wide ground, comprehensive ground\\ncovered. They dealt with the school child, but not exactly with\\nthe child in school. That is they did not consider distinctively\\neducational or scholastic problems. They left that aspect of the\\nmatter, I take it, to the educators themselves.\\nThe men and women who met almost a year ago to carry on\\nthe work of the Conference dealt with school conditions as they\\naffected the general health of the pupils. They called for a health\\nprogram. They demanded adequate recreational facilities, for\\nschool and other children. They pointed out the need of special\\nclasses and treatment for defectives, delinquents and sub-normal\\nchildren; demanded sympathetic and curative treatment; for the\\nboys and girls, the unfortunate ones who had already come\\nunder the arm of the law, they emphasized the need of vocational\\ntraining.\\nThey did not raise—this was left I take it to the educators—\\nthe question of the regulation of the regular school program, the\\ndaily more or less routine administrative work of the school to\\nthe great ends which are laid down in the ^Children\\'s Charter.\\nThis is a task which the educators must take up; and so it is from\\nthe standpoint of an educator, speaking to the teachers,\\n  \\n                            \\neducators, administrators in the audience, rather than to those who\\nare social welfare workers in a more technical sense, that I am to\\nspeak. The findings of the Conference, the Children\\'s Charter,\\nare to my mind a challenge to the teacher, a challenge which will\\nnot be met fully, even if all the specific recommendations of the\\nConference are carried out by the other welfare bodies. There\\nstill is left the question of the contribution of the general work of\\nthe school in its studies hour by hour, methods of teaching hour\\nby hour and day by day; methods of discipline for the\\nwholesome development of child life that represents the unifying\\npurpose of the Conference.\\nNow this is far from the first time that those directly in charge\\nof the schools have had a challenge put up to them from the\\noutside that those on the inside improve the technique of their work\\nand perfect its detail. The larger educational changes usually go\\nback to those outside the school rooms, to those who make the\\nsocial demands, teachers already being absorbed in their daily\\ntask. Now it seems to me that the Charter gives educators a\\nchance for once, perhaps, to reverse this process, and instead of\\nwaiting until social forces have spoken imperatively, take the\\nlead in a unifying organizing work. For the aims set forth in the\\nChildren\\'s Charter cannot be recognized by special institutions\\nand agencies if these latter are independent and isolated from the\\ngeneral daily work of the school.\\nThe great need is that the entire school, in all its methods,\\nperformance and operations day by day be so organized as to\\npromote child welfare in the largest sense of the word.\\nTake for example the matter of vocational guidance; how can\\nthe ideals of proper vocational guidance for all, that are set forth\\nin the charter, be realized without a very considerable change in\\nthe traditional subject matter, a greater change than has yet\\ntaken place, not in all schools, but in many schools? A\\ncurriculum based on traditional subjects cannot wholly cover the\\nvocational tastes of all pupils. It is also absurd, though not so\\nobviously so, to suppose that the lack of the ordinary curriculum to\\ndisclose vocational aptitude, tastes and disabilities can be fully\\nmade good by adding on a special device, no matter how expert,\\nor merely by tacking on special courses labeled \"vocational.\"\\nThe pupils must be brought in their regular work in contact with\\na sufficient variety of materials to disclose their aptitudes. The\\n  \\n                            \\nmaterial, regular materials must be taught day by day, hour by\\nhour, by methods which will bring to light the pupil\\'s own\\ncapacities, weaknesses, tastes, etc. Now, as long as our methods in\\nthe school are largely devoted to absorbing information and then\\nfinding out in the recitation periods simply how much\\ninformation pupils have stowed away, what real opportunity is there for\\nanything that goes very deep in the way of vocational guidance,\\nthe discovery of aptitude and the direction of it into its proper\\nchannel?\\nArticle ten of the Charter reads: \"For every child an education\\nwhich through the discovery and development of his individual\\nabilities prepares him for life, and through training and\\nvocational guidance prepares him for a living which shall give him the\\nmaximum of satisfaction.\" Fine, I say, and fine, you all say. But\\nthis ideal, I repeat, cannot be realized simply by instituting a few\\nspecial devices. The whole work of the school must be brought\\nto bear upon the solution of this great problem.\\nThe same is true of what is set forth in the next article of the\\nCharter: That every child shall have \"such teaching and training\\nas will prepare him or her for successful parenthood and the\\nmaking use of the right of citizenship.\" This is fundamental, but\\nso fundamental, I think you will all agree with me, that the need\\ncannot be met excepting by an organization of the whole work of\\nthe school. And this organization means in many, perhaps the\\nmajority of American schools, the reorganization of their\\ntraditional studies and methods.\\nConsider again these health aims, which seem to be very\\nspecialized, and more likely to be met by particular means. What\\n^Dr. Judd has already told us shows us how such a matter as\\nhandwriting has a bearing upon the proper nervous and\\nmuscular development of the child. Health is not a special end to be\\nbrought about simply by special means. Certain things can be\\nspecified on the negative side. We must get rid of bad air, foul air,\\nand the kind of seating that almost forces bad postures of the\\nchildren. And so we can specify positively ample playgrounds\\nand so on. But health is a certain kind of wholeness of body, and\\nit cannot be made secure excepting by conditions that regularly\\naffect the whole attitude, being of the pupil.\\nA physician concerned in the mental hygiene movement once\\ntold me that he is persuaded that there is the most intimate\\n  \\n                            \\nconnection between the general health, in all students he had come\\nin contact with who were colored pupils, well matured, more\\nhardened to resistance, and their emotional attitudes of\\nattraction and repulsion toward their school studies. There is much in\\nour traditional curriculum, and in the method of teaching it,\\nwhich perhaps not only dulls the mind but depresses bodily\\nvigor, even though there is nothing resulting in the way of illness\\nthat would require the attention of physicians. Body as well as\\nmind is often cramped, made more inflexible by the ordinary\\nroutine of school work.\\nAnd this health, of course, includes mental well being as well\\nas physical. Is there not a great challenge to educators in the fact\\nwhich has been impressed upon us in recent years that in our\\nhospitals, asylums, public institutions, as many beds are\\noccupied by persons suffering from some degree of mental disorder\\nas from all other forms of disorder put together? If mental\\ndisorder, small as well as great, mal-adjustment, goes on growing,\\nand we measure abnormality by statistics about the average\\nperson, it looks as if the abnormal people would be the normal ones\\nin another generation. (Laughter.)\\nI do not wish, of course, to suggest the schools are primarily\\nresponsible for the extent of mental disorders among us. They\\ngrow much more out of mal-adjustments in family and home\\nrelations. But certainly it should be—it might be part of the\\nprovince of the schools to develop more immunity, more prophylaxis\\nagainst the development of these mental and moral disorders.\\nAnd here again special methods, special classes and courses can\\nhardly meet the need. It requires again here a good deal of\\nreorganization if we are to bring about the contribution which the\\nschool can make to the wholesome development of child life.\\nThe great need is the change in the attitude of the educators\\ntowards their regular work.\\nDr. Judd referred to one point I want to repeat, the importance\\nof the emotions in the development of normal, mental and\\nphysical well being. If the schools are to protect from future\\ninstability, it must be very largely by greater attention to the role of\\nthe emotional factors in the human development. Our schools\\nhave been intellectualizing and, in the narrow sense of the word,\\nover-practical in training for special forms of skill at the expense\\n  \\n                            \\nof the development of the healthy animal, development of\\naffections, relations of the children to each other and to parents.\\nI have one more instance of what seems to me the impossibility\\nof meeting the recommendations of the White House Conference\\nexcepting through an organization of the whole school work.\\nThe Conference emphasized the significance of life outside the\\nhome and the school, the life of children outside home and school;\\nthe relation of children, pupils, to the church, to those different\\nagencies which deal with the spare time of boys and girls—\\nrecreation facilities, moving pictures, theatre and radio,\\ncommercialized amusements, libraries, the use of libraries, camps and so\\non. The report on this phase of child life terminates with saying\\nthat 40 per cent of the lives of most children and youth is really\\nspent in spare time activities outside home and school; and that\\nthe spare time, leisure time activities, have the most important\\ninfluence on character formation, so that the community should\\nfocus attention upon this phase of child welfare.\\nThere again is a proposition to which we may all give a hearty\\namen. But can even this proper care of leisure time of children\\noutside the school be secured without the cooperation of the\\nschools themselves? For children, youth, will take to their clubs\\nor recreation fields, movies, camps and so on, the attitudes, the\\nmental and moral attitudes, which are formed in the school. So it\\nmakes a very great difference whether we look upon these\\nagencies simply as supplemental work of the school, particularly as\\nsupplementing, in making good the defects of the school work,\\ncorrecting their deficiencies and faults, or whether the ideals of\\nthe spare time interests and activities outside the school\\nharmonize and work together with those of the school all the way\\nthrough.\\nNow this is not a purely academic issue, I think. There is one\\nsentence in the report of the particular committee, ^Committee G,\\nwhich dealt with this matter, I would like to quote. The passage\\nreads: \"Our system of education in general does not stimulate\\ninventiveness, imagination or initiative. Comparatively little has\\nbeen done by the school to train esthetic tastes, which could be a\\nguide to selection of activities in leisure time.\"\\nI am not going to ask just how far that statement is justified,\\nhow far it is not. There is enough truth in it to indicate that\\n  \\n                            \\nunless the schools themselves do more to develop inventiveness,\\nimagination, initiative and aesthetic taste, any work of the\\nagencies that deal with the child outside of school will be, to say the\\nleast, very greatly hampered.\\nSo from these various instances, which of course might be\\nmultiplied by going through the whole of the recommendations\\nfound in the Children\\'s Charter, I conclude that the fine, noble\\npurposes set forth in that charter cannot be realized if we break\\nup the incidents which shape the life and character of the pupil\\ninto separate, isolated and independent fractions. It is one of our\\nAmerican weaknesses to operate by taking on new things more\\nthan by reconstructing from the centre outward. So it seems to\\nme the great lesson which we educators have to learn from the\\nproceedings of that Conference is that if its inspiring aims are to\\nbe realized, the regular work of the school in its courses of study,\\nits methods of teaching and discipline, must keep these ends\\nconstantly in view. Every boy and girl is an individual, that is an\\nundivided unity, and the unity of personality cannot be reached by\\ntreating the boys and girls as if they were simply a bundle of\\ndisconnected, unrelated elements, with a particular class of\\ninstitution separately to take care of each one.\\nSo as the various reports of the Conference close with\\ncertain recommendations, advice, I would like to close with a note\\ndirected particularly to the teachers among us. First, that we\\nshould all study very carefully the report, the recommendations\\nof the various committees of the Child Welfare Conference.\\nSecondly, what is obviously more important than merely getting an\\nintellectual acquaintance with them is that we educators should\\nconsider how far the schools themselves might become the\\ncentral and the unifying agency for realizing the aims which are\\ntherein set forth; the integrating element that will keep the\\npurposes from being so split up with a variety of different agencies\\nthat in the end we shall not succeed as we might.\\nThe task is a difficult one, but after all it is in line with what\\nthe best schools at the present time are all doing. And it seems to\\nme unless the educators take these reports as a challenge, and\\nconsider the challenge seriously, there is danger that leadership\\nwill pass from the schools and educators into a variety of outside\\nspecial organizations. While on the other hand, only through the\\nintegration of child welfare, social welfare agencies bringing it\\n  \\n                            \\ninto the regular work of the school, can the schools do what they\\nreally have it in their power to accomplish. (Applause.)\\nII\\nMr. Chairman, Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen: I was at\\na meeting last winter where my friend and former colleague,\\n^James Harvey Robinson, was speaking, and the audience rose as\\nyou have kindly risen to greet him. Sitting near him, I heard him\\nmutter to himself, \"I am not the national anthem.\" (Laughter.)\\nWhat he said under his breath, I take the liberty of saying out\\nloud, though I appreciate your kind appreciation.\\nYou will excuse one of my age, a former resident of Chicago, if\\non an occasion like this, the mind goes back to ten happy and for\\nhim very instructive years spent in this city, and the associations\\nformed at that time, many of which on the personal side have\\nbeen renewed to-day. They are forced on my memory very\\npleasantly through the friends that I have associated with at this table\\nthis evening. For those memories and associations, I think are\\nquite pertinent to this Regional Conference held here in Chicago\\nat this time.\\nThere are, as everyone who has lived in Chicago and learned\\nto love it knows, there are two sides to Chicago, and the real\\nChicago is that which is represented in this Conference, represented\\nin this gathering here to-night, rather than in what perhaps\\nattracts most attention in the headlines of the papers through the\\ncountry. I was thinking as I sat here that in everything but the\\nwords \"White House,\" not merely the Regional Conference but\\nthe National Conference might well have centered in the City of\\nChicago. If I mistake not, the ^first university chair that dealt with\\nsocial welfare, human welfare and social work as a regular part\\nof the university curriculum was here in the University of\\nChicago. I do not need to remind this audience of what the Social\\nSettlement in this city has stood for; what ^Jane Addams and\\nMary McDowell have stood for; what Miss Lathrop, Miss Grace\\nAbbott have stood for. I think one could say with a great deal of\\ntruth that the ^Children\\'s Bureau, which represents the organized\\nfederal work in behalf of the causes in which this Conference is\\ninterested, is a spiritual child of the work that originated in the\\n  \\n                            \\nCity of Chicago, and that there is not merely the spiritual descent\\nbut even a more literal direct and personal movement from the\\nCity of Chicago to this great branch of federal government. So\\nother memories have come into my mind which reinforce me on\\nthe appropriateness of the meeting and the significance of this\\nmeeting in Chicago to-day.\\nThere is one other thought which has come to my mind, which\\nI am going to venture to present, though it is of that kind of a\\nserious note which is closely connected with depression and\\nsuffering, and yet which I know is close to the surface of the\\nconsciousness, the feeling hearts of those here, as well as elsewhere\\nin our country to-day. So I may venture to speak of it.\\nThe section of the Children\\'s Charter which ^Dr. Fishbein read\\nspeaks of the right of every child to a home, and to the security\\nwhich the home, the home alone one may add, can give. And yet\\nto-day we know that from no fault of parents, and from causes\\nbeyond the control of physicians, child welfare with regard to\\nhomes all about us is crumbling, and the children as well as the\\nparents are losing the security which we have declared in words\\nto be the birthright of the children. We know that hundreds of\\nthousands of children—we do not know the number of hundreds\\nof thousands, and we merely estimate—are suffering physically\\nto-day from defective nutrition caused by the economic\\ncondition of the country to-day. The lowest estimate for the number of\\nquarts of milk that are distributed daily in Greater New York to-\\nday, as compared with a few years ago, is one million quarts.\\nThink of what that may mean. It is a real tragedy for the future of\\nthese children that are growing up.\\nWe have all of us, all the citizens, and not merely the experts, a\\ndouble responsibility, a responsibility indeed in all these specific\\ndirections that have been mentioned, but also a responsibility\\nthat society itself provide for the future of the children who are\\ngrowing up a more secure opportunity for a safe and useful life\\nthan we are demonstrating to-day will be possessed unless\\nsomething is done about it. We learned from Dr. Fishbein that it is\\nonly the last thirty years that we have calculated what the value\\nof a child is to society. Let us hope that, say thirty years from\\nnow, when a Conference is held in 1960, that those who are there\\nwill be able to say that we have also calculated what the value of\\na just and humane social order is to the child. (Applause.)\\n  \\n                            \\nIII\\nMr. Chairman, Friends: The Chairman, Mr. Bogan,\\nmight have at least called on two or three other people, and they\\nmight have said something that would arouse an idea in my\\nmind. I haven\\'t even any statistics to give you. (Laughter and\\nApplause.) I am not a specialist or an expert. I ought to be, and have\\nbeen, listening in a humble way to the instructions that have come\\nto us from the experts. I see there is a screen over here. I wish I\\nhad some pictures to show you, but I haven\\'t even got them.\\nI can tell you, however, of the pleasure it gives me to return\\nfrom time to time to this great city of Chicago, and not merely\\nsee my old friends, but have my enthusiasm, my convictions, and\\nmy faith for better development of civic and community life in\\nthis country renewed. I think there is no place in the country\\nwhere there is as much devotion, and as much community and\\ncivic interest and action as can be found in this region about the\\nCity of Chicago. When I ^read in the morning paper the number\\nof hold-ups there had been yesterday in four hours, I thought\\nthere was need for a good deal of civic energy and enthusiasm,\\nbut, as I said last evening in effect, I realize that an organization\\nlike this means immensely more for the future than these passing\\nepisodes which awake the sensational interest which the steady\\nand cumulative work of people who are represented here in the\\norganizations do not attract, the things of a constructive sort.\\nI wish above all to congratulate the Committee who organized\\nthis Conference. I want particularly to congratulate your\\nChairman, Mr. Bogan, for the great success of these meetings. I am\\nsure you will all go away with the same feeling which possesses\\nme, that a permanent impress upon the future, a better chance\\nfor the children, the neighborhood, the state, ultimately the\\nnation, will develop because of what has been said, heard, thought,\\nthe new energy that has been aroused in this series of meetings.\\n^Dr. Barnard has told me that some ten or a dozen of these\\nregional meetings had been held and other state meetings planned\\nfor, but I am quite sure none has been and none will be more\\npermanently successful, more useful than this meeting which has\\nbeen held here yesterday and to-day. I thank you all. (Applause.)\\n  \\n                            \\nAmerican Federation of Teachers Statement [Typescript, not typed by Dewey, in the John L. Childs Papers, SpecialCollec-tions,\\nCollections, Morris Library, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, ca. 1941;type-script\\ntypescript signed by Dewey.]\\n»»\\nWe desire to record publicly our sense of the important\\ncontribution to democracy and education which the Executive\\nCouncil of the American Federation of Teachers has made by its\\ndecision to revoke the charters of the two New York locals. Public\\neducation in our country now confronts a difficult situation. On\\nthe one hand, it is hard pressed to get the funds required to\\nprovide essential educational services for all the children of the\\nnation. On the other hand, it is attacked by powerful groups, which\\nfor one reason or another, seek to restrict freedom of teaching\\nin this period of social conflict and transition. We believe that\\nthe right kind of teachers\\' union could do much to strengthen\\nAmerican public education in this twofold struggle for freedom\\nand for adequate financial support.\\nUnfortunately, the two New York locals, although including in\\ntheir membership many honest supporters of democracy and\\neducation, have been brought under the domination of\\ncommunist forces which have worked under cover to fashion these\\norganizations into tools for their party purposes. As a result of this\\ncommunist manipulation and control these locals have lost not\\nonly the confidence of organized labor and of large numbers of\\nteachers in the schools and colleges of New York City, but also of\\nthe public without whose support the union cannot accomplish\\nanything substantial. Hence, although these locals have done\\ncertain desirable specific things, the net effect of their work in\\nthe last few years has been to injure, not to strengthen, public\\neducation.\\nBy its resolute action in revoking these charters the American\\n  \\n                            \\nFederation of Teachers has opened the way for bona fide\\nteachers\\' unions in New York City.

Randall\\'s Our Changing Civilization [Typescript in the John H. Randall, Jr., Papers, Rare Book and ManuscriptLi-brary,\\nLibrary, Butler Library, Columbia University, New York, N.Y., 1929.]\\n»»\\nI do not know when I have been so mentally excited as\\nin reading Dr. Randall\\'s Our Changing Civilization. It is the\\nmost penetrating exposition of the present situation of the\\nWestern World that I know of; it sets forth the existing conditions\\nin their causes and sweep of movement. One does not know\\nwhether to admire most the extraordinary scholarship which\\nmarks the book, the ease with which it is handled, or the power\\nof centering to a unified picture the variety of diverse streams\\nthat have entered into making our existing civilization. While\\nDr. Randall escapes the error of \"rationalizing\" existing\\nconditions, while indeed he indicates pointedly many of the forms this\\nidealization has taken, his historical grasp leaves us with a solidly\\nconstructed picture. The debunking which the book contains is a\\ndefinite contribution to a positive result and not an end in itself.\\nAny one who wants an understanding of how and why our\\npresent civilization is as it is should read this book.\\n  \\n                            \\nRemarks on Richard Welling\\'s As the Twig Is Bent [Typescript in the Richard G. Welling Papers, Rare Books and ManuscriptsDivi-sion,\\nDivision, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, New York Public Library, New\\nYork, N.Y., 1942.]\\n»»\\nEducators have always heard a great deal about our\\nschools as the bulwark of democracy. Here in As the Twig Is\\nBent is the story of a man who for sixty long years has been an\\nactive fighter for reform in our civic and political life. Richard\\nWelling, young at the age of eighty-four, has been a leader in\\nevery movement of this kind since he left college. This book is an\\naccount of his own life as blended with the history of his country.\\nIt gives a dramatic account of the practical experiences that led\\nhim to find the schools of the country to be the sole sure source\\nand guarantee of the clean, humane, efficient government for\\nwhich he had struggled in the many reform movements in which\\nhe took part. He also tells, alas, how the failure of the schools to\\nget down to basic democratic practices in their own organization\\nand conduct has retarded creation of that alert intelligent\\ncitizenship that understands and knows how to carry on the\\nbusiness of government.\\nA soldier in ^two of our wars, Mr. Welling makes it clear that\\nhis part in founding and vigorously conducting the National\\nSelf-Government Committee is the climax of the persistent,\\ncheerful, always good-humored even gay battle he has steadily\\nmaintained to help our country get the kind of citizens who will in\\nturn get the kind of civil servants, administrators, legislators that\\nwill establish the kind of government a democracy requires.\\nEducators will learn from this book how abstractions and theories\\nabout schools as the basis of democracy can be translated into\\nconcrete, practical brass-tack facts. Americans in every walk of\\nlife will be buoyed and refreshed by this vital story of a gallant\\nindomitable spirit. It comes at the time when it is needed.\\n  \\n                            \\n^Memorandum for Mr. Pringle [Typescript in the Henry Fowles Pringle Papers, General Correspondence, \"D\"fol-der,\\nfolder, box 1, Manuscript Division, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., 1942.]\\n»»\\n1. In view of the fact that the general public has little\\nrealization of the actual significance of Nazi domination of the\\ndaily life of persons who come under its control, I suggest there\\nbe a concrete statement of what we are fighting against, in terms\\nof what happens to the average man (and woman) in their daily\\nlife wherever Nazi wins. Perhaps a beginning could be made in\\nterms of imagining here in our own country complete control of\\nall newspapers, books, etc.; then of theater, radio, amusements,\\nsports; what would happen in our schools and to our children;\\nchurches and priests and pastors; also courts, police and\\nadministration of \"justice\"; all with a picture of the amount of spying,\\ntattling and petty interference involved. Something should be\\nincluded of course relative to control of industry and labor. People\\nwith expert knowledge can give the material. My suggestion is\\nsimply that the story be told in terms of what would happen here\\nin this country and the methods by which it would be carried out\\nin terms of the life of the ordinary citizen, man, woman and\\nchild, in the various aspects of daily life.\\n2. The fact that people who want to go about their own\\naffairs, work, play and contacts with others are now living under\\nconstant threat from nations whose governments are bent on\\nextension of their ways of life by means of military conquest, and\\nthat this menace will hang over us until the axis nations have\\nbeen defeated and some kind of world organization effected in\\nthe postwar period to prevent the rise of militaristic nations,\\nshould I think be strongly emphasized. We cannot lead a normal\\nlife as long as this state of things continues. Germany\\'s early\\nsuccesses, her continuing strength, and the headstart of Japan prove\\n  \\n                            \\nthat peoples who want to engage in the normal activities of living\\nare at a great disadvantage in comparison with nations who have\\nat their disposal all modern technological agencies and resources\\nand who organize these for imposing control and regimentation\\nby conquest. Anything approaching a stalemate (to say nothing\\nof victory by the axis powers) would impose upon us the\\nnecessity of changing our way of living so as to be ready at any time to\\nmeet the militarized powers, whose strength in war depends\\nupon organized regimentation of every phase of the life of the\\nordinary man, woman and child. (It is this thing which is new in\\nthe world, and which makes the menace of axis powers so much\\nmore terrible than the kind of militarism we fought in the first\\nworld war. The existence of techniques for regulating every act\\nand almost every thought of every one for a single end is new,\\nand Nazi Germany has demonstrated it is possible to unify and\\norganize these techniques.)\\nHence this second point links up with the first. Even if\\nGermany should not actually invade this country nor actually defeat\\nthis country and yet should win the war against European\\nnations we should be compelled to adopt increasingly as means of\\nself-defense against further aggression more and more of Nazi\\nmethods and would be gradually Nazified, even against our will\\nand perhaps almost without knowing it, in our way of living.\\nIndustry, commerce, education, political methods, everything,\\nwould be radically altered.\\nI haven\\'t said anything about war for freedom or for a\\ndemocratic way of life in the foregoing. But I think the line indicated\\nserves to take these ideas out of the field of generalities into what\\nthey concretely mean in the life of the average person.\\n  \\n                            \\n^Tribute to S. J. Woolf [Typescript in Dewey VFM 80, Special Collections, Morris Library, SouthernIlli-nois\\nIllinois University at Carbondale, 1935.]\\n»»\\nThe many readers of Mr. Woolf\\'s reports of interviews\\nwith statesmen, writers, and artists are aware of his power to\\nportray in words the salient traits of the ideas of the men who\\ntalk to him. Readers know also of his power to convey the\\nintangibles, the atmosphere in which men live and do their work. His\\nreports are remarkably free from the descriptions of petty details\\nin which many interviewers revel. When he describes the\\nsurroundings of the man with whom he is dealing, one feels their\\nrelevancy to the man and to his work. His capacity to sketch in a\\nfew words the background of what a man says, political, literary\\nor whatever, is due to the fact that Mr. Woolf himself comes to\\nthe interview with a large and well-informed background. I am\\nsure many who have taken part in these interviews will agree\\nwith me that Mr. Woolf\\'s own share in them makes them\\noccasions of agreeable give-and-take.\\nThe features that mark Mr. Woolf\\'s reports are evident in his\\nsketches. They show the same insight into fundamentals, the\\nsame power of selection and elimination, the same power of\\nrapid and terse summary. They are valuable records of many\\ntraits of contemporary life. But they also evince the essential\\nmarks of the genuine artist.\\n  \\n                            \\nStatement on Retirement of Frank Becker [Typescript in the Theodore T. Lafferty Papers, South Caroliniana Library,Uni-versity\\nUniversity of South Carolina, Columbia, 1950.]\\n»»\\nI count it a privilege to be invited to have a share in this\\noccasion, for although I am not present physically I am\\npermitted to have the great satisfaction of expressing the regards,\\nthe admiration, and the affection for Frank Becker of his one-\\ntime teacher, and of one who in spite of much too infrequent\\npersonal contacts in the intervening years has cherished not only his\\nmemory but a vision of him as a teacher to whom philosophy\\nwas living interest and vital concern, not a parlor game nor yet a\\nset of exercises to be performed in a gymnasium for training in\\nabstractions. I share with you, his students and colleagues, the\\nsense of loss that casts its shadow on this evening\\'s gathering. But\\nI also share with you the happy confidence that his work will live\\non in the hearts and minds of those who have learned with him\\nand from him the very best things that philosophy can convey to\\nanyone, anywhere. From my memory of him as a student and as\\na human being and from what I have seen of him in our\\naltogether too rare contacts in the passing years, as well as from\\nwhat I have heard of him from others, I know he has infused his\\nteaching of philosophy with personal qualities which have\\nrendered the subject human and humanly liberating. The qualities\\nof straightforward genuineness united with a friendliness of\\ndisposition that is only too rare did not desert him I am sure, when\\nhe came to Lehigh as a teacher. While you will miss his direct\\npresence in the class-room in days to come, the radiation of\\nphilosophy lifted out of abstractions into vitality as it was imbued\\nwith his personality will stay with you. I am happy to join with\\nyou in grateful memories of past contacts and in wishing for the\\n  \\n                            \\nteacher whose psychological and moral ties with you will never\\nbe severed all of the good things in his future he so abundantly\\nhas earned. To you Professor Frank Becker, Hail and Fare You\\nWell, not in the sense of departure and leaving but for a future\\nwhich, like the past, will be one of happiness and success because\\none of service to your fellow-beings.\\n  \\n                            \\nAddendum: The Value of Historical Christianity '"

If the following paper in the reading\\nleaves with the reader the impression of a miscellaneous\\ncollection, not of an organic unity, it will hardly be worth\\nwhile for me here to iterate that it is an attempt to apply a\\nsingle social philosophy, a single educational philosophy, to\\na single problem manifested in forms that are only outwardly\\ndiverse. I may, however, be allowed to say that in each case\\nI have tried to interpret the particular member of the school\\norganism dealt with in its twofold relation: to the past which\\nhas determined its conditions and forms; and to the present\\nwhich determines its aims and results—its ideals and its\\nsuccess or failure in realizing them. The school more than\\nany one other social institution stands between the past and\\nthe future; it is the living present as reflection of the past\\nand as prophecy of the future. To this is due the intensity\\nof intellectual and moral interest attaching to all that \\nconcerns the school—if only our eyes are open to see.\\n  \\n                            \\n1.
