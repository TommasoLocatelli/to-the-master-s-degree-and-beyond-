       "  'Early Essays\\nThe Metaphysical Assumptions of Materialism [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVI\\n(April 1882), 208-13. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nDiscussions regarding materialism have been, for the most\\npart, confined to the physiological and psychological aspects\\nof it. Its supporters and opponents have been content to\\nadduce arguments pro or con, as the facts of physical and\\nmental life bear upon the case in hand. It is the object of the\\npresent paper to discuss its metaphysical phases.\\nHume suggested that possibly one might escape from\\nthe nihilistic consequences of his philosophy by means of\\n\"the sceptical solution of sceptical doubts.\" In a somewhat\\nanalogous manner we would attempt to render explicit the\\nmetaphysical assumptions (i.e., assumptions regarding the\\nreal nature of things) latent in all materialism, and, by\\nshowing the relation of these fundamental assumptions to\\nmaterialism itself, show the self-destructive character of\\nevery scheme of this kind—whether actual or possible.\\nWhat is materialism? It is that theory which declares\\nthat matter and its forces adequately account for all°phenom-ena\\nphenomena-those of the material world, commonly so called, and\\nthose of life, mind, and society. It declares that not only the\\ncontent of mind, but that which we call mind itself, is\\ndetermined by matter. We notice first, then, that it is°abso-lutely\\nabsolutely monistic. But one substance exists-matter. All°phe-nomena\\nphenomena of mind are really phenomena of matter. The°intel-lect\\nintellect is a function of the brain and its subordinate nervous\\norgans. The laws of matter are therefore the laws of mind.\\nMental phenomena are expressible in terms of material. And\\nsince all material phenomena are expressible in terms of the\\n\\n ― 4 ―\\n                            \\natom and molecule (or whatever names be given to the°ulti-mate\\nultimate forms of matter), therefore all mental are similarly°ex-pressible\\nexpressible. The ultimate form of matter contains, then,°implic-itly\\nimplicitly, all phenomena of mind and society. In short, the coarsest\\nform of matter with which you can begin, as well as the\\nhighest organism with which you end, must contain all\\nemotion, volition, and knowledge, the knowing subject and\\nits relations. Beginning, then, with a strictly monistic°the-ory\\ntheory, and keeping directly in the line of materialistic°reason-ing\\nreasoning, we have ended with the conclusion that the ultimate\\nform of matter has dualistic \"mind\" and \"matter\"°prop-erties\\nproperties. Nor is there any escape from this conclusion on a\\nmaterialistic basis. Therefore on its physical or constructive\\nside we find such a theory suicidal.\\nTo be sure, a materialist might reply that ultimately\\nthe \"matter\"-molecular-property accounted for and caused\\nthe \"mind\"-molecular-property, but proof, or suggestion of\\nproof, or suggestion as to method of finding proof, all are\\nequally absent. If a materialist were to say that this double-\\nsided substance is what he means by matter, we could only\\nreply that he is playing with words—that it is just as much\\nmind as it is matter.\\nWe have now to consider the strictly metaphysical\\nassumptions of materialism.\\nFirst, it assumes the possibility of ontological°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, by which we mean knowledge of being or substance\\napart from a mere succession of phenomena. The substance\\nwhich is so known is matter. Now, since it is this statement\\nthat a belief in the possibility of ontological knowledge is an\\ninherent necessity in all materialistic reasoning, which is the\\nbasis of our criticism, the statement must be examined more\\nfully. Suppose for the moment that it is not such an inherent\\nnecessity—that it is possible to found materialism on°some-thing\\nsomething besides an ontological basis. If there be no knowledge\\nof substance as such, there is either only knowledge of\\nphenomena produced by the activity of the Ego (pure\\nsubjective idealism), or of phenomena entirely unrelated to\\nany substance whatever (Humian scepticism), or of those\\nrelated only to objective spirit (Berkeleian idealism), or of\\nthose related to an unknown and unknowable substance (H.\\n\\n ― 5 ―\\n                            \\nSpencer), or of those brought into unity by the forms of\\nknowledge which the mind necessarily imposes on all°phe-nomena\\nphenomena given in consciousness (as Kant). Now, since none\\nof these can afford a sufficient basis for a theory, which posits\\nmatter as the universal underlying unity, we must admit\\nthat materialism exists on the basis of a belief in the°possibil-ity\\npossibility of ontological knowledge of such objective reality. If a\\nmaterialist, who still believes that we have no knowledge of\\nsubstance as such, replies that while we have knowledge of\\nphenomena only, yet we know them as the effects of matter,\\nthe answer is obvious. Either we know this substance,°mat-ter\\nmatter, which is the cause of them, or we do not. If we do, it is\\nontological knowledge. If we do not, then it is as much\\nassumption to claim that it is matter as it would be to name\\nit mind. We must conclude, therefore, that a knowledge\\ntranscending phenomena is the sole thinkable basis for°mate-rialism\\nmaterialism.\\nStarting from this, we have to consider the relation of\\nsuch knowledge to materialism. What is involved in°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of matter as substance?\\nTo know, requires something which knows. To know\\nmaterial phenomena, are required mental phenomena. A\\nthing is for the mind non-existent until it is an idea or\\nphenomenon of the mind. To know substance, matter, is\\nrequired substance, mind. If materialism merely posited\\nknowledge of material phenomena, there would be required\\nto give it validity only mental phenomena, which do, on\\nevery theory, exist. A theory, however, which posits°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of a substance besides, must also posit something more\\nthan phenomena in order to know this substance. If there be\\nno substance, mind, then there are only series of mental\\nstates or successions of mental phenomena. But it is a mere\\ntruism to say that phenomena cannot go beyond phenomena.\\nSuccessions of consciousnesses irrelated, or related only in\\ntime, can but give knowledge of phenomena similarly°re-lated\\nrelated. Undoubtedly the former may be but subjective, while\\nthe latter are objective, but that does not constitute°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of substance. To have real knowledge of real being,\\nthere must be something which abides through the°succes-sive\\nsuccessive states, and which perceives their relations to that being\\n\\n ― 6 ―\\n                            \\nand to itself. To say that the mind, if itself a mere°phenome-non\\nphenomenon or group of phenomena, can transcend phenomena and\\nobtain a knowledge of that reality which accounts both for\\nother phenomena and for itself, is absurd. But there is no\\nneed to multiply words to show what is, after all,°self-evi-dent\\nself-evident—that phenomenal knowledge is phenomenal, and that\\nto transcend phenomena there must be something besides a\\nphenomenon. We find materialism, then, in this position. To\\nprove that mind is a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to\\nassume the possibility of ontological knowledge—i.e., real\\nknowledge of real being; but in that real knowledge is\\nnecessarily involved a subject which knows. To prove that\\nmind is a phenomenon, it is obliged to implicitly assume that\\nit is a substance. Could there be anything more°self-destruc-tive\\nself-destructive?\\nSecondly, it assumes the reality of the causal nexus,\\nand the possibility of knowledge of real causation. In°declar-ing\\ndeclaring that matter causes mind, it declares that the relation is\\none of efficiency and dependency, and not one of succession\\n—antecedent and consequent. For, if it be the latter, then\\nthere are only succession and conjunction of material and\\nmental phenomena, irrelated or related only in time, in\\nwhich case it would be absurd to say that matter caused\\nmind.\\nWe have therefore to consider what is involved in real\\ncausation, and the knowledge of it as such, and what°rela-tion\\nrelation the involved facts bear to the theory of materialism.\\nHow, on a materialistic hypothesis, can the knowledge\\nof a real causal nexus be obtained? It cannot be a primary,\\nnecessary intuition of the human mind, nor yet a universal\\nmode of viewing things, for both of these imply the reality of\\nsubstantial mind. Nor can it be a concept obtained from\\nexperience, and generalized by unconscious habit. For, in\\nthe first place, such a concept is necessarily subjective, and\\nbelongs only to the mind which framed it. It may or may not\\nobtain as an objective relation among objective things.\\nThere is no ground for positing objective validity of any\\nmental conception, except by a priori mind necessity, which\\na materialistic theory must reject. But, secondly, and\\nchiefly, such a theory as to the origin of a knowledge of the\\n\\n ― 7 ―\\n                            \\ncausal nexus contains a petitio principii—i.e., it presupposes\\nreal causation to account for our knowledge of real°causa-tion\\ncausation. For this generalized belief, being a result of experience,\\nis itself an effect of the phenomena given in experience. To\\nensure, therefore, that it is a true concept—i.e., one holding\\ngood objectively—we must assume that it was produced by a\\ntrue causal nexus, which in turn is the thing to be accounted\\nfor. It certainly is begging the question to say that our\\nknowledge that causation is real is a result of experience,\\nwhen to prove that experience can produce a correct result\\nwe have to assume that very reality of causation which is to\\nbe proved. Nothing can be more illogical than to deduce\\nknowledge of real causation from that which has for its own\\nbasis that same reality. After accounting for the one, the\\nother still remains to be accounted for, which can be done\\nonly by reasoning in a circle. There is yet available one\\nresource to materialism—to claim that, although our°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of true causation is not generalized from a series of\\nexperiences, it is obtained directly from the knowledge of\\nphenomena—that in any two or more phenomena there is\\nalso given the causal nexus and the knowledge of it. Now,\\nwe might object to this, that it approached the position of\\nthe strictest intuitionalist, and that, as mere phenomena,\\nthere is in them nothing but the relation of co-existence and\\nsuccession. Objective phenomena are not labelled \"this is\\nthe cause of that\"; and, therefore, if the mind thinks it finds\\nin them such a relation, that relation must be brought to the\\nphenomena by the mind itself. Or we might also say that, if\\na series of experiences is incompetent (as we have seen it is)\\nto give a knowledge of causation, on a materialistic°hypothe-sis\\nhypothesis, a fortiori, a single experience is. But waiving these, we\\nhave to see what is contained in this theory, granting the\\ntruth of materialism. According to it, the knowledge of these\\nobjects, and that of the causal nexus between them, is the\\nresult of matter, and therefore is a dependent \"effect\"—the\\nfirst effect in the perfect blank, which is to change that\\nblank into what we call mind and its content. (The first,\\nbecause by the theory the knowledge of causation, not being\\nderived from experiences, must be contained in the first two\\nphenomena given in consciousness.) But as an effect it is, of\\n\\n ― 8 ―\\n                            \\ncourse, a phenomenon, and for a phenomenon to transcend\\nphenomena, and attain the reality behind them, is, as before\\nshown, impossible. Ontological knowledge is not possible to\\nthe mind when the mind is considered as a phenomenal\\neffect. Knowledge of causation cannot be reached, then, on a\\nmaterialistic theory, either through experiences or a single\\nexperience without intuitional or ontological knowledge.\\nOnly one way remains—that it should be reached through\\nthe activity of the Ego itself. The mind is a true cause, and\\ngives knowledge of true causation. So, to prove mind and\\neffect, materialism would have to postulate it as a cause. It is\\nagain suicidal.\\nTo sum up: To prove a strict monism, materialism has\\nto assume an original irresolvable dualism. To prove the\\nmind a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to assume a\\nsubstance to give knowledge of that matter. To prove that it\\nis an effect of matter, it is obliged to assume either an\\nintuitional power of mind, or that mind is itself a cause, both\\nequally destructive of materialism.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that as a philosophical theory\\nmaterialism has proved itself a complete felo-de-se. To°af-ford\\nafford itself a thinkable basis, it assumes things which°thor-oughly\\nthoroughly destroy the theory.\\n\\n ― 9 ―\\n                            \\nThe Pantheism of Spinoza [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVI\\n(July 1882), 249-57. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe problem of philosophy is to determine the meaning of\\nthings as we find them, or of the actual. Since these things\\nmay be gathered under three heads, the problem becomes:\\nto determine the meaning of Thought, Nature, and God,\\nand the relations of one to another. The first stage of\\nthought being Dogmatism, the first philosophy will be that\\nof the common uneducated mind-Natural Realism. God,\\nself, and the world are three independent realities, and the\\nmeaning of each is just what it seems to be. If, however,\\nthey are independent realities, how can they relate to each\\nother? This question gives rise to the second stage of°Dog-matic\\nDogmatic Philosophy, which, according to the mind of the\\nholder, takes either the direction of Dogmatic Idealism or a\\nDualism with God as the Deus ex Machina, like that of\\nDescartes. The reconciliation of the elements here involved\\nleads to the third stage, where God becomes the Absolute,\\nand Nature and Self are but his manifestations. This is\\nPantheism, and the view-point of Spinoza. Thought and\\nbeing become one; the order of thought is the order of\\nexistence. Now a final unity seems obtained, and real°knowl-edge\\nknowledge possible.\\nThe problem of philosophy being to determine the\\nmeaning of the Actual, its final test must be the°complete-ness\\ncompleteness with which its answer agrees with and accounts for the\\nActual. By this we do not mean, of course, that its°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation must agree with the common interpretation. There is\\ncertainly no shadow of reason for supposing that the°meta-physic\\nmetaphysic of the uneducated mind is the final one to which all\\nmetaphysic must conform. But every philosophy must°an-swer\\n ― 10 ―\\n                            \\nanswer this question: Does it provide the factors which in their\\ndevelopment account for the Actual as it is interpreted by\\nthat theory, and for other interpretations also? In short, it\\nmust account not only for things as they are, but also as they\\nseem to be. To stop at the first point is simply to beg the\\nquestion. The best answer to any question is the one which\\nenables you to understand and to account for all other°possi-ble\\npossible answers.\\nHas Spinoza done this? It must be confessed that to\\nmany minds he seems to have done so. That we may attempt\\nto see whether he has or not, let us state the problem again.\\nIt is to reconcile the Infinite, and the apparent finite, by the\\nhypothesis of the Infinite alone; to show the unity between\\nthe Absolute and the seeming relative by the hypothesis of\\nthe Absolute alone. A hard task; but in reading the Ethics of\\nSpinoza, we seem to find it accomplished, and the two°ele-ments\\nelements, side by side, deduced from a common principle. To\\naid the mind to determine whether this accomplishment is\\nonly seeming, or is real, is our object now.\\nWe shall endeavor to show that the solution of the\\nproblem by Spinoza, the reconciliation of the two elements,\\nis brought about only by the assumption of contradictory\\nelements in his premises, and the surreptitious bringing in\\nof new ones as he proceeds. As we begin, we can do so with\\nno better thought than that of Kant. A system which°pro-ceeds\\nproceeds geometrically, like Spinoza\\'s, must either draw°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic or analytic conclusions, the analytic being conclusions\\nwhich simply unfold what was already contained in the\\ngiven conceptions, the synthetic being those which go°be-yond\\nbeyond the given ones and add something to them. If the\\nformer, then, unless you would beg the whole question, you\\nmust show the validity and reality of your definitions; if the\\nlatter, you must show whence you obtain your material for\\ngoing outside of the given conceptions. We shall endeavor to\\nshow the existence of contradictory elements in Spinoza\\'s\\npremises, not by a direct examination of them, but indirectly\\nby drawing from them conclusions in plainest contradiction\\nto those which he draws.\\nThe object of the First Part of Spinoza\\'s Ethics, \"De\\nDeo,\" is to demonstrate the existence of one substance°infi-nite\\n ― 11 ―\\n                            \\ninfinite in infinite attributes, and to show the relation of this\\nsubstance to finite things-viz., that they are but its°acci-dents\\naccidents. That our exposition may be as clear as possible, we\\nshall for the occasion adopt Spinoza\\'s method, and, taking\\nhis axioms and definitions as our premises, draw conclusions\\nfrom them in geometrical form. To distinguish, our°proposi-tions\\npropositions will be designated by Arabic, and Spinoza\\'s by Roman\\nnumerals.\\nDefinit. I. By that which is the cause of itself I°under-stand\\nunderstand that whose essence involves existence, or that whose\\nnature can only be conceived as existent.\\nII. That thing is said to be finite in its kind which can\\nbe limited by another of the same nature.\\nIII.

A true idea must agree with the object°repre-sented\\nrepresented.\\nVII. The essence of whatever can be conceived as non-\\nexistent does not involve existence.\\nProp. 1. An attribute must be conceived through°it-self\\nitself, and through itself alone.\\nDem. An attribute is that which the intellect perceives\\nto constitute the essence of substance (Def. 4), and hence\\nmust be conceived through itself (Def. 3), which was the\\nfirst point; and through itself alone; for if an attribute could\\nbe conceived through something else, since it constitutes the\\nessence of substance, a substance could be also thus°con-ceived\\nconceived, which is absurd (Def. 3). Therefore, etc.\\nProp. 2. No attribute can possess a mode.\\nDem. A mode, if it exist, is an accident of substance or\\n(since attribute constitutes the essence of substance) of\\nattribute, or that which is in something else, by whose\\nmeans it must be conceived (Def. 5). But an attribute must\\nbe conceived through itself alone (Prop. 1), and hence\\ncannot possess a mode. Q.E.D.\\nProp. 3. Nothing exists but attributes and modes.\\nDem. For all things can be conceived only through\\nthemselves or through something else. But that which is\\nconceived through itself is an attribute (Defs. 4 and 3, or\\nProp. 1), and that which is conceived through something\\nelse is a mode. Therefore, etc.\\nCor. 1. Nothing exists but attributes. If not, suppose\\nsomething else exists, which (by preceding Prop.) must be\\na mode. But since a mode (Def. 5) cannot be in itself alone,\\nit must be in something else (Ax. 1), which can only be an\\nattribute, since nothing else exists. But this is absurd, since\\n(Prop. 2) no attribute can possess a mode. Therefore, etc.\\nCor. 2. Things can be distinguished only by their°at-tributes\\nattributes. For nothing else exists.\\nCor. 3. Two or more attributes of the same nature\\ncannot be given. For since things (preceding Cor.) can be\\ndistinguished only by their attributes, if there were two of\\nthe same nature they could not be distinguished—i.e., would\\nbe one and the same (Ax. 4). Therefore, etc.\\n\\n ― 13 ―\\n                            \\nProp. 4. Every attribute is infinite.\\nDem. For if finite it must be limited by an attribute\\n(Cor. 1, Prop. 3) of the same nature (Def. 2), which is\\nimpossible (Cor. 3, Prop. 3). Therefore, etc.\\nCor. There are no finite things. For nothing exists but\\nattributes (Cor. 1, Prop. 3), and they are all infinite.\\nScholium. It will now be immediately seen that we\\nhave arrived at a denial of one of Spinoza\\'s fundamental\\nconclusions-viz., the existence of finite things as modes or\\naccidents of God. It has not been sufficiently pointed out, I\\nthink, how surreptitiously Spinoza introduces this°concep-tion\\nconception. It will be found in Prop. XXVIII, where he states that\\nany particular thing which is finite, and has a determined\\nexistence, cannot exist or be determined to action except it\\nbe so determined by another finite object similarly°deter-mined\\ndetermined, and so on infinitely. But it will be noticed that this is\\na conditional judgment, stating only that if there are finite\\nthings, they are so determined. But the very question is: are\\nthere such finite objects? and Spinoza only assumes that. He\\nhas made his synthetic judgment only by smuggling in one\\nof the very things to be accounted for. The question as to\\nhow finite objects are determined possesses no relevancy or\\nvalidity until it is shown that finite objects can exist at all.\\nBut Spinoza proceeds as if his conditional judgment°pos-sessed\\npossessed validity not only in its conclusion, but also with\\nregard to its predicate—the existence of finite things. In\\nshort, he begs the whole question, and the greater part of his\\nsecond book rests ultimately on this petitio. An examination\\nof the demonstration of this 28th Prop. will show what\\nconclusion Spinoza ought to have arrived at regarding the\\nexistence of the predicate of his major premise. He first\\nshows, by reference to previous propositions, that whatever\\nhas been determined has been so determined by God, and\\nthat a finite thing cannot be produced from the absolute\\nnature of any attribute of God, nor from any attribute°modi-fied\\nmodified with a modification which is eternal and infinite. Hence,\\nhe concludes, it must be produced by some modification\\nwhich is finite. In other words, the condition of a finite thing\\nis a finite thing, and so regressively in an infinite series. In\\nother words, again, the existence of finite things is not\\naccounted for at all; it is only assumed. The conclusion he\\n\\n ― 14 ―\\n                            \\nshould have drawn is the following: A finite thing, if it\\nexist, must depend upon another finite, and so on forever.\\nHence God, since he is infinite, could never cause a finite\\nthing; but since he is the cause of everything, no finite thing\\ncould be caused at all, or have existence. Hence the°hypothe-sis\\nhypothesis is false. That Spinoza did not see that this was the only\\nconclusion to be logically drawn from his arguments, shows\\nhow completely his mind was preoccupied with the realistic\\nassumptions which he had unconsciously derived from°pre-vious\\nprevious systems. In a similar way we may demonstrate that the\\nhypothesis regarding determination to action or change\\nmust be false if we admit the previous conclusions. For they\\nshow that no attribute can change, or produce change, since\\nit is eternal and immutable (Cor. 2, Prop. xx). And if a\\nmode can change, the change must depend upon a change in\\nsome other mode, and so on in an infinite regression. That\\nis, God could not produce the first change, which is absurd.\\nTherefore, the hypothesis of change is absurd.\\nProp. 5. One attribute cannot be produced by another.\\nDem. For since they have nothing in common (Cor. 3,\\nProp. 3) they cannot be conceived through each other (Ax.\\n5), and, accordingly, one cannot be the cause of another\\n(Ax. 4). Q.E.D.\\nProp. 6. It belongs to the nature of attributes to exist.\\nFor since one cannot be the cause of another°(preced-ing\\n(preceding Prop.), it must be its own cause—i.e. (Def. 1), it\\nbelongs to its nature to exist.\\nCor. Attributes are eternal (preceding Prop. and Def.\\n8).\\nProp. 7. An infinite number of attributes exist.\\nDem. If you deny it, imagine, if you can, that there is\\nnot an infinite number. Then the essence of each will not\\ninclude existence, which is absurd (Prop. 6). Therefore, the\\nhypothesis is absurd, and an infinite number, etc.\\nScholium. The reader will observe that this is precisely\\nthe argument of Spinoza in Prop. XXI regarding the°exist-ence\\nexistence of God.\\nProp. 8. An infinite number of substances exist.\\nDem. Proved like the previous proposition, or\\nAliter. Since an infinite number of attributes exist,\\n\\n ― 15 ―\\n                            \\neach of which constitutes the essence of substance (Def. 4),\\nan infinite number of substances must exist.\\nCor. God, or one substance with an infinite number of\\nattributes, does not exist.\\nScholium. The reader who may have been prepared for\\nthe demonstration that the existence of finite things was\\ncontradictory to the remainder of Spinoza\\'s philosophy, will\\nperhaps be surprised to see this denial of God\\'s existence,\\nand think that it may depend upon some trickery of words,\\nand not be logically involved in Spinoza\\'s premises. But that\\nit is, may be shown, I think. In Prop. XI, where he attempts\\nto prove the existence of only one substance of infinite°attri-butes\\nattributes, he really proves only the existence of an infinite°num-ber\\nnumber of substances, or of an infinite number of attributes. The\\nsubsumption of these latter under unity is entirely°unjusti-fied\\nunjustified by anything in the proposition. In scholium of Prop. X\\nhe seems to realize the difficulty of having an infinity of\\nattributes belonging to one and the same substance, but\\nattempts to escape from it by saying that nothing could be\\nclearer than that the more reality or being anything has, the\\nmore attributes it must have, and hence a being absolutely\\ninfinite must have an infinity of attributes. This would be\\ntrue if he had before proved that for substance, as he defines\\nit, to have such a number was possible, or implied no°contra-diction\\ncontradiction. But he has not done this, and it may be shown in the\\nfollowing that he cannot. An attribute is that which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes the essence of substance. Hence, if there are two or\\nmore attributes (a fortiori, if an infinity) in the same°sub-stance\\nsubstance, they must either constitute different essences, which\\nis absurd, or the same essence, in which case they will be one\\nand the same attribute. Two things only are possible to\\nSpinoza. He may have either an infinite number of attributes\\nexisting in entire independence of each other, hence°consti-tuting\\nconstituting an infinite number of substances; or one infinite°sub-stance\\nsubstance, with one infinite attribute. But to unite the two°con-ceptions\\nconceptions involves contradiction, as before shown. Yet this is\\nwhat he does practically, using either, as the exigencies of\\nthe case require.\\nWe now see Spinoza as a magician, supplied with his\\nconjuring material. With two infinites—one the very°nega-tion\\n ― 16 ―\\n                            \\nnegation of the finite, the other existing only in relation to the\\nfinite; with two substances—one with a number of attributes,\\nthe other with but one—he can proceed by dexterous°substi-tutions\\nsubstitutions to produce any required results before our astonished\\neyes.\\nThis concludes our examination of Part First. We hope\\nthat our original statement regarding the existence of°con-tradictions\\ncontradictions in the premises, and the introduction of new\\nconceptions from without, will be seen to be justified. The\\ncontradiction is now seen to be this: In definitions three and\\nfour a substance is posited which can be conceived only,\\nand, consequently, can exist only in itself, constituted by\\nattributes necessarily existing in the same manner. But in\\nthe fifth we have the idea of something which can exist in\\nsomething else. If the third and fourth are accepted, this\\nlatter must be necessarily denied, unless we hold that there\\nexists something besides substance and mode, which is°con-tradictory\\ncontradictory to the first and second axioms. The similar°contra-diction\\ncontradiction between the two former and the sixth has been\\nsufficiently brought out in the scholium to our last°proposi-tion\\nproposition.\\nIt would not be much better than a waste of time to\\nfollow Spinoza through his other Parts and show that in\\nevery case his apparent reconciliation of the finite and the\\ninfinite is brought about either by the introduction of the\\nthing to be accounted for, or that it is contradictory to some\\nother part of his system, or both. The clew is now in the\\npossession of the reader, and any one who wishes to, may\\ndevelop it at length.\\nWe wish, however, to simply direct attention to a few\\npoints in Part Second, \"De Mente.\" Axiom fifth of this\\nbook, upon which he relies for his proof that the object of\\nthe idea which constitutes the real existence of the human\\nmind is the body (see Prop. XIII, Pt. 2), declares that we\\nneither feel, nor perceive, any particular objects except°bod-ies\\nbodies and modes of thought. But Prop. XVI, Pt. 1, declares that\\ninfinite things in infinite modes must exist, from each of\\nwhich (Prop. XXXVI, Pt. 1) some effect must necessarily\\nfollow, which effect must involve the knowledge of its cause\\n(Ax. 4, Pt. 1). Again, as the first book attempted to explain\\n\\n ― 17 ―\\n                            \\nfinite things as accidents of substance, so the second°at-tempts\\nattempts to explain error as nothing positive, but simply°inad-equacy\\ninadequacy or privation. To do this he is obliged to assume three\\nkinds of Gods. First, God in so far as he is infinite (Prop. XI,\\nCor.: quatenus infinitus est), in so far as he constitutes the\\nessence of the human mind (ibid.: quatenus humanæ Mentis\\nessentiam constituit), and in so far as he is considered as\\naffected with the idea of a particular object actually existing\\n(Prop. IX, quatenus rei singularis actu existentis idea°affec-tus\\naffectus consideratur). It is needless to say that these different\\nnotions are either meaningless or else contradictory to each\\nother, and brought in as the exigencies of the case happen to\\nrequire one rather than the other. But the reader can easily\\ndemonstrate for himself, that error, even in the sense of\\nprivation or inadequate knowledge, is impossible by using\\nthe propositions of the first book. Another contradiction may\\nbe shown as follows: In the scholium to Prop. XV he shows\\nthat matter can be regarded as divisible, or composed of\\nparts, only in so far as it relates to the imagination; but in\\nthe second book, when he comes to account for the°imagina-tion\\nimagination, he is obliged to assume these same parts for an°ade-quate\\nadequate explanation (see the Postulates, and Props. XV, XVI,\\nXVII, with Cor. and scholium, of Pt. 2).\\nIn truth, Spinoza is a juggler who keeps in stock two\\nGods—one the perfect infinite and absolute being, the other\\nthe mere sum of the universe with all its defects as they\\nappear to us. When he wishes to show God as the adequate\\ncause of all, to explain truth, inculcate morality, his°legerde-main\\nlegerdemain brings the First before us; when finite things, change,\\nerror, etc., are to be accounted for, his Second appears—the\\nGod who does things not in so far as he is Infinite, and who\\nis affected with the idea of finite things.\\nWe might have known, a priori, that such°contradic-tions\\ncontradictions must occur in a pantheistic system like Spinoza\\'s. It\\nrests upon the basis that the only real knowledge is°immedi-ate\\nimmediate knowledge. In this case the Absolute becomes mere\\nBeing, an Abstract Universal, possessed with no°determina-tions\\ndeterminations whatever, for determinations are negations. Such,\\nwhen Spinoza is truly logical, is his God. But, in this case,\\nhe cannot account for particular concrete objects. The two\\n\\n ― 18 ―\\n                            \\nelements are necessarily irreconcilable from such a stand-\\npoint as Spinoza\\'s regarding knowledge.\\nTwo logical pantheistic systems are possible. One must\\nstart with the conception of an Absolute Perfect Being in\\nwhom are all things, but this theory cannot account for\\nthings as we find them. It must deny that they are what they\\nseem to be, and elevate them into the Divine. But the rock on\\nwhich every such theory must split is the problem: If, then,\\nall things are divine, how, then, do they appear to us°other-wise\\notherwise? Here is where Spinoza failed. The other theory must\\nstart from the conception of things as they seem to be, and\\nproduce its Pantheism, not by elevating them into God, but\\nby bringing God down to them. Such a theory, of course,\\ncan never arrive at the conception of the Absolute, the\\nPerfect, and the Infinite. Strictly speaking, it is not°Panthe-ism\\nPantheism at all; it is Pancosmism. But this is not a solution; it is\\nmerely an assumption of all that is to be explained.\\n\\n ― 19 ―\\n                            \\nKnowledge and the Relativity of Feeling [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVII\\n(Jan. 1883), 56-70. Not reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nThe doctrine of the Relativity of Knowledge is one of the\\nmost characteristic theories of modern thought. To many,\\nindeed, it seems the sum of all modern wisdom. That we\\ncannot know Being, but must confine ourselves to sequences\\namong phenomena—this appears to many the greatest\\nachievement of thought: a discovery whose full meaning it\\nwas reserved for the Nineteenth Century to penetrate, and\\none which, if mastered, will put an end to all the idle\\nspeculation which is supposed to have disgraced the°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical thought of the past, and turn intellectual activity\\ninto the fruitful fields of real knowledge.\\nThe doctrine has been reached in at least four different\\nways, and held by as many schools. There is the Positivist,\\nwho claims to have reached the doctrine as the result of\\nhistory, and not from any system of Metaphysics, and who is\\namong the loudest in proclaiming it the panacea for all ills\\nwhich intellect is heir to. There is the school who profess to\\nhave reached it from a philosophical examination of thought\\nitself, and to have found it involved in \"imbecilities\" at\\nevery attempt to overstep phenomena-the school whose\\nchief representative is Hamilton, but more lately given to\\ncalling up the greater shade of Kant to conjure by. Then\\nthere is the Associationalist, who, after Hume had made\\nwreck of Sensationalism by showing that its methods and\\npresuppositions left no basis for any objective knowledge—\\nno, nor for objective existence either-had before him the\\nsorry task of keeping the method and yet avoiding the result.\\n\\n ― 20 ―\\n                            \\nHis instrument was the \"association of ideas,\" and by it he\\nattempted to reach results compatible with every-day\\nthought and the established facts of physical science. But to\\nwhatever extent he succeeded (and we are not concerned\\nwith that question at present), he found himself confined\\nwithin the limits of his subjective capacity for association,\\nand he, too, took Relativity for his shibboleth.\\nBut with the development of the theory of evolution\\narose a school that wielded a mightier weapon. Here was an\\nestablished scientific theory which assumed objective°exist-ence\\nexistence, and also, in one of its highest generalizations, included\\nman, and showed that he, and presumably his intellect and\\nknowledge, had in the progress of the cycles been developed\\nfrom these original existences and forces. Here, then, is a\\ntheory which, in a certain form, may deny all creating and\\nconstructive thought, and consequently be thoroughly°sensa-tionalistic\\nsensationalistic. Furthermore, by extending indefinitely the\\nsphere and time of operations, it bridged the gaps and\\nstrengthened the weak points of former sensationalism; and,\\nabove all, it postulated objective existence. Here, then, is a\\ntheory which may satisfy the demands of physical science\\nand of \"common-sense\" as to existence independent of\\nsubjective feeling; pay a compliment to the former by°adopt-ing\\nadopting its methods and results, and at the same time forever\\nsilence all who claim that we have absolute knowledge. For,\\nnotice how this theory is also compelled to assume the form\\nof Relativity. According to it, in the form we are°consider-ing\\nconsidering, all knowledge is, through a nervous organism,°con-structed\\nconstructed through evolution from the lowest form of life, or\\nfrom matter. Accordingly, it must be conditioned by the\\nstate and quality of the organism, and cannot represent or\\ncopy objective existence. It is therefore relative to the°sub-ject\\nsubject. But since, according to the realistic assumptions of the\\ntheory, there is objective existence, this must remain forever\\nunknown and unknowable. To know it would be possible\\nonly through the contradiction of a feeling not relative to the\\nsubject. This, then, is the position of that form of the°doc-trine\\ndoctrine of the Relativity of Knowledge which is probably most\\nwidely influential at present. All knowledge is derived from\\nfeeling; feeling is conditioned upon the existence of external\\n\\n ― 21 ―\\n                            \\nobjects, and expresses the way in which the sentient subject\\nis affected by them, and not what they are in themselves. All\\nknowledge is through feeling, and all feeling is relative.\\nSuch are its dogmas.\\nWhat we intend in this paper is to examine into the\\ntheory of the Relativity of Knowledge in so far as it bases\\nitself upon the fact of the relativity of feeling to a subject.\\nWere we to examine it exhaustively in its relations to the\\ntheory of evolution, with which in its fourth form it is\\nconnected, it would be necessary to ask how the scientific\\ntheory of evolution, by hypothesis an exact and correct°state-ment\\nstatement of a universal law, is compatible with any such°sup-posed\\nsupposed origin of knowledge. But we pass over this for the\\npresent, and will inquire simply into the mutual relations of\\nthe two parts of any sensationalistic theory of the relativity\\nof knowledge.\\nThat we may have the work thoroughly before us, it\\nmust be noticed, first, that Relative here signifies subjective\\nas opposed to objective, phenomenal as opposed to°ontologi-cal\\nontological. It denotes an imperfection of thought, not its essence.\\nSecondly, this theory in its present form is not a°psychologi-cal\\npsychological theory. It does not simply state certain facts regarding\\nthe method in which we get to know the world, but claims to\\nbe a Philosophy, and so gives epistemological conclusions\\nregarding the knowableness of Being, and, therefore,°onto-logical\\nontological conclusions regarding the nature of Being, viz., that\\nit is unrelated to Thought.\\nPlausible as the theory seems at first sight, by reason\\nof its supposed basis in well-established scientific facts, it is\\nimpossible, upon further reflection, to suppress certain°ques-tionings\\nquestionings. These formulate themselves as follows: How is it\\npossible to assume at the same time the truth of the°sensa-tionalist\\nsensationalist hypothesis and that of the Relativity of Feeling?\\nAre these two doctrines ultimately reconcilable? Does not\\nthe possibility of knowing the relativity of our feelings imply\\nan element in knowledge besides these feelings? Could a\\nmerely feeling consciousness ever arrive at the knowledge\\nthat there were objects as referred to which its feelings were\\npurely relative? In a word: Can a consciousness made up\\nexclusively of feelings which are ex hypothesi relative ever\\n\\n ― 22 ―\\n                            \\ntranscend this relativity, and make assertions regarding an\\nabsolute object as referred to which alone they could be\\ntermed relative?\\nWhat I wish to present is some suggestions in answer\\nof this question; and incidentally, if possible, to throw some\\nlight upon the ultimate ontological bearings of any theory of\\nthe relativity of feeling.\\nIt is to be noticed, first, that this theory assumes that\\nthere is an absolute object or objects. There can be no\\nrelative except as referred to an Absolute. It is only by\\nassuming that there is something Non-relative that we can\\nknow our feelings to be relative. Relative and absolute are\\ncorrelate terms, and one without the other is meaningless, or\\nrather impossible. Were it not postulated that there is a\\nNon-relative existence as referred to which our present°ac-tual\\nactual feelings are relative, it is evident that the feelings°them-selves\\nthemselves would be the ultimate and absolute, thus°contradict-ing\\ncontradicting the hypothesis. There is no need to occupy space in\\nstating these truisms, for, besides their self-evident°charac-ter\\ncharacter, they are admitted, or rather claimed, by the chief°mod-ern\\nmodern representative of the doctrine we are examining. Says\\nMr. Spencer: \"The proposition, that whatever we feel has\\nan existence which is relative to ourselves only, cannot be\\nproved, nay, cannot even be intelligibly expressed, without\\nasserting directly, or by implication, an external existence\\nwhich is not relative to ourselves. . . .\" The hypothesis\\n\"that the active antecedents of each primary feeling exist\\nindependently of consciousness is the only thinkable one. It\\nis the one implicitly asserted in the very proposition that\\nfeelings are relative to our own nature, and it is taken for\\ngranted in every step of every argument by which the°propo-sition\\nproposition is proved\" (Spencer, Principles of Psychology, vol. i,\\npp. 208, 209). And, again: \"More certain than the relativity\\nof relations, as we conceive them, is the existence of°non-rel-ative\\nnon-relative forms to which they refer; since proof of the first\\ninvolves perpetual assumption of the last\" (Spencer, p.\\n227).\\nIt being admitted, then, that knowledge of the°relativ-ity\\nrelativity of feeling implies knowledge of a non-relative existence,\\nthe question arises as to the compatibility of this position\\n\\n ― 23 ―\\n                            \\nwith the theory it accompanies, viz., that all knowledge is\\nderived from feeling. Is it logically possible to hold that all\\nknowledge comes from feeling, and yet that there is°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of the existence of an Absolute? Rather, does not one\\nposition exclude the other? We will put the case in its\\nsimplest form. Either there is knowledge of something\\nNon-relative or there is not. If the latter be the case, then, as\\nwe have already seen, the relativity of feeling could never be\\nknown, nay, the question as to its relativity could never have\\noccurred to consciousness. The former alternative is the one\\nadopted. We must admit that there is knowledge of the\\nexistence of an absolute object. But how is this knowledge\\nobtained? Since all knowledge comes from feeling, this must\\nalso. In other words, since sensation-knowledge we must\\nhave sensation that there is an absolute existence. But on\\nthis theory (that every feeling is relative) an absolute°sensa-tion\\nsensation is a contradiction in terms. We may give up the°sensa-tionalist\\nsensationalist hypothesis, and, admitting that we have knowledge\\nnot derived from feeling (viz., that an Absolute exists), hold\\nthat feeling is relative. Or we may give up the Relativity\\ntheory and hold, so far at least as this point is concerned,\\nthat Sensationalism is true. But to attempt to hold them\\ntogether is suicidal. If all our knowledge comes from°feel-ing\\nfeeling, since we can never have a feeling of the absolute object,\\nwe never can have knowledge of it; and we cannot have a\\nfeeling of it, since, by the theory, the Absolute is precisely\\nthat which is not conditioned by feeling. Or, on the other\\nhand, if we know that all feeling is relative, we do know that\\nthere is an absolute object, and hence have knowledge not\\nderived from sensation. When these alternatives are once\\nfairly faced, it will be seen that one or the other must be\\ndefinitely adopted. Both cannot be accepted. To attempt it is\\nto show that neither position is understood.\\nSuch is the fact. The reason for it is not far to seek. By\\nthe sensationalist hypothesis, we know only our feelings;\\naccording to the Relativity theory, we must know the°rela-tion\\nrelation of our feelings to an object; this the feelings cannot\\ngive, except by transcending their relativity—except, in\\nshort, by ceasing to be feelings. Hume showed once for all\\nthat if the sensationalist presuppositions be adopted, the\\n\\n ― 24 ―\\n                            \\n\"perceptions\" themselves were ultimate and final, and that\\nany supposed reference of them to an object is a fiction to be\\naccounted for as best may be.\\nAn examination of the method by which Mr. Spencer\\nattempts to unite with his sensationalism the position that\\nthe existence of an Absolute is known will confirm us in the\\nconclusions just drawn, for we shall see that the best which\\nhe can offer is a virtual surrender. His argument was°sub-stantially\\nsubstantially given in the passages cited from him, and is°simi-lar\\nsimilar to that given in the First Principles for the existence of\\nan absolute object in general. Briefly, it is as follows: \"The\\nexistence of a Non-relative is unavoidably asserted in every\\nchain of reasoning by which relativity is proved.\" This is\\napparently offered as a serious argument in proof of the\\nexistence of an absolute object; at least it is all that is\\noffered. Its worth may be made evident by a parallel°exam-ple\\nexample. To prove A, we must assume B; by its assumption A is\\nproved. But B is involved in the proof of A; therefore B is\\nalso proved. It is evident, or ought to be, that we have here\\nno proof of the existence of either A or B, of the Relative or\\nNon-relative, but simply that there can be no A without B,\\nno Relative without an Absolute—an undoubted fact, but\\none which leaves the existence of either in as much doubt as\\nbefore. In truth, it is not a solution of the difficulty, but a\\nstatement of it. It says that unless there be an absolute\\nobject, our feelings cannot be known as relative; while the\\nquestion is precisely how is this absolute object known. Mr.\\nSpencer\\'s legitimate conclusions from his argument are°ei-ther\\neither that there is no absolute object, and hence the feelings\\nare not relative, or we do know they are relative, and hence\\nknow that there is an absolute object, and have knowledge\\nwhich is not relative. To attempt, as he does, to prove the\\nexistence of one from the assumed existence of the other is to\\nreason in a circle. It cannot be that we know there is a\\nNon-relative because we know that our feelings are relative,\\nfor the latter point is just the one in question, and cannot be\\nproved, as Mr. Spencer himself shows, without assumption\\nof the former. The knowledge of the existence of the°Rela-tive\\nRelative cannot be made to depend upon the assumption of a\\nNon-relative, and knowledge of the existence of the°Non-rel-ative\\n ― 25 ―\\n                            \\nNon-relative upon that of the Relative, at one and the same time.\\nBut it is only by this most illogical procedure that Mr.\\nSpencer gets the Absolute, which, as he recognizes, is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to the proof of the Relativity hypothesis.\\nWe conclude, then, that we are justified in reasserting\\nour original statement. To know that our sensations are\\nrelative, we must know that there is an Absolute. To know\\nthat there is an Absolute is, on the sensationalist hypothesis,\\nto assert the contradictio in adjecto of an absolute feeling, or\\nelse to reason in the wholly illegitimate manner just°exam-ined\\nexamined. Hence, the two positions of Sensationalism and°Rela-tivity\\nRelativity of sensations are wholly irreconcilable.\\nSo far we have confined ourselves to the simplest°as-sumption\\nassumption of these theories as conjoined-the assumption that\\nthere is an absolute object or objects. We have not°con-cerned\\nconcerned ourselves with the question, What is this absolute\\nobject? This, however, can no longer be kept in the°back-ground\\nbackground. Even admitting what we have seen it impossible to\\nadmit on the hypothesis that we have knowledge of the\\nexistence of a Non-relative, we have yet to decide whether\\nthe relativity of feeling can be proved without knowing what\\nthis Non-relative is. The Sensationalist must hold, of course,\\nthat it can be. To hold that sensations can tell us what an\\nabsolute existence is, is a contradiction even greater (if\\nthere be degrees in contradiction) than the one we have just\\nseen the theory involved in. And so we find that the absolute\\nobject is for Mr. Spencer beyond consciousness, independent\\nof consciousness, unknowable. In fact, Absolute and°non-rel-ativeness\\nnon-relativeness to consciousness are synonymous terms with him\\nand the Sensationalists generally. Our question, therefore,\\nis: Can we prove the relativity of feelings on the hypothesis\\nthat they are relative to an unknown something by reference\\nof them to something out of and independent of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness?\\nIn reply, we ask the following questions: 1. Is it°possi-ble\\npossible to know that something is, if we have absolutely no\\nknowledge what that something is? Can we know that an\\nAbsolute is, if we don\\'t know what Absolute means? 2. Is it\\npossible to know the existence of anything which is ex\\nhypothesi out of relation to consciousness, and, further,\\n\\n ― 26 ―\\n                            \\nknow that this is the Absolute? 3. Is it possible to refer the\\nwhole content of consciousness to something which is°be-yond\\nbeyond consciousness? Since the Relative is so only as referred\\nto an Absolute, can such a ratio between that which is in\\nconsciousness and that which is out of it be discovered as to\\ndemonstrate the relative character of the former? All these\\nquestions must, I conceive, be answered in the negative. As\\nto the first, the predication of existence of an Unknowable\\nseems to be a psychological impossibility. If there be any\\nmeaning in the assertion that x is, I confess I cannot see it.\\nWhen it is said that something is, it is meant that something\\nis. The predication must be of something; it cannot be of a\\npure Non-entity, like the Unknowable. The subject must\\nmean something before it can be said either to be or not to\\nbe, or have any other intelligible proposition regarding it\\nmade. And so, as matter of fact, it is only as Mr. Spencer\\nidentifies his Unknowable with an Absolute, and thus takes\\nadvantage of the popular connotations of the word, that he is\\nable to say that the Unknowable is; it is only as he smuggles\\nsome degree of qualification, however slight, into the subject\\nthat he can make it the subject of a proposition.\\nThe question as to the possibility of knowledge of\\nanything beyond consciousness, while presenting, since°un-knowable\\nunknowable, the same difficulties to an affirmative answer as\\nthe question just considered, must, in addition, be answered\\nnegatively, on grounds of self-consistency. To say that°some-thing\\nsomething beyond consciousness is known to exist, is merely to\\nsay that the same thing is and is not in consciousness. Its\\nspecial characteristic is to be out of consciousness; but, so\\nfar as it is known to exist, it is in and for consciousness. To\\nsuppose otherwise is to suppose that consciousness can in\\nsome way get outside of or \"beyond\" itself, and be conscious\\nof that which is not in consciousness—a proposition as°ab-surd\\nabsurd as that a man can stand on his own shoulders, or\\noutstrip his shadow.\\nIf we go further and give to the Absolute any positive\\nsignification, if it becomes anything more than the blank\\nnegation of all determinate relations, the bare is, which\\nnevertheless is a qualification by thought, we are only°add-ing\\nadding further relations to consciousness; we are only°qualify-ing\\n ― 27 ―\\n                            \\nqualifying it further by thought relations. Can the theory we are\\nexamining avoid such determinations? This brings us to our\\nthird question: Can a mere x, an absolutely unrelated object,\\nafford us any ground for asserting the relativity of specific\\nobjects in consciousness as they actually exist? If the°abso-lute\\nabsolute object is entirely out of relation to consciousness, it\\ncertainly cannot be related to feelings, the supposed content\\nof consciousness. Even were it granted that we could know\\nthe existence of an unknowable object and know that it was\\nabsolute, we should not be justified in saying that our actual\\nfeelings were relative; to effect this, the Absolute must be\\nbrought into specific relations with specific feelings. As long\\nas its sole characteristic is unrelatedness to consciousness, it\\nand the content of consciousness have nothing to do with\\neach other; and to make one the ground of asserting°any-thing\\nanything regarding the real nature of the other is absurd.°In-deed\\nIndeed, not only must specific relations between the object and\\nfeelings be asserted, but we find as matter of fact at least one\\nsuch implicitly posited, viz., that of cause and effect. The\\nabsolute object is the cause, the feeling is the effect. Now,\\nremember that by this same theory all knowledge comes\\nfrom feeling, and then ask how is it possible for the feeling\\nconsciousness to know this relation. At most, Sensationalism\\ncan mean by causation regular succession of feelings; but\\nthe characteristics of the supposed cause in this case are\\nprecisely that it is not a feeling, and (since it is°unknow-able\\nunknowable) that the succession has never been once observed, but\\nit is only by making this self-destructive assumption that the\\ntheory can get the slightest footing.\\nWe conclude on this point, therefore, that, to prove the\\nRelativity of Feeling, it must be assumed that there is an\\nabsolute object; that this object must be in consciousness,\\nand specifically related to the content of consciousness, and\\nthat these relations cannot be in the way of feeling. We must\\nknow that there is such an object; we must know what it is,\\nand the what must consist in its relation to thought. Perhaps\\na method of stating this conclusion which would appear less\\nformal, though not less expressive of the difficulty, would be\\nto say that whatever is explained must be explained by\\nreference to the known and not the unknown. Even were it\\n\\n ― 28 ―\\n                            \\nadmitted, e.g., that the cause of our feelings and that force\\nhave some transcendental existence entirely unrelated to°our-selves\\nourselves and entirely unknown, it would not be by such°un-knowns\\nunknowns that the relative character of our present feelings\\ncould be shown. To show or to explain is to bring the thing\\ninto relation with something known. Explanation of the\\nunknown by the known, not of the known by the unknown,\\nis the order of science.\\nAn examination of the specific feelings which are said\\nto be relative to the subject will both bring this point into\\nclearer light, and reveal in what, positively, their relativity\\ndoes consist. In a concrete case: Why is the feeling of color\\nas given in immediate consciousness said to be relative? Is\\nthe knowledge that it is such obtained by reference to a\\nknown or an unknown object? The question thus put°an-swers\\nanswers itself. The sensation of color is said to be relative to\\nourselves because it is known to be dependent upon°vibra-tions\\nvibrations of ether and the retinal structure of the eye. It is\\nmerely the relation between these two as given in°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness. Unless I know that there is such a retinal structure and\\nsuch waves, or something corresponding to them, it is°ab-surd\\nabsurd to speak of the feeling of color as relative. It is only\\nbecause I may know what light is as objective that I may\\nknow that what it seems to be in feeling is relative and\\nsubjective. And so with sound and taste. The subjectivity of\\ntaste, e.g., means that in the object unrelated to a nervous\\norganism there is such and such a physical or chemical\\nstructure, and that the sensation of taste is the relation\\nbetween that structure and a corresponding organic°struc-ture\\nstructure. Clearly, then, our knowledge of subjectivity or°relativ-ity\\nrelativity depends upon knowledge of something objective. But it\\nmust be especially noticed that this something objective is\\nnot given in feeling, and, therefore, is not relative to sense.\\nThese objects-the waves of ether, the structure of the°ret-ina\\nretina, etc.-are not themselves feelings, and never have been:\\nwere they feelings, there would be no reason to assert the\\nrelative character of the feelings following upon them.°Con-sequently\\nConsequently, if it should be said that these so-called objects, the\\nvibrations, etc., although not themselves feelings, yet have\\nmeaning attached to them only in so far as they represent\\n\\n ― 29 ―\\n                            \\npossibilities of feeling-and mean only that under certain\\nconditions they would become feelings, and that even now\\nthey possess signification only as symbolized by actual°sen-sations\\nsensations—the answer is ready. But, before giving it, we will\\nstate the objection more fully. It may be said that the objects\\nwe have supposed, the vibrations, etc., are, as known,°them-selves\\nthemselves conditioned by the affection of the nervous organism\\nthrough some other object, and so on indefinitely, so that,\\nafter all, our knowledge of them is entirely relative.\\nBut any such objection, to be of value, must hold that\\nthis process goes on ad infinitum, as otherwise there would\\nbe something known not through feeling, and, therefore, not\\nrelative. But if it does go on ad infinitum, it is clear that we\\nfall into our original difficulty: nothing will ever be known\\nexcept the immediate feelings, and to refer them to anything\\nexisting out of or beyond themselves will be impossible. The\\nmere fact that one feeling is the antecedent of another could\\nnever give any reason for asserting that that feeling was\\nrelative in comparison with an unknown object. To suppose\\nthat it could, is to suppose that a feeling may transcend its\\nown relativity. Therefore, on this theory of the infinite°re-gress\\nregress, it can never be known that there is an absolute object,\\nand, therefore, immediately present feelings can never be\\nreferred to such an object; i.e., can never be known to be\\nrelative. They become themselves absolute and absolutely\\nknown.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that to prove the relativity of\\nfeeling is impossible without assuming that there are objects\\nwhich are known not through feeling. In short,°Sensational-ism\\nSensationalism and the Relativity hypothesis again prove themselves\\nutterly incompatible. The theory of the Relativity of°Feel-ing\\nFeeling, therefore, is so far from proving the subjectivity of our\\nknowledge that it is impossible, except upon a theory which\\nassumes that we do have objective knowledge.\\nThe removal of a possible misapprehension and an\\nobjection are needed to complete the discussion of this point.\\nIt will perhaps be said that, since the relativity of feeling\\nwas known long before there was knowledge of what the\\nobjects really were, and that since now it is possible or\\nprobable, in some cases, that we do not really know the\\n\\n ― 30 ―\\n                            \\nobjective order, our account cannot be correct. But it must\\nbe noticed that this account does not depend for its°correct-ness\\ncorrectness upon the question whether objects are really what we\\nthink they are, but simply upon the question whether the\\ntheory of the Relativity of Feeling does not assume and\\nrequire that it is possible to so know them. And this question\\nis implicitly answered in the affirmative in this very°objec-tion\\nobjection; for, if our present knowledge is incorrect, this can be\\nshown only by reference to an established objective order to\\nwhich, by greater knowledge, it shall be shown that our\\npresent theories do not correspond.\\nOr, again, it may be said our account is incorrect,\\nbecause the real reason for calling a feeling relative is not\\nbecause we have any knowledge of the object as referred to\\nwhich it is relative, but simply because under the same\\nobjective conditions different persons have different°sensa-tions\\nsensations, or even the same person at different times. But°noth-ing\\nnothing is gained by this change in expression, since it assumes\\nthat there are permanent objective conditions, which must\\nbe known. For the two differing feelings are either known to\\nrefer to the same object or they are not. If not, all ground for\\ncalling them relative disappears. But, if they are, of course\\nthis object must be known. By any method of stating the\\ntheory, it will be found impossible to avoid reference to a\\nknown order objectively existing. In this connection it may\\nnot be without interest to quote Mr. Spencer\\'s summary of\\nthe theory as admitting implicitly, though unconsciously,\\njust this point. He says: \"The quality and the quantity of\\nthe sensation produced by a given amount of a given°exter-nal\\nexternal force vary not only with the structure of the organism,\\nspecific and individual, as well as the structure of the part\\naffected, but also with the age, the constitutional state of the\\npart as modified by temperature, circulation, and previous\\nuse, and even with the relative motion of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject.\" What we desire to call attention to are the two°admis-sions\\nadmissions or claims which he makes, all unconscious of their\\nbearing upon his theory. (1) That there is objectively \"a\\ngiven amount of a given force\"; and (2) that some nine\\nobjectively existing causes of the modification of this force\\nas given in feeling can be shown. In short, it is assumed that\\n\\n ― 31 ―\\n                            \\nthere is an objective force, the kind and amount of which is\\nknown, and that the causes which produce the variations of\\nthis in immediate feeling can be shown, and, consequently,\\neliminated.\\nSo far, our conclusions as to the relation of the theory\\nof Relativity of Feeling to the theory of knowledge have\\nbeen negative, and consisted in pointing out that it was not\\nconsistent with Sensationalism. But we are now prepared to\\ndraw a positive conclusion and say that the real meaning of\\nthe theory of Relativity of Feeling is that a feeling is a\\nspecific determinate relation or reaction given in°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness between two bodies, one a sensitive, the other a non-\\nsensitive object. It is possible to hold it, therefore, only in\\nconjunction with a theory which allows knowledge of these\\nobjects; furthermore, since we have knowledge of these\\nobjective conditions, the knowledge of their relation as given\\nin feeling, though relative indeed to the subject, is not for\\nthat reason a detraction from our knowledge of objects, but\\nrather an addition. One certainly cannot see a priori any\\nreason why the knowledge of the reactions of, say gold, in\\nthe presence of an acid should be an interesting addition to\\nour knowledge of these substances, while the knowledge of\\nits relation to a sensitive organism as given in feeling should\\nbe a deprivation of real knowledge. Except upon the theory\\nthat the real nature of things is their nature out of relation to\\neverything, knowledge of the mode of relation between an\\nobject and an organism is just as much genuine knowledge\\nas knowledge of its physical and chemical properties, which\\nin turn are only its relations.\\nLeaving the subject of feelings, we come to that of\\nrelations between feelings which it has also been attempted\\nto demonstrate to be purely relative to the subject, giving no\\nknowledge of objective relations. There is no reason to draw\\nupon the patience of readers to examine this view. It is\\nsubject to all the difficulties which we have made out against\\nthe like theory regarding feelings, besides laboring under\\nthe additional difficulty of having to show that these°rela-tions\\nrelations are themselves naught but feelings. Since we have\\nalready shown that the relativity of feelings to the subject\\ncannot be proved without assuming objective relations, the\\n\\n ― 32 ―\\n                            \\ncase stands, a fortiori, against any such attempt as the\\npresent. There is also a self-contradiction in the theory so\\nglaring that it might well have made any one pause who was\\nnot so mastered by the presuppositions of his system as to be\\nblind to the rules of ordinary logic. Sensationalism must and\\ndoes hold that all relations are reducible to feelings; are\\nthemselves, indeed, but kinds of feeling. But the theory of\\nRelativity supposes a relation between the subjective feeling\\nand the unknown object which is the absolute. But,°accord-ing\\naccording to Sensationalism, this relation must be a feeling. Hence\\nnothing exists but feelings, and relativity is a myth! If there\\nbe no real relations, there can be no relativity; and,°con-versely\\nconversely, to say that feelings are really relative is to say that a\\nrelation really and objectively is, and is known. But to say\\nthis is to abandon the position that relation is a kind of\\nfeeling, and thereby to abandon Sensationalism. The fact\\nthat the two positions are so often held in conjunction is only\\nevidence of how slightly the real meaning of either is\\ngrasped.\\nWe summarize our results as follows: The doctrine of\\nthe Relativity of Feeling is incompatible with°Sensational-ism\\nSensationalism, and is so for two reasons. First, Sensationalism can\\nnever give knowledge of the sine qua non of the Relativity\\ntheory: the existence of an absolute object. For the very\\nreason that sensation is relative to the subject, it can never\\ntranscend that relativity and make assertions regarding\\nsomething absolute. Secondly, even if the existence of the\\nabsolute object were assured, feeling qua feeling can never\\ndemonstrate its own relativity. The Absolute here as an\\nunknown Universal can never be known to be the Absolute\\nwhich constitutes the relativity of the present content of\\nconsciousness. The feelings must be definitely referred to\\nthat absolute object. For feeling itself to make any such\\nreference assumes that it can transcend its relativity, and\\nknow not only an absolute object, but what it is and what\\nrelations subsist between the two.\\nBut if this knowledge of the existence of an absolute\\nobject and of its determinate relations is not given by°feel-ing\\nfeeling, we are justified in saying that it is given by a°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness which by its relations determines the object. For, as we\\n\\n ― 33 ―\\n                            \\nhave shown that these objects must be related to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, and cannot be related in the way of feeling, what they\\ncan be except as determined and constituted by relations of\\nthis consciousness it is not easy to see. Since a feeling can be\\nknown as relative only when referred to an object, this\\nobject cannot be a feeling, nor constituted by a feeling. The\\nobject must, then, be relative to a thinking consciousness.\\nThere are two points which every theory of the°Relativ-ity\\nRelativity of Feeling must include and explain: (a) In what does\\nthe relative character of the feelings consist? (b) What is\\nthe nature of the correlate absolute? The sensationalist°hy-pothesis\\nhypothesis breaks down, as we have seen, at both these points.\\nBut our present theory, that relativity consists in a specific\\nratio between a sensitive and a non-sensitive object, which\\nare constituted by relations to self-consciousness, proves°it-self\\nitself, I think, amply adequate. Since relativity, according to\\nit, consists not in relation to a nervous organism, but to\\nconsciousness, the possibility of knowledge is provided for.\\nAnd, on the other hand, since this self-consciousness is the\\nground and source of relations, it cannot be subject to them.\\nIt is itself the true Absolute, then. This does not mean that it\\nis the Unrelated, but that it is not conditioned by those\\nconditions which determine its objects. Thus, we are saved\\nthe absurdity of believing in a relative which has no°corre-late\\ncorrelate absolute.\\nWe have thus considered the theory of the Relativity of\\nKnowledge in that form where it unites itself with and bases\\nitself upon feeling. The reader may see for himself how\\nlarge a portion of it would also apply to any theory of the\\nRelativity of Knowledge. In closing, we must repeat the\\ncaution with which we began: that we are not dealing with\\nthe theory of Relativity of Feeling as a psychological theory.\\nThe correctness of the theory is undoubted. The°philosophi-cal\\nphilosophical interpretation of it is the point in question. Its conditions\\nand implications need development, and we have attempted\\nto show that when they are developed the theory is°compati-ble\\ncompatible neither with Sensationalism, nor with Subjectivism, nor\\nwith Agnosticism; that it is compatible only with a theory\\nwhich admits the constitutive power of Thought, as itself\\nultimate Being, determining objects.\\n\\n ― 34 ―\\n                            \\nKant and Philosophic Method [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVIII\\n(April 1884), 162-74. Not reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nOn its subjective side, so far as individuals are concerned,\\nphilosophy comes into existence when men are confronted\\nwith problems and contradictions which common sense and\\nthe special sciences are able neither to solve nor resolve.\\nThere is felt the need of going deeper into things, of not\\nbeing content with hap-hazard views or opinions derived\\nfrom this or that science, but of having some principle\\nwhich, true on its account, may also serve to judge the truth\\nof all besides. It is no matter of accident that modern°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy begins, in Descartes, with a method which doubts all,\\nthat it may find that wherewith to judge all; nor is it°mean-ingless\\nmeaningless that Kant, the founder of modernist philosophy,\\ncommences his first great work with a similar demand, and\\n\"calls upon Reason to undertake the most difficult of tasks,\\nself-knowledge, and establish a tribunal to decide all°ques-tions\\nquestions according to its own eternal and unchangeable laws.\" See Kant\\'s Werke, Rosenkranz\\'s ed., vol. ii, p. 7.\\n»1\\nThis self-knowledge of Reason, then, is the Method and\\ncriterion which Kant offers.\\nBefore we may see what is involved in this, it is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to see what in gist the previous methods had been, and\\nwhy they had failed. The method of \"intellectualism\" begun\\nby Descartes and presented to Kant through Wolff was (in\\none word): Analysis of conceptions, with the law of identity\\nor non-contradiction for criterion. To discover truth is to\\nanalyze the problem down to those simple elements which\\ncannot be thought away, and reach a judgment whose°predi-cate\\npredicate may be clearly and distinctly seen to be identical with\\nits subject. Analytic thought, proceeding by the law of\\n\\n ― 35 ―\\n                            \\nidentity, gives the method for philosophic procedure. Now,\\nKant in his pre-critical period See especially his essay on attempt to introduce the idea ofnega-tive\\nnegative quantity into philosophy. Werke, vol. i.\\n»2 had become convinced that\\nanalysis does not explain such a conception as that which we\\nhave of causation: \"How one thing should arise out of\\nanother, when it is not connected with it, according to the\\nlaw of identity, this is a thing which I should much like to\\nhave explained.\" Werke, vol. i, p. 157.\\n»3 Nor again, while it may be, and°undoubt-edly\\nundoubtedly is, the method for pure thought, does it give any means\\nfor passing from thought to existence. This, he would say, is\\nno predicate of anything; it is part of no conception, and can\\nbe got by no analysis. Reality is added to our notions from\\nwithout, not evolved from them. But, if logical thought is\\nnot adequate to such notions as cause, nor able to reach\\nexistence, it can be no method for discovering Absolute\\nTruth.\\nSo Kant finds himself thrown into the arms of the\\nEmpiricists. It is experience which shows us the origin of an\\neffect in a cause, and experience which adds reality or°exist-ence\\nexistence to our thoughts. What, then, is the method of°\"Empiri-cism\\n\"Empiricism\"? Beginning with Bacon, at first it merely asserted that\\nthe mind must be freed from all subjective elements, and\\nbecome a mirror, to reflect the world of reality. But this, as\\ncriterion, is purely negative, and required the positive°com-plement\\ncomplement of Locke. This method in a word is, Analysis of\\nperceptions with agreement as criterion. In contrast with the\\nintellectual school, which began with conceptions supposed\\nto be found ready-made in the human mind, it begins with\\nthe perceptions impressed upon that blank tablet, the Mind,\\nby external objects, and finds \"knowledge to consist in the\\nperception of the connection or agreement or disagreement\\nof these ideas.\" But two questions arise: If truth or°knowl-edge\\nknowledge consists in perceptions, how, any more than from°con-ceptions\\nconceptions, shall we get to an external world? This question\\nwas answered by Berkeley in showing that, if knowledge\\nwere what this theory made it to be, the external world was\\njust that whose esse is percipi. The second question is:\\nWhat is agreement of perception? Agreement certainly\\n\\n ― 36 ―\\n                            \\nmeans, as Locke said, \"connexion,\" that is, mutual°refer-ence\\nreference, or synthesis. But how can this synthesis occur? The\\nmind is a blank, a wax tablet, a tabula rasa, whose sole\\nnature is receptivity, and certainly it can furnish no°syn-thesis\\nsynthesis. Locke had avoided the difficulty by assuming that\\nideas come to us or are \"given\" more or less conjoined—that\\none has naturally some bond of union with another. But this,\\nof course, cannot be. Simple impressions or perceptions are,\\nas Hume stated, such as admit of no distinction or°separa-tion\\nseparation, and these are the ultimate sensations. These have no\\nconnection with each other, except perhaps the accidental\\none of following or occurring together in time, and so it is\\nthat \"every distinct perception is a separate existence.\"°Nec-essary\\nNecessary connection among them, therefore, there can be none.\\nSensations are purely contingent, accidental, and external in\\ntheir relations to each other, with no bonds of union. Any\\nagreement is the result of chance or blind custom.°Knowl-edge\\nKnowledge as the necessary connection of perceptions does not\\nexist.\\nKant consequently discovers, by a more thorough\\nstudy of empiricism, that it too betrays him. It, no more than\\nhis former guides, can furnish him with a way of getting to\\nan external world nor to knowledge at all. Nay, even self,\\nsome ghost of which was left him by the other method, has\\ndisappeared too.\\nWhat has been the difficulty? Descartes did not come\\nto a stand-still at once, for he had tacitly presupposed the\\nsynthetic power of thought in itself—had even laid the\\nground for a theory of it in his reference to the Ego, or\\nself-consciousness. But his successors, neglecting this, and\\ndeveloping only the analytic aspect of thought, had°pro-duced\\nproduced a vacuum, where no step to existence or actual°rela-tions\\nrelations, being synthetic, could be taken. \"Conceptions are\\nempty.\" Nor had Locke been estopped immediately, for he\\npresupposed some synthesis in the objective world; but it\\nturns out that he had no right to it, and world, self, and all\\nactual relations, being synthetic, have gone. \"Perceptions\\nare blind.\" The problem, then, is clearly before Kant, as is\\nthe key to its solution. Synthesis is the sine qua non.°Knowl-edge\\nKnowledge is synthesis, and the explanation of knowledge or truth\\n\\n ― 37 ―\\n                            \\nmust be found in the explanation of synthesis. Hence the\\nquestion of Method is now the question: How are synthetic\\njudgments a priori possible? A priori means simply°belong-ing\\nbelonging to Reason in its own nature, so the question is, How and\\nto what extent is Reason the source of synthesis?\\nThe case stands thus: Pure thought is purely analytic;\\nexperience per se gives only a blind rhapsody of particulars,\\nwithout meaning or connection—actual experience, or\\nknowledge involves, is synthesis. How shall it be got? One\\npath remains open. We may suppose that while thought in\\nitself is analytic, it is synthetic when applied to a material\\ngiven it, and that from this material, by its functions, it\\nforms the objects which it knows. And such, in its lowest\\nterms, is the contribution Kant makes. The material, the\\nmanifold, the particulars, are furnished by Sense in°percep-tion\\nperception; the conceptions, the synthetic functions from Reason\\nitself, and the union of these two elements are required, as\\nwell for the formation of the object known, as for its°know-ing\\nknowing.\\nTo characterize Kant\\'s contribution to Method, it°re-mains\\nremains to briefly examine these two sides of his theory: First,\\nfor the part played by the synthetic functions or the°catego-ries\\ncategories. These, in first intention, are so many conceptions of the\\nunderstanding, and, as such, subject to analysis according to\\nthe law of identity, and thus furnish the subject-matter of\\nLogic. But they also have relation to objects, and, as such,\\nare synthetic and furnish the subject-matter of°Transcen-dental\\nTranscendental Logic, whose work is to demonstrate and explain their\\nobjective validity. This is done by showing that \"the°catego-ries\\ncategories make experience and its objects for the first time°possi-ble\\npossible.\" That is to say, Kant, after showing that the principles\\nof identity and contradiction, though the highest criteria of\\nlogical thought, can give no aid in determining the truths of\\nactual experience, inquires what is the criterion of truth for\\nthe latter, or what comes to the same thing, of the synthetic\\nuse of the categories as Transcendental Logic—and the°an-swer\\nanswer he finds to be \"possible experience\" itself. In other\\nwords, the categories have objective validity or synthetic use\\nbecause without them no experience would be possible. If\\nHume, for example, asks how we can have assurance that\\n\\n ― 38 ―\\n                            \\nthe notion of causality has any worth when applied to°ob-jects\\nobjects, he is answered by showing that without this notion\\nexperience as an intelligible connected system would not\\nexist. By the categories the objects of experience are°consti-tuted\\nconstituted, and hence their objective validity.\\nIt follows, accordingly, that the system of experience\\nmay be determined, as to its form, by a completely made out\\nsystem of categories. In them, as synthetic functions,°consti-tuting\\nconstituting experience, we find the criterion of truth. But they\\nthemselves have a higher condition. As synthetic functions,\\nthey must all be functions of a higher unity which is subject\\nto none of them. And this Kant calls the synthetic unity of\\nApperception or, in brief, self-consciousness. This is the\\nhighest condition of experience, and in the developed notion\\nof self-consciousness we find the criterion of truth. The\\ntheory of self-consciousness is Method.\\nBut this abstract statement must be farther developed.\\nIt comes to saying, on the one hand, that the criterion of the\\ncategories is possible experience, and on the other, that the\\ncriterion of possible experience is the categories and their\\nsupreme condition. This is evidently a circle, yet a circle\\nwhich, Kant would say, exists in the case itself, which\\nexpresses the very nature of knowledge. It but states that in\\nknowledge there is naught but knowledge which knows or is\\nknown—the only judge of knowledge, of experience, is°expe-rience\\nexperience itself. And experience is a system, a real whole made\\nup of real parts. It as a whole is necessarily implied in every\\nfact of experience, while it is constituted in and through\\nthese facts. In other terms, the relation of categories to°ex-perience\\nexperience is the relation of members of an organism to a\\nwhole. The criterion of knowledge is neither anything°out-side\\noutside of knowledge, nor a particular conception within the\\nsphere of knowledge which is not subject to the system as a\\nwhole; it is just this system which is constituted, so far as its\\nform is concerned, by the categories.\\nPhilosophic Method, or the discovering of the criterion\\nof truth, will consist, then, in no setting up of a transcendent\\nobject as the Empiricists did, or of an abstract principle\\nafter the manner of the intellectual school. Since the°catego-ries\\ncategories, in and through self-consciousness, constitute°experi-ence\\n ― 39 ―\\n                            \\nexperience, Method will consist in making out a complete table of\\nthese categories in all their mutual relations, giving each its\\nproper placing, with the full confidence that when so placed\\neach will have its proper place in experience, i.e., its°capac-ity\\ncapacity for expressing reality determined.\\nBut we have now strayed far from Kant. While having\\nsaid nothing which is not deducible from his Transcendental\\nLogic, we have abstracted from the fact that this holds only\\nof the form of our knowledge; that there is also an æsthetic,\\nand that thought is synthetic, not in itself, but only upon a\\nmaterial supplied to it from without. Turning to this, we\\nfind the aspect of affairs changed. Though the categories\\nmake experience, they make it out of a foreign material to\\nwhich they bear a purely external relation. They constitute\\nobjects, but these objects are not such in universal reference,\\nbut only to beings of like capacities of receptivity as°our-selves\\nourselves. They respect not existence in itself, but ourselves as\\naffected by that existence. The system of categories°fur-nishes\\nfurnishes the criterion for all the knowledge we have, but this\\nturns out to be no real knowledge. It is, Hegel says, as if one\\nascribed correct insight to a person, and then added that he\\ncould see only into the untruth, not the truth. Nor does the\\ndeficiency of our method end here. We had previously°as-sumed\\nassumed that the categories as a system, or in their organic\\nrelation to self-consciousness, could be known. But it now\\nturns out that nothing can be known except that to which\\nthis feeling of external matter through sensibility is given.\\nTo know this subject, or self-consciousness, is to make an\\nobject of it, and every object is sensible, that is, has a feeling\\nwhich tells us how we are affected. But such a knowledge is\\nevidently no knowledge of self-consciousness in its own°na-ture\\nnature. Thus, so far as knowledge is concerned, it must remain\\na bare form of self-identity, of \"I=I,\" into definite organic\\nrelations with which the categories can never be brought.\\nHence, it appears that our picture of a method was doubly\\nfalse—false in that after all it could not reach truth; false in\\nthat after all no such method was in itself possible. Our\\norganic system of categories cannot constitute absolute truth\\n—and no such organic system is itself knowable. Criterion\\nand method we are still without. The golden prize, which\\n\\n ― 40 ―\\n                            \\nseemed just within our hands as long as we confined°our-selves\\nourselves to the Transcendental Logic, turns out to be a tinsel\\nsuperfluity.\\nYet, none the less, there was the suggestion of a\\nmethod there, which is exactly what we wish. The only\\nquestion is: Is its reference to the Æsthetic necessary? Is the\\nlatter a necessary part of Kant\\'s theory, or, so far as it\\nconcerns the reception of external matter, an excrescence?\\nThe question is just here: Previous methods failed because\\nthey made no allowance for synthesis—Kant\\'s because the\\nsynthesis can occur only upon matter foreign to it. Thought\\nin the previous theories was purely analytic; in Kant\\'s it is\\npurely synthetic, in that it is synthesis of foreign material.\\nWere thought at once synthetic and analytic, differentiating\\nand integrating in its own nature, both affirmative and°nega-tive\\nnegative, relating to self at the same time that it related to other\\n—indeed, through this relation to other-the difficulty would\\nnot have arisen.\\nIs the state of the case as Kant supposes? Must we say\\nthat Reason is synthetic only upon condition that material be\\ngiven it to act upon, or, may it be, that while we must say\\nthat for the individual the material, nay, the form as°indissol-ubly\\nindissolubly connected with the material, is given, yet, to Reason\\nitself, nothing is given in the sense of being foreign to it?\\nA slight examination will show us that, at least as far\\nas Kant is concerned, the former supposition is but an°arbi-trary\\narbitrary limitation or assumption, which Kant imposed upon\\nhimself, or received without question from previous°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy. On one side, he had learned that pure thought is\\nanalytic; on the other, that the individual is affected with\\nsensations impressed upon it by external objects. At the\\nsame time that he corrects both of these doctrines with his\\nown deduction of the categories, he formally retains both\\nerrors.\\nSo we have him asking at the very outset, as a matter\\nof course: \"In what other way is it to be conceived that the\\nknowing power can be excited to activity, except by objects\\nwhich affect our senses?\" That is to say, he assumes at the\\noutset that there is something external to Reason by which it\\nmust be excited. He perceives, what all admit, that an°indi-vidual\\n ― 41 ―\\n                            \\nindividual organized in a certain specific way with certain°sen-ses\\nsenses, and external things acting upon these senses, are°condi-tions\\nconditions to our knowledge, and then proceeds to identify°respec-tively\\nrespectively this individual with the subject, and these things with\\nthe object, in the process of knowledge. But here it is that\\nwe ask with what right does he make this identification. If it\\nis made, then surely the case stands with Reason as he says\\nit does—it acts only upon a material foreign to it. Yet this\\nindividual and these things are but known objects already\\nconstituted by the categories, and existing only for the°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic unity of apperception or self-consciousness. This,\\nthen, is the real subject, and the so-called subject and object\\nare but the forms in which it expresses its own activity. In\\nshort, the relation of subject and object is not a°\"transcend-ent\\n\"transcendent\" one, but an \"immanent,\" and is but the first form in\\nwhich Reason manifests that it is both synthetic and°ana-lytic\\nanalytic; that it separates itself from itself, that it may thereby\\nreach higher unity with itself. It is the highest type of the\\nlaw which Reason follows everywhere. The material which\\nwas supposed to confront Reason as foreign to it is but the\\nmanifestation of Reason itself. Such, at least, are the results\\nwhich we reach in the Transcendental Deduction, and such\\nare the results we consider ourselves justified to keep in\\nopposition to Kant\\'s pure assumptions.\\nWe see the same thing in Kant\\'s theory of°phenome-non\\nphenomenon. Just as, concerning the process of knowledge, he°as-sumes\\nassumes that subject and object are in external relation to each\\nother, and hence Reason in contact with a foreign material,\\nso here he assumes that the character of phenomenality\\nconsists in relation to an unknowable noumenon. The°phe-nomenon\\nphenomenon is referred to something outside of experience,°in-stead\\ninstead of being defined by its relation within experience—in\\nwhich case it would be seen to be a phenomenon in its own\\nnature, in that the categories which constitute it as such are\\nnot adequate to truth.\\nWe have but to turn to Kant\\'s derivation of the°catego-ries\\ncategories, to be again assured that Kant\\'s theory of Reason as\\nsynthetic only in reference to foreign material is one purely\\nassumed. As is notorious, these he took from the Logic of\\nthe School, which he held to give a complete table of all the\\n\\n ― 42 ―\\n                            \\nforms of pure thought. When we turn to this table we find\\nthe highest point reached in it to be reciprocity. Now,°reci-procity\\nreciprocity is precisely that external relation of two things to\\neach other that we have already found existing, in Kant\\'s\\ntheory, between subject and object in Knowledge—the°rela-tions\\nrelations of things that are independent of each other but°mu-tually\\nmutually act upon each other. So, too, it is but another way of\\nstating that Thought, analytic in itself, is synthetic when\\napplied to an external material, or that this material, blind\\nand hap-hazard in itself, is formed by something acting\\nupon it. When Kant tells us, therefore, that the categories\\nare not limited in their own nature, but become so when\\napplied, as they must be, to determine space and time, we\\nhave in our hands the means of correcting him. They are\\nlimited, and express just the limitation of Kant himself. And\\nKant confesses their insufficiency as soon as he takes up the\\nquestions of moral and æsthetic experience and of life itself.\\nHere we find the categories of freedom determined by ends,\\nfree production, organism to be everywhere present, while\\nall through his Critiques is woven in the notion of an°intui-tive\\nintuitive understanding which is the ultimate criterion of all\\ntruth, and this understanding is just what we have already\\nmet as the organic system of experience or°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness.\\nWhether we consider the relations of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, or the nature of the categories, we find ourselves forced\\ninto the presence of the notion of organic relation. The\\nrelation between subject and object is not an external one; it\\nis one in a higher unity which is itself constituted by this\\nrelation. The only conception adequate to experience as a\\nwhole is organism. What is involved in the notion of°organ-ism\\norganism? Why, precisely the Idea which we had formerly\\nreached of a Reason which is both analytic and synthetic, a\\nReason which differentiates itself that it may integrate itself\\ninto fuller riches, a Reason that denies itself that it may\\nbecome itself. Such a Reason, and neither an analytic\\nThought, nor an analytic Experience, nor a Reason which is\\nanalytic in itself, and synthetic for something else, is the\\nultimate criterion of truth, and the theory of this Reason is\\nthe Philosophic Method.\\n\\n ― 43 ―\\n                            \\nThe two defects which we found before in Kant\\'s theory\\nnow vanish. The method is no longer one which can reach\\nuntruth only, nor is it a method which cannot be made out.\\nThe track which we were upon in following the course of\\nthe Transcendental Deduction was the right one. The°crite-rion\\ncriterion of experience is the system of categories in their organic\\nunity in self-consciousness, and the method consists in°deter-mining\\ndetermining this system and the part each plays in constituting it.\\nThe method takes the totality of experience to pieces, and\\nbrings before us its conditions in their entirety. The°rela-tions\\nrelations of its content, through which alone this content has\\ncharacter and meaning, whereby it becomes an intelligible,\\nconnected whole, must be made to appear.\\nIt was the suggestion of this method, it was the\\nsuggestion of so many means for its execution, it was the\\nactual carrying of it out in so many points that makes Kant\\'s\\n\"Philosophy\" the critical philosophy, and his work the°cri-sis\\ncrisis, the separating, dividing, turning-point of modern°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy, and this hurried sketch would not be complete if we\\ndid not briefly point out what steps have been taken toward\\nthe fulfilling of the Ideal. This is found chiefly in Hegel and\\nhis \"Logic.\" We can only discuss in the light of what has\\nalready been said why Hegel begins with Logic; why the\\nnegative plays so important a part in his philosophy, and\\nwhat is the meaning of Dialectic.\\n\\n1. LOGIC. One of Hegel\\'s repeated charges against Kant is\\nthat he examines the categories with reference to their°objec-tive\\nobjective character, and not to determine their own meaning and\\nworth. At first it might seem as if this were the best way to\\ndetermine their worth, but it ought now to be evident that\\nsuch a procedure is both to presuppose that they are°subjec-tive\\nsubjective in themselves, and that we have a ready-made°concep-tion\\nconception of object by which to judge them—in short, it amounts\\nto saying that these conceptions are purely analytic, and\\nhave meaning only in relation to an external material. Hence\\nthe method must examine the categories without any°refer-ence\\nreference to subjective or objective existences; or, to speak°prop-erly\\nproperly, since we now see that there are no purely subjective\\nor objective existences, without any relation to things and\\n\\n ― 44 ―\\n                            \\nthoughts as two distinct spheres. The antithesis between\\nthem is not to be blinked out of sight, but it must be treated\\nas one which exists within Reason, and not one with one\\nterm in and the other out. The categories which, for the\\nindividual, determine the nature of the object, and those\\nwhich state how the object is brought into the subjective\\nform of cognition, must be deduced from Reason alone. A\\ntheory performing this task is what Hegel calls Logic, and is\\nneeded not only to overcome Kant\\'s defects, but is°immedi-ately\\nimmediately suggested by his positive accomplishments. In our\\naccount of the Transcendental Deduction we saw that self-\\nconsciousness was the supreme condition of all the°catego-ries\\ncategories, and hence can be subject in itself to none of them.\\nWhen it is made subject we have no longer the absolute\\nself-consciousness, but the empirical ego, the object of the\\ninner sense. In short, the categories constitute the°individu-als\\nindividuals as an object of experience, just as much as they do the\\nmaterial known. Hence they are no more subjective than\\nobjective. We may call them indifferently neither or both.\\nThe truth is, they belong to a sphere where the antithesis\\nbetween subject and object is still potential, or an sich. It is\\nevident, therefore, that logic, in the Hegelian use, is just\\nthat criterion of truth which we thought at first to find in\\nKant\\'s Transcendental Logic—it is an account of the°concep-tions\\nconceptions or categories of Reason which constitute experience,\\ninternal and external, subjective and objective, and an°ac-count\\naccount of them as a system, an organic unity in which each\\nhas its own place fixed. It is the completed Method of\\nPhilosophy.\\n\\n2. THE NEGATIVE IN HEGEL. It ought now to be evident\\nthat any philosophy which can pretend to be a method of\\ntruth must show Reason as both analytic and synthetic. If\\nHistory can demonstrate anything, it has demonstrated this,\\nboth by its successes and its failures. Reason must be that\\nwhich separates itself, which differentiates, goes forth into\\ndifferences, that it may then grasp these differences into a\\nunity of its own. It cannot unite unless there be difference;\\nthere can be no synthesis where there is not analysis. On the\\nother hand, the differences must remain forever foreign to\\n\\n ― 45 ―\\n                            \\nReason unless it brings them together; there can be no\\nanalysis where there is not synthesis, or a unity to be°di-rempted\\ndirempted. If there be no synthesis in Reason, we end in the\\nimpotence of the former school of intellectualism, or in the\\nhelpless scepticism of Hume; if Reason be synthetic only\\nupon a foreign material, we end in the contradictions of\\nKant. If there is to be knowledge, Reason must include both\\nelements within herself. It is Hegel\\'s thorough recognition\\nof this fact that causes him to lay such emphasis on the\\nnegative. Pure affirmation or identity reaches its summit in\\nSpinoza, where all is lost in the infinite substance of infinite\\nattributes, as waves in the sea. Yet even Spinoza was obliged\\nto introduce the negative, the determinations, the modes,\\nthough he never could succeed in getting them by any\\nmeans from his pure affirmation. In Hume we find pure\\ndifference or negation, the manifold particularization of°sen-sations\\nsensations, but even he is obliged to introduce synthetic°princi-ples\\nprinciples in the laws of association, though he never succeeds in\\nlegitimately deriving them from sensations, for a \"consistent\\nsensationalism is speechless.\" Kant had tried a compromise\\nof the principle, synthesis from within, difference from°with-out\\nwithout. That, too, failed to give us knowledge or a criterion of\\nTruth. Hegel comprehends the problem, and offers us°Rea-son\\nReason affirmative and negative, and affirmative only in and\\nthrough its own negations, as the solution.\\n\\n3. DIALECTIC. We have now the notion of Dialectic before\\nus in its essential features. We have seen that the desired\\nobject is a theory of the Conceptions of Reason in an organic\\nsystem, and that Reason is itself both integrating and°differ-entiating\\ndifferentiating. Dialectic is the construction by Reason, through\\nits successive differentiations and resumptions of these°dif-ferences\\ndifferences into higher unities, of just this system. If we take\\nany single category of Reason—that is to say, some°concep-tion\\nconception which we find involved in the system of experience—this\\nis one specific form into which Reason has unified or°\"syn-thesized\\n\"synthesized\" itself. Reason itself is immanent in this category;\\nbut, since Reason is also differentiating or analytic, Reason\\nmust reveal itself as such in this category, which°accord-ingly\\naccordingly passes, or is reflected, or develops into its opposite,\\n\\n ― 46 ―\\n                            \\nwhile the two conceptions are then resumed into the higher\\nunity of a more concrete conception.\\nSince the system of knowledge is implicit in each of its\\nmembers, each category must judge itself, or rather,°Rea-son\\nReason, in its successive forms, passes judgment on its own\\ninadequacy until the adequate is reached—and this can be\\nnothing but Reason no longer implicit, but developed into its\\ncompleted system. Reason must everywhere, and in all its\\nforms, propose itself as what it is, viz., absolute or adequate\\nto the entire truth of experience; but, since at first its form is\\nstill inadequate, it must show what is absolutely implicit in\\nit, viz., the entire system. That at first it does, by doing what\\nit is the nature of the Reason which it manifests to do, by\\ndifferencing itself, or passing into its opposite, its other; but,\\nsince Reason is also synthetic, grasping together, these°dif-ferences\\ndifferences must resolve themselves into a higher unity. Thus,\\nReason continues until it has developed itself into the°con-ception\\nconception which is in form equal to what itself is in content, or,\\nuntil it has manifested all that it is implicitly. A twofold\\nprocess has occurred. On the one hand, each special form of\\nReason or Category has been placed; that is, its degree of\\nability to state absolute truth fixed by its place in the whole\\norganic system. On the other, the system itself has been\\ndeveloped; that is to say, as Reason goes on manifesting its\\nown nature through successive differences and unities, each\\nlower category is not destroyed, but retained-but retained\\nat its proper value. Each, since it is Reason, has its relative\\ntruth; but each, since Reason is not yet adequately°mani-fested\\nmanifested, has only a relative truth. The Idea is the completed\\ncategory, and this has for its meaning or content Reason\\nmade explicit or manifested; that is, all the stages or types of\\nReason employed in reaching it. \"The categories are not\\nerrors, which one goes through on the way to the truth, but\\nphases of truth. Their completed system in its organic\\nwholeness is the Truth.\" And such a system is at once\\nphilosophic Method and Criterion; method, because it shows\\nus not only the way to reach truth, but truth itself in°con-struction\\nconstruction; criterion, because it gives us the form of°experi-ence\\nexperience to which all the facts of experience as organic members\\nmust conform.\\n\\n ― 47 ―\\n                            \\nIt will be seen, I hope, that we have not left our\\nsubject, \"Kant\\'s Relation to Philosophic Method\"; for a\\ncrisis is nothing in itself. It is a crisis only as it is the\\nturning-point; and a turning-point is the old passing into the\\nnew, and can be understood only as the old and the new are\\nunderstood. The criterion of Kant is just this turning-point;\\nit is the transition of the old abstract thought, the old°mean-ingless\\nmeaningless conception of experience, into the new concrete\\nthought, the ever growing, ever rich experience.\\n\\n ― 48 ―\\n                            \\nThe New Psychology [First published in the Andover Review, II (Sept. 1884), 278-89.\\nNot reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nBacon\\'s dictum regarding the proneness of the mind, in\\nexplanation, towards unity and simplicity, at no matter what\\nsacrifice of material, has found no more striking°exemplifi-cation\\nexemplification than that offered in the fortunes of psychology. The\\nleast developed of the sciences, for a hundred years it has\\nborne in its presentations the air of the one most completely\\nfinished. The infinite detail and complexity of the simplest\\npsychical life, its interweavings with the physical organism,\\nwith the life of others in the social organism,—created no\\nspecial difficulty; and in a book like James Mill\\'s Analysis\\nwe find every mental phenomenon not only explained, but\\nexplained by reference to one principle. That rich and°col-ored\\ncolored experience, never the same in two nations, in two\\nindividuals, in two moments of the same life,—whose\\nthoughts, desires, fears, and hopes have furnished the°mate-rial\\nmaterial for the ever-developing literature of the ages, for a\\nHomer and a Chaucer, a Sophocles and a Shakespeare, for\\nthe unwritten tragedies and comedies of daily life,—was\\nneatly and carefully dissected, its parts labeled and stowed\\naway in their proper pigeon-holes, the inventory taken, and\\nthe whole stamped with the stamp of un fait accompli.\\nSchematism was supreme, and the air of finality was over\\nall.\\nWe know better now. We know that that life of man\\nwhose unfolding furnishes psychology its material is the\\nmost difficult and complicated subject which man can°inves-tigate\\ninvestigate. We have some consciousness of its ramifications and\\nof its connections. We see that man is somewhat more than\\na neatly dovetailed psychical machine who may be taken as\\nan isolated individual, laid on the dissecting table of analysis\\n\\n ― 49 ―\\n                            \\nand duly anatomized. We know that his life is bound up\\nwith the life of society, of the nation in the ethos and nomos;\\nwe know that he is closely connected with all the past by the\\nlines of education, tradition, and heredity; we know that\\nman is indeed the microcosm who has gathered into himself\\nthe riches of the world, both of space and of time, the world\\nphysical and the world psychical. We know also of the\\ncomplexities of the individual life. We know that our mental\\nlife is not a syllogistic sorites, but an enthymeme most of\\nwhose members are suppressed; that large tracts never come\\ninto consciousness; that those which do get into°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, are vague and transitory, with a meaning hard to catch\\nand read; are infinitely complex, involving traces of the\\nentire life history of the individual, or are vicarious, having\\nsignificance only in that for which they stand; that psychical\\nlife is a continuance, having no breaks into \"distinct ideas\\nwhich are separate existences\"; that analysis is but a process\\nof abstraction, leaving us with a parcel of parts from which\\nthe \"geistige Band\" is absent; that our distinctions, however\\nnecessary, are unreal and largely arbitrary; that mind is no\\ncompartment box nor bureau of departmental powers; in\\nshort, that we know almost nothing about the actual°activi-ties\\nactivities and processes of the soul. We know that the old°psychol-ogy\\npsychology gave descriptions of that which has for the most part no\\nexistence, and which at the best it but described and did not\\nexplain.\\nI do not say this to depreciate the work of the earlier\\npsychologists. There is no need to cast stones at those who,\\nhaving a work to do, did that work well and departed. With\\nSir William Hamilton and J. Stuart Mill the school passed\\naway. It is true that many psychologists still use their°lan-guage\\nlanguage and follow their respective fashions. Their influence,\\nno doubt, is yet everywhere felt. But changed conditions are\\nupon us, and thought, no more than revolution, goes°back-ward\\nbackward. Psychology can live no better in the past than°physiol-ogy\\nphysiology or physics; but there is no more need for us to revile\\nHume and Reid for not giving birth to a full and complete\\nscience, than there is for complaining that Newton did not\\nanticipate the physical knowledge of to-day, or Harvey the\\nphysiological.\\n\\n ― 50 ―\\n                            \\nThe work of the earlier psychologists bore a definite\\nand necessary relation both to the scientific conditions and\\nthe times in which it was done. If they had recognized the\\ncomplexity of the subject and attempted to deal with it, the\\nscience would never have been begun. The very condition of\\nits existence was the neglect of the largest part of the°mate-rial\\nmaterial, the seizing of a few schematic ideas and principles, and\\ntheir use for universal explanation. Very mechanical and\\nvery abstract to us, no doubt, seems their division of the\\nmind into faculties, the classification of mental phenomena\\ninto the regular, graded, clear-cut series of sensation, image,\\nconcept, etc.; but let one take a look into the actual processes\\nof his own mind, the actual course of the mental life there\\nrevealed, and he will realize how utterly impossible were the\\ndescription, much more the explanation, of what goes on\\nthere, unless the larger part of it were utterly neglected, and\\na few broad schematic rubrics seized by which to reduce this\\nswimming chaos to some semblance of order.\\nAgain, the history of all science demonstrates that\\nmuch of its progress consists in bringing to light problems.\\nLack of consciousness of problems, even more than lack of\\nability to solve them, is the characteristic of the°non-scien-tific\\nnon-scientific mind. Problems cannot be solved till they are seen and\\nstated, and the work of the earlier psychologists consisted\\nlargely in this sort of work. Further, they were filled with\\nthe Zeitgeist of their age, the age of the eighteenth century\\nand the Aufklärung, which found nothing difficult, which\\nhated mystery and complexity, which believed with all its\\nheart in principles, the simpler and more abstract the better,\\nand which had the passion of completion. By this spirit, the\\npsychologists as well as the other thinkers of the day were\\nmastered, and under its influence they thought and wrote.\\nThus their work was conditioned by the nature of\\nscience itself, and by the age in which they lived. This work\\nthey did, and left to us a heritage of problems, of°terminol-ogy\\nterminology, and of principles which we are to solve, reject, or\\nemploy as best we may. And the best we can do is to thank\\nthem, and then go about our own work; the worst is to make\\nthem the dividing lines of schools, or settle in hostile camps\\naccording to their banners. We are not called upon to defend\\n\\n ― 51 ―\\n                            \\nthem, for their work is in the past; we are not called upon to\\nattack them, for our work is in the future.\\nIt will be of more use briefly to notice some of the\\nmovements and tendencies which have brought about the\\nchange of attitude, and created what may be called the\\n\"New Psychology.\"\\nNot the slightest of these movements has been, of\\ncourse, the reaction of the present century, from the°ab-stract\\nabstract, if clear, principles of the eighteenth, towards°con-crete\\nconcrete detail, even though it be confused. The general failure\\nof the eighteenth century in all but destructive°accomplish-ment\\naccomplishment forced the recognition of the fact that the universe is\\nnot so simple and easy a matter to deal with, after all; that\\nthere are many things in earth, to say nothing of heaven,\\nwhich were not dreamed of in the philosophy of clearness\\nand abstraction, whether that philosophy had been applied\\nalong the lines of the state, society, religion, or science. The\\nworld was sated with system and longed for fact. The age\\nbecame realistic. That the movement has been accompanied\\nwith at least temporary loss in many directions, with the\\nperishing of ideals, forgetfulness of higher purpose, decay of\\nenthusiasm, absorption in the petty, a hard contentedness in\\nthe present, or a cynical pessimism as to both present and\\nfuture, there can be no doubt. But neither may it be doubted\\nthat the movement was a necessity to bring the Antæus of\\nhumanity back to the mother soil of experience, whence it\\nderives its strength and very life, and to prevent it from\\nlosing itself in a substanceless vapor where its ideals and\\npurposes become as thin and watery as the clouds towards\\nwhich it aspires.\\nOut of this movement and as one of its best aspects\\ncame that organized, systematic, tireless study into the°se-crets\\nsecrets of nature, which, counting nothing common or°un-clean\\nunclean, thought no drudgery beneath it, or rather thought\\nnothing drudgery,—that movement which with its results\\nhad been the great revelation given to the nineteenth century\\nto make. In this movement psychology took its place, and in\\nthe growth of physiology which accompanied it I find the\\nfirst if not the greatest occasion of the development of the\\nNew Psychology.\\n\\n ― 52 ―\\n                            \\nIt is a matter in every one\\'s knowledge that, with the\\nincrease of knowledge regarding the structure and functions\\nof the nervous system, there has arisen a department of\\nscience known as physiological psychology, which has°al-ready\\nalready thrown great light upon psychical matters. But unless\\nI entirely misapprehend the popular opinion regarding the\\nmatter, there is very great confusion and error in this°opin-ion\\nopinion, regarding the relations of this science to psychology.\\nThis opinion, if I rightly gather it, is, that physiological\\npsychology is a science which does, or at least claims to,\\nexplain all psychical life by reference to the nature of the\\nnervous system. To illustrate: very many professed°popular-izers\\npopularizers of the results of scientific inquiry, as well as laymen,\\nseem to think that the entire psychology of vision is°ex-plained\\nexplained when we have a complete knowledge of the anatomy\\nof the retina, of its nervous connection with the brain, and of\\nthe centre in the latter which serves for visual functions; or\\nthat we know all about memory if we can discover that\\ncertain brain cells store up nervous impressions, and certain\\nfibres serve to connect these cells,—the latter producing the\\nassociation of ideas, while the former occasion their°repro-duction\\nreproduction. In short, the commonest view of physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology seems to be that it is a science which shows that\\nsome or all of the events of our mental life are physically\\nconditioned upon certain nerve-structures, and thereby°ex-plains\\nexplains these events. Nothing could be further from the truth.\\nSo far as I know, all the leading investigators clearly realize\\nthat explanations of psychical events, in order to explain,\\nmust themselves be psychical and not physiological.°How-ever\\nHowever important such knowledge as that of which we have\\njust been speaking may be for physiology, it has of itself no\\nvalue for psychology. It tells simply what and how°physio-logical\\nphysiological elements serve as a basis for psychical acts; what the\\nlatter are, or how they are to be explained, it tells us not at\\nall. Physiology can no more, of itself, give us the what, why,\\nand how of psychical life, than the physical geography of a\\ncountry can enable us to construct or explain the history of\\nthe nation that has dwelt within that country. However\\nimportant, however indispensable the land with all its°quali-ties\\nqualities is as a basis for that history, that history itself can be\\n\\n ― 53 ―\\n                            \\nascertained and explained only through historical records\\nand historic conditions. And so psychical events can be\\nobserved only through psychical means, and interpreted and\\nexplained by psychical conditions and facts.\\nWhat can be meant, then, by saying that the rise of\\nthis physiological psychology has produced a revolution in\\npsychology? This: that it has given a new instrument,°intro-duced\\nintroduced a new method,—that of experiment, which has°supple-mented\\nsupplemented and corrected the old method of introspection.\\nPsychical facts still remain psychical, and are to be°ex-plained\\nexplained through psychical conditions; but our means of\\nascertaining what these facts are and how they are°condi-tioned\\nconditioned have been indefinitely widened. Two of the chief°ele-ments\\nelements of the method of experiment are variation of°condi-tions\\nconditions at the will and under the control of the experimenter,\\nand the use of quantitative measurement. Neither of these\\nelements can be applied through any introspective process.\\nBoth may be through physiological psychology. This starts\\nfrom the well-grounded facts that the psychical events\\nknown as sensations arise through bodily stimuli, and that\\nthe psychical events known as volitions result in bodily\\nmovements; and it finds in these facts the possibility of the\\napplication of the method of experimentation. The bodily\\nstimuli and movements may be directly controlled and\\nmeasured, and thereby, indirectly, the psychical states which\\nthey excite or express.\\nThere is no need at this day to dwell upon the°advan-tages\\nadvantages derived in any science from the application of°experi-ment\\nexperiment. We know well that it aids observation by indefinitely\\nincreasing the power of analysis and by permitting exact\\nmeasurement, and that it equally aids explanation by°ena-bling\\nenabling us so to vary the constituent elements of the case\\ninvestigated as to select the indispensable. Nor is there need\\nto call attention to the especial importance of experiment in a\\nscience where introspection is the only direct means of°ob-servation\\nobservation. We are sufficiently aware of the defects of°intro-spection\\nintrospection. We know that it is limited, defective, and often\\nillusory as a means of observation, and can in no way°di-rectly\\ndirectly explain. To explain is to mediate; to connect the given\\nfact with an unseen principle; to refer the phenomenon to an\\n\\n ― 54 ―\\n                            \\nantecedent condition,—while introspection can deal only\\nwith the immediate present, with the given now. This is not\\nthe place to detail the specific results accomplished through\\nthis application of experiment to the psychological sphere;\\nbut two illustrations may perhaps be permitted: one from\\nthe realm of sensation, showing how it has enabled us to\\nanalyze states of consciousness which were otherwise°inde-composable\\nindecomposable; and the other from that of perception, showing\\nhow it has revealed processes which could be reached\\nthrough no introspective method.\\nIt is now well known that no sensation as it exists in\\nconsciousness is simple or ultimate. Every color sensation,\\nfor example, is made up by at least three fundamental°sen-sory\\nsensory quales, probably those of red, green, and violet; while\\nthere is every reason to suppose that each of these qualities,\\nfar from being simple, is compounded of an indefinite°num-ber\\nnumber of homogeneous units. Thus the simplest musical°sensa-tion\\nsensation has also been experimentally proved to be in reality not\\nsimple, but doubly compound. First, there is the number of\\nqualitatively like units constituting it which occasion the\\npitch of the note, according to the relations of time in which\\nthey stand to each other; and second, there is the relation\\nwhich one order of these units bears to other secondary\\norders, which gives rise to the peculiar timbre or tone-color\\nof the sound; while in a succession of notes these relations\\nare still further complicated by those which produce melody\\nand harmony. And all this complexity occurs, be it°remem-bered\\nremembered, in a state of consciousness which, to introspection, is\\nhomogeneous and ultimate. In these respects physiology has\\nbeen to psychology what the microscope is to biology, or\\nanalysis to chemistry. But the experimental method has done\\nmore than reveal hidden parts, or analyze into simpler°ele-ments\\nelements. It has aided explanation, as well as observation, by\\nshowing the processes which condition a psychical event.\\nThis is nowhere better illustrated than in visual perception.\\nIt is already almost a commonplace of knowledge that, for\\nexample, the most complex landscape which we can have\\nbefore our eyes, is, psychologically speaking, not a simple\\nultimate fact, nor an impression stamped upon us from\\nwithout, but is built up from color and muscular sensations,\\n\\n ― 55 ―\\n                            \\nwith, perhaps, unlocalized feelings of extension, by means of\\nthe psychical laws of interest, attention, and interpretation.\\nIt is, in short, a complex judgment involving within itself\\nemotional, volitional, and intellectual elements. The°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of the nature of these elements, and of the laws which\\ngovern their combination into the complex visual scene, we\\nowe to physiological psychology, through the new means of\\nresearch with which it has endowed us. The importance of\\nsuch a discovery can hardly be overestimated. In fact, this\\ndoctrine that our perceptions are not immediate facts, but\\nare mediated psychical processes, has been called by°Helm-holtz\\nHelmholtz the most important psychological result yet reached.\\nBut besides the debt we owe Physiology for the method\\nof experiment, is that which is due her for an indirect means\\nof investigation which she has put within our hands; and it is\\nthis aspect of the case which has led, probably, to such°mis-conceptions\\nmisconceptions of the relations of the two sciences as exist. For\\nwhile no direct conclusions regarding the nature of mental\\nactivities or their causes can be drawn from the character of\\nnervous structure or function, it is possible to reason°indi-rectly\\nindirectly from one to the other, to draw analogies and seek\\nconfirmation. That is to say, if a certain nervous°arrange-ment\\narrangement can be made out to exist, there is always a strong\\npresumption that there is a psychical process corresponding\\nto it; or if the connection between two physiological nerve\\nprocesses can be shown to be of a certain nature, one may\\nsurmise that the relation between corresponding psychical\\nactivities is somewhat analogous. In this way, by purely\\nphysiological discoveries, the mind may be led to suspect the\\nexistence of some mental activity hitherto overlooked, and\\nattention directed to its workings, or light may be thrown on\\npoints hitherto obscure. Thus it was, no doubt, the°physio-logical\\nphysiological discovery of the time occupied in transmission of a\\nnervous impulse that led the German psychologists to their\\nepoch-making investigations regarding the time occupied in\\nvarious mental activities; thus, too, the present°psychologi-cal\\npsychological theories regarding the relation of the intellectual and\\nvolitional tracts of minds were undoubtedly suggested and\\nlargely developed in analogy with Bell\\'s discovery of the\\ndistinct nature of the sensory and motor nerves. Again, the\\n\\n ― 56 ―\\n                            \\npresent theory that memory is not a chamber hall for storing\\nup ideas and their traces or relics, but is lines of activity\\nalong which the mind habitually works, was certainly°sug-gested\\nsuggested from the growing physiological belief that the brain\\ncells which form the physical basis of memory do not in any\\nway store up past impressions or their traces, but have, by\\nthese impressions, their structure so modified as to give rise\\nto a certain functional mode of activity. Thus many°impor-tant\\nimportant generalizations might be mentioned which were°sug-gested\\nsuggested and developed in analogy with physiological\\ndiscoveries.\\nThe influence of biological science in general upon\\npsychology has been very great. Every important°develop-ment\\ndevelopment in science contributes to the popular consciousness,\\nand indeed to philosophy, some new conception which serves\\nfor a time as a most valuable category of classification and\\nexplanation. To biology is due the conception of organism.\\nTraces of the notion are found long before the great rise of\\nbiological science, and, in particular, Kant has given a°com-plete\\ncomplete and careful exposition of it; but the great rôle which\\nthe \"organic\" conception has played of late is doubtless due\\nin largest measure to the growth of biology. In psychology\\nthis conception has led to the recognition of mental life as an\\norganic unitary process developing according to the laws of\\nall life, and not a theatre for the exhibition of independent\\nautonomous faculties, or a rendezvous in which isolated,\\natomic sensations and ideas may gather, hold external°con-verse\\nconverse, and then forever part. Along with this recognition of\\nthe solidarity of mental life has come that of the relation in\\nwhich it stands to other lives organized in society. The idea\\nof environment is a necessity to the idea of organism, and\\nwith the conception of environment comes the impossibility\\nof considering psychical life as an individual, isolated thing\\ndeveloping in a vacuum.\\nThis idea of the organic relation of the individual to\\nthat organized social life into which he is born, from which\\nhe draws his mental and spiritual sustenance, and in which\\nhe must perform his proper function or become a mental and\\nmoral wreck, forms the transition to the other great°influ-ence\\ninfluence which I find to have been at work in developing the\\nNew Psychology. I refer to the growth of those vast and as\\n\\n ― 57 ―\\n                            \\nyet undefined topics of inquiry which may be vaguely°desig-nated\\ndesignated as the social and historical sciences,—the sciences of\\nthe origin and development of the various spheres of man\\'s\\nactivity. With the development of these sciences has come\\nthe general feeling that the scope of psychology has been\\ncabined and cramped till it has lost all real vitality, and\\nthere is now the recognition of the fact that all these sciences\\npossess their psychological sides, present psychological°ma-terial\\nmaterial, and demand treatment and explanation at the hands\\nof psychology. Thus the material for the latter, as well as its\\nscope, have been indefinitely extended. Take the matter of\\nlanguage. What a wealth of material and of problems it\\noffers. How did it originate; was it contemporaneous with\\nthat of thought, or did it succeed it; how have they acted and\\nreacted upon each other; what psychological laws have been\\nat the basis of the development and differentiation of°lan-guages\\nlanguages, of the development of their structure and syntax, of\\nthe meaning of words, of all the rhetorical devices of°lan-guage\\nlanguage. Any one at all acquainted with modern discussions of\\nlanguage will recognize at a glance that the psychological\\npresentation and discussion of such problems is almost\\nenough of itself to revolutionize the old method of treating\\npsychology. In the languages themselves, moreover, we\\nhave a mine of resources, which, as a record of the°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of intelligence, can be compared only to the°impor-tance\\nimportance of the paleontological record to the student of animal\\nand vegetable life.\\nBut this is only one aspect, and not comparatively a\\nlarge one, of the whole field. Folk-lore and primitive culture,\\nethnology and anthropology, all render their contributions of\\nmatter, and press upon us the necessity of explanation. The\\norigin and development of myth, with all which it includes,\\nthe relation to the nationality, to language, to ethical ideas,\\nto social customs, to government and the state, is itself a\\npsychological field wider than any known to the previous\\ncentury. Closely connected with this is the growth of ethical\\nideas, their relations to the consciousness and activities of\\nthe nation in which they originate, to practical morality, and\\nto art. Thus I could go through the various spheres of\\nhuman activity, and point out how thoroughly they are\\npermeated with psychological questions and material. But it\\n\\n ― 58 ―\\n                            \\nsuffices to say that history in its broadest aspect is itself a\\npsychological problem, offering the richest resources of\\nmatter.\\nClosely connected with this, and also influential in the\\ndevelopment of the New Psychology, is that movement\\nwhich may be described as the commonest thoughts of every-\\nday life in all its forms, whether normal or abnormal. The\\ncradle and the asylum are becoming the laboratory of the\\npsychologist of the latter half of the nineteenth century. The\\nstudy of children\\'s minds, the discovery of their actual\\nthoughts and feelings from babyhood up, the order and\\nnature of the development of their mental life and the laws\\ngoverning it, promises to be a mine of greatest value. When\\nit was recognized that insanities are neither supernatural\\ninterruptions nor utterly inexplicable \"visitations,\" it°gradu-ally\\ngradually became evident that they were but exaggerations of\\ncertain of the normal workings of the mind, or lack of\\nproper harmony and co-ordination among these workings;\\nand thus another department of inquiries, of psychical°ex-periments\\nexperiments performed by nature, was opened to us, which has\\nalready yielded valuable results. Even the prison and the\\npenitentiary have made their contributions.\\nIf there be any need of generalizing the foregoing, we\\nmay say that the development of the New Psychology has\\nbeen due to the growth, on the one hand, of the science of\\nphysiology, giving us the method of experiment, and, on the\\nother, of the sciences of humanity in general, giving us the\\nmethod of objective observation, both of which indefinitely\\nsupplement and correct the old method of subjective\\nintrospection.\\nSo much for the occasioning causes and method of the\\nNew Psychology. Are its results asked for? It will be°gath-ered\\ngathered, from what has already been said, that its results cannot\\nbe put down in black and white like those of a mathematical\\ntheory. It is a movement, no system. But as a movement it\\nhas certain general features.\\nThe chief characteristic distinguishing it from the old\\npsychology is undoubtedly the rejection of a formal logic as\\nits model and test. The old psychologists almost without\\nexception held to a nominalistic logic. This of itself were a\\nmatter of no great importance, were it not for the inevitable\\n\\n ― 59 ―\\n                            \\ntendency and attempt to make living concrete facts of°expe-rience\\nexperience square with the supposed norms of an abstract,°life-less\\nlifeless thought, and to interpret them in accordance with its\\nformal conceptions. This tendency has nowhere been\\nstronger than in those who proclaimed that \"experience\"\\nwas the sole source of all knowledge. They emasculated\\nexperience till their logical conceptions could deal with it;\\nthey sheared it down till it would fit their logical boxes; they\\npruned it till it presented a trimmed tameness which would\\nshock none of their laws; they preyed upon its vitality till it\\nwould go into the coffin of their abstractions. And neither\\nso-called \"school\" was free from this tendency. The two\\nlegacies of fundamental principles which Hume left, were:\\nthat every distinct idea is a separate existence, and that\\nevery idea must be definitely determined in quantity and\\nquality. By the first he destroyed all relation but accident; by\\nthe second he denied all universality. But these principles\\nare framed after purely logical models; they are rather the\\nabstract logical principles of difference and identity, of A is\\nA and A is not B, put in the guise of a psychological°expres-sion\\nexpression. And the logic of concrete experience, of growth and\\ndevelopment, repudiates such abstractions. The logic of life\\ntranscends the logic of nominalistic thought. The reaction\\nagainst Hume fell back on certain ultimate, indecomposable,\\nnecessary first truths immediately known through some\\nmysterious simple faculty of the mind. Here again the°logi-cal\\nlogical model manifests itself. Such intuitions are not°psycholog-ical\\npsychological; they are conceptions bodily imported from the logical\\nsphere. Their origin, tests, and character are all logical. But\\nthe New Psychology would not have necessary truths about\\nprinciples; it would have the touch of reality in the life of the\\nsoul. It rejects the formalistic intuitionalism for one which\\nhas been well termed dynamic. It believes that truth, that\\nreality, not necessary beliefs about reality, is given in the\\nliving experience of the soul\\'s development.\\nExperience is realistic, not abstract. Psychical life is\\nthe fullest, deepest, and richest manifestation of this°experi-ence\\nexperience. The New Psychology is content to get its logic from\\nthis experience, and not do violence to the sanctity and\\nintegrity of the latter by forcing it to conform to certain\\npreconceived abstract ideas. It wants the logic of fact, of\\n\\n ― 60 ―\\n                            \\nprocess, of life. It has within its departments of knowledge\\nno psycho-statics, for it can nowhere find spiritual life at\\nrest. For this reason, it abandons all legal fiction of logical\\nand mathematical analogies and rules; and is willing to\\nthrow itself upon experience, believing that the mother\\nwhich has borne it will not betray it. But it makes no\\nattempts to dictate to this experience, and tell it what it must\\nbe in order to square with a scholastic logic. Thus the New\\nPsychology bears the realistic stamp of contact with life.\\nFrom this general characteristic result most of its°fea-tures\\nfeatures. It has already been noticed that it insists upon the\\nunity and solidarity of psychical life against abstract°the-ories\\ntheories which would break it up into atomic elements or°inde-pendent\\nindependent powers. It lays large stress upon the will; not as an\\nabstract power of unmotivated choice, nor as an executive\\npower to obey the behests of the understanding, the°legisla-tive\\nlegislative branch of the psychical government, but as a living\\nbond connecting and conditioning all mental activity. It\\nemphasizes the teleological element, not in any mechanical\\nor external sense, but regarding life as an organism in which\\nimmanent ideas or purposes are realizing themselves\\nthrough the development of experience. Thus modern°psy-chology\\npsychology is intensely ethical in its tendencies. As it refuses to\\nhypostatize abstractions into self-subsistent individuals, and\\nas it insists upon the automatic spontaneous elements in\\nman\\'s life, it is making possible for the first time an°ade-quate\\nadequate psychology of man\\'s religious nature and experience.\\nAs it goes into the depths of man\\'s nature it finds, as stone of\\nits foundation, blood of its life, the instinctive tendencies of\\ndevotion, sacrifice, faith, and idealism which are the eternal\\nsubstructure of all the struggles of the nations upon the altar\\nstairs which slope up to God. It finds no insuperable°prob-lems\\nproblems in the relations of faith and reason, for it can discover\\nin its investigations no reason which is not based upon faith,\\nand no faith which is not rational in its origin and tendency.\\nBut to attempt to give any detailed account of these features\\nof the New Psychology would be to go over much of the\\nrecent discussions of ethics and theology. We can conclude\\nonly by saying that, following the logic of life, it attempts to\\ncomprehend life.\\n\\n ― 61 ―\\n                            \\nThe Obligation to Knowledge of God [First published in the Monthly Bulletin, Students\\' Christian\\nAssociation, University of Michigan, VI (Nov. 1884), 23-25. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe scriptures are uniform in their treatment of scepticism.\\nThere is an obligation to know God, and to fail to meet this\\nobligation is not to err intellectually, but to sin morally.\\nBelief is not a privilege, but a duty,-\"whatsoever is not of\\nfaith is sin.\" To a generation like ours this is a hard saying.\\nWe treat sceptics not as those who have failed to meet a\\nduty, but as unfortunates whose peculiar mental constitution\\nis depriving them of the blessings of God\\'s presence. Many\\nsceptics declare that their greatest sorrow is that they live as\\norphans in an orphaned world, without the Divine Father,\\nand that their greatest joy would be the knowledge of Him.\\nBut the statements of Christ and his immediate followers are\\nexplicit. To fail to get knowledge in these matters is not an\\nintellectual, but a moral defect.\\nAnd there are reasons for believing that there is a\\ndeeper and more adequate knowledge of man in these°state-ments\\nstatements than in our modern view. The modern view results\\nfrom a false theory of the origin, and of the nature of\\nknowledge. We have separated it from will. We have°iso-lated\\nisolated truth from duty. We have forgotten that every fact\\nknown demands something of us; we have forgotten that\\nthere is no knowledge except as our desires, our interests, our\\npurposes, in short, the whole bent of our moral nature is\\nconcerned. It is then two facts: that knowledge does not\\nbecome real knowledge until the commands which it lays\\nupon the will have been executed, and that knowledge°can-not\\ncannot arise except as our feelings and desires are involved that\\n\\n ― 62 ―\\n                            \\nenable us to grasp the Biblical statements as sober facts,\\nhard as they seem.\\nThere has never been a time when the accumulation of\\nfacts was regarded so universally as an end in itself as at\\npresent. It is also said that there was never a time when\\nscepticism was so prevalent as now. These statements are\\nrelated as cause and effect. Thousands are spending their\\ntime and their strength in investigating the minutest facts of\\nnature and of history. And this is well; but it is not so well\\nthat this leads to the shutting out of all beyond, simply\\nbecause we are contented with this. These facts are not yet\\nknowledge, until they have been brought into relation with\\nthe whole nature of man, or with his activities, social and\\nmoral. A purely intellectual life is an unhealthy, one-sided\\nlife. The evangelist, ignorant though he be, who is in°con-stant\\nconstant contact with the needs, the sins, the desires and the\\naspirations of actual human nature is a better judge of\\nreligious truth, than the man of science, if a truly°specula-tive\\nspeculative life has shut him off from sympathy and living intimacy\\nwith the fundamental truths of the common nature of man.\\nAll knowledge is one. It is all of God, the universe, say\\nrather, of God; and if any set of facts are regarded as\\nsomething in themselves, out of all relation to God and\\nGod\\'s creatures, it is no knowledge. The whole world of\\nnature and history is worthless except as it is brought into\\nrelation with man\\'s nature and activities; and that science or\\nphilosophy is worthless which does not ultimately bring\\nevery fact into guiding relation with the living activity of\\nman, and the end of all his striving-approach to God. He\\nthat does the Will, alone has real knowledge.\\nThe other error is that we have considered knowledge\\nin its origin as a faculty apart, separate from our will and\\nour desires. But the fact is that there is no knowledge of\\nanything except as our interests are alive to the matter, and\\nour will actively directed toward the end desired. We know\\nonly what we most want to know. To know or not to know is\\nnot a colorless intellectual thing, involving no part of man\\'s\\nmoral nature. It is an essentially moral thing. We must seek\\nin order to find, and we find that for which we seek. If the\\ndesires and will of man are for God, he will find God in all\\n\\n ― 63 ―\\n                            \\nhis knowledge. If there is not this attitude, man\\'s°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, though it extend never so far, will never reach unto\\nGod. He has been shut out from the start. The man whose\\ninterest in the world is not great enough to lead him to open\\nhis eyes will never see light. The man whose interest in the\\nthings of God is not great enough to lead him to direct his\\neyes to the things of God, will never see the light of the\\nworld. Man\\'s knowledge or his lack of it depends wholly\\nupon this original attitude of his will and desires toward\\nGod; and because these are under his control, because these\\nexpress his moral tendency, his knowledge does also. God is\\neverlastingly about us, and to fail to know Him is to show\\nthat we do not wish to know Him.\\n\\n ― 64 ―\\n                            \\nEducation and the Health of Women [First published in Science, VI (16 Oct. 1885), 341-42. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe tendency to apply the exact methods of science to°prob-lems\\nproblems of education, is one of the most hopeful signs of present\\npedagogy. One of the more fruitful lines of application will\\nbe found, doubtless, in the consideration of educational°ques-tions\\nquestions in relation to the wider sphere of social science, and the\\napplication of the statistical method. As one of the first fruits\\nof this application, we hail the returns collected by the\\nAssociation of Collegiate Alumnæ, wisely embodied in the\\ncurrent report of the Massachusetts Labor Bureau. These\\nare directed especially to ascertaining the effect of education\\nupon the health of women, but there are incidentally°dis-cussed\\ndiscussed a number of other very interesting problems. The\\nreturns include 12 institutions, which had (1882) graduated\\n1,290 women, from 705 or 54.65 per cent of whom returns\\nhave been received. Of these the average age at beginning\\nstudy was 5.6 years; at beginning of menstrual period, 13.6\\nyears; at entering college, 18.3 years; and at the present\\ntime, 28.5 years. This gives about six years as the average\\ntime since graduation, certainly ample for the determination\\nof the general effects upon health of their collegiate training.\\nOf the 705, 19.5 per cent report a deterioration in health\\nduring college life; 59.3 per cent, no change; 21.1 per cent,\\nan improvement. The corresponding figures for working\\ngirls of Boston show a deterioration of 16 per cent, a°favor-able\\nfavorable balance of 3.5 per cent in favor of the working girls.\\nThe total number of disorders reported by the 705 is 868.\\nThe ætiology of disease, as reported, is exceedingly°defec-tive\\n ― 65 ―\\n                            \\ndefective, but we give it for what it is worth. 135 consider°consti-tutional\\nconstitutional weakness cause of disorders; 81 bad sanitary°condi-tions\\nconditions; 81 intellectual overwork; 73 emotional strain, and 47\\nphysical accident, while the others report no cause.°Defec-tive\\nDefective as this report is in detail, it is remarkably suggestive.\\nThe general conclusion stated in the report is that the health\\nof women engaged in the pursuit of a college education, does\\nnot suffer more than that of a corresponding number of\\nother women in other occupations, or without occupation.\\nThis general conclusion may be allowed to stand. But\\nthe figures are not \"worked for all they are worth.\" A more\\ndetailed examination of them brings out the following points\\nwhich the report fails to explicitly notice.\\nOf those who entered college one or two years after the\\ncommencement of the menstrual function 20.5 per cent had\\npoor health during the four years of college life, while of\\nthose entering three to five years after its establishment 17.7\\nper cent, and more than five years 15.4 per cent had poor\\nhealth. The following figures tell the same story with slight\\nvariation: of those who entered at the age of sixteen, or\\nunder, 28.1 per cent deteriorated, 17.2 per cent improved in\\nhealth; of those seventeen to nineteen 17.3 per cent°deterio-rated\\ndeteriorated and 19.7 per cent improved; while of those who were\\ntwenty or over 17.9 per cent deteriorated, while 28.4 per cent\\nimproved—almost exactly reversing the figures for the\\nyoungest class. The fact that of the married 37 per cent are\\nwithout children, although the average number of years\\nspent in married life is 6.2, must be included in any°discus-sion\\ndiscussion that wishes to reach complete results. There were,\\nmoreover, to those bearing children but an average of two\\nchildren to every seven years of married life, while, if all\\nmarried couples are included, the average falls to 1.2°chil-dren\\nchildren for five years. With such statistics, however, there\\nmust be borne in mind the general falling off in fertility of\\nall women occupying about the same social rank. Of the\\nchildren born, 12 per cent have died, and of these the°unu-sually\\nunusually large per cent of 25 is due to causes occurring°contem-porary\\ncontemporary with birth, still, premature birth, etc.\\nThe following figures fall into the same category.°Dur-ing\\nDuring the period of development 53 per cent were troubled\\n\\n ― 66 ―\\n                            \\nduring the menstrual period with disorders, including°irreg-ularities\\nirregularities, uterine and reflex pain, one, two, or all three.\\nDuring college life the per cent was 66; since graduation 64.\\nIf mere irregularities be isolated, and they and the more\\norganic disturbances treated separately we find:°Irregulari-ties\\nIrregularities alone-development, 16 per cent; college life, 9 per cent;\\ngraduate life, 7 per cent. Uterine and reflex°pain—develop-ment\\npain—development 24 per cent; college life, 36 per cent; graduate life, 36\\nper cent. Of the disorders reported 7 per cent are brain\\ntroubles, 33 per cent nervousness, in addition to which 15\\nper cent report neuralgia; 26 per cent disorders of generative\\norgans.\\nWe give only figures, and these only such as bear\\ndirectly upon the central question of the health of woman in\\nreference to her education. They certainly show that the\\ntime for optimistic congratulations is not yet reached.\\nThe other general conclusion of the report that such\\nfalling off in health during college life, as did appear, is due\\nrather to predisposing causes, than directly attributable to\\ncollege life itself, brings out some very interesting°contribu-tions\\ncontributions to the scanty generalizations we already possess,°con-cerning\\nconcerning the relations between health and social environment.\\nFirst as to heredity: A total of 35 per cent report a tendency\\nto disease inherited from one or both parents. Those°inherit-ing\\ninheriting tendency from one parent only present some slight°fall-ing\\nfalling off in good health when compared with the entire°aver-age\\naverage; while for those inheriting from both 58.3 per cent are in\\ngood health; 41.7 in poor, the average for all being 83 and 17\\nper cent respectively. For the 65 per cent inheriting°tenden-cies\\ntendencies from neither the figures are 85 and 15. As to relative\\nchange there is for those inheriting from both a relative\\ndecrease of 19.5 per cent in those having excellent health; an\\nincrease of 24.6 per cent in those having poor; the°corre-sponding\\ncorresponding figures for those inheriting from neither being an\\nincrease in good health of 2.6 per cent, a decrease of poor of\\n1.6.

For the\\nsocial student, however, it presents certain notable°deficien-cies\\ndeficiencies.

Such vague\\nexpressions are worse than none. The question is as to how\\nthe student spent the hours of social recreation, and how\\nmany were so spent. The complete answer of this question,\\nit is hardly too much to say, would throw more light on the\\nhygienic problem than almost all else. It should include\\ninformation as to whether the institution is female only or\\nco-educational; what its social relations are to the town in\\nwhich it is situated, the nature of the town; whether the\\nyoung women live in dormitories, in cottages, in selected\\nhomes, or in ordinary boarding-houses; what regulations, if\\nany, the faculty have made concerning study hours, and the\\nhours not spent in study; whether the institution has a°ma-tron\\nmatron; whether her duties extend to moral and social matters,\\nor to physical only; whether the institution has a°gymna-sium\\ngymnasium, etc. Complete answers to such a protocol of questions\\nas these suggest would show what was meant by saying that\\n81 regard bad sanitary conditions as cause of their diseases,\\n135, constitutional weakness, and 73, emotional strain. If the\\nassociation will study the conditions of the problem along\\nthis line, and frame questions accordingly, they will deserve\\nstill more at the hands of both the scientific educator, and\\nthe social student. Meanwhile we will be thankful for what\\nwe have.\\n\\n ― 69 ―\\n                            \\nHealth and Sex in Higher Education [First published in Popular Science Monthly, XXVIII (Mar. 1886),\\n606-14. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nIt may not generally be known that the alumnæ of the more\\nimportant centers of female higher education in this country\\nhave an organized intercollegiate association for the°promo-tion\\npromotion of woman\\'s education and the study of questions°re-garding\\nregarding her training. This association has justified its°exist-ence\\nexistence, if justification were necessary, by the inquiries which\\nit has made regarding the health of those women who have\\npursued college courses. The importance of the results thus\\nobtained has led to their incorporation in the ^ current report\\nof the Massachusetts Labor Bureau. For the first time the\\ndiscussion is taken from the a priori realm of theory on the\\none hand, and the hap-hazard estimate of physician and\\ncollege instructor on the other. The returns have the value of\\nall good statistics: they not only enable us to come to some\\nconclusion upon the main point discussed, but they are so\\nfull and varied that they suggest and mark the way toward\\nthe discussion of a large number of other hardly less°impor-tant\\nimportant questions. The figures, in short, call up as many°prob-lems\\nproblems as they settle, thus fulfilling the first requisite of°fruit-ful\\nfruitful research.\\nPursuing this line, we shall first state the general°char-acter\\ncharacter of the investigation followed and conclusions reached;\\nand, secondly, isolate a few special problems for more°de-tailed\\ndetailed though brief treatment. The result may be summed\\nup in the words of the report, as follows: \"The female\\ngraduates of our colleges and universities do not seem to\\nshow, as the result of their college studies and duties, any\\n\\n ― 70 ―\\n                            \\nmarked difference in general health from the average health\\nlikely to be reported by an equal number of women engaged\\nin other kinds of work. It is true that there has been, and it\\nwas to be expected that there would be, a certain°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health on the part of some of the graduates. On the\\nother hand, an almost identical improvement in health for a\\nlike number was reported, showing very plainly that we\\nmust look elsewhere for the causes of the greater part of this\\ndecline in health during college-life. If we attempt to trace\\nthe cause, we find that this deterioration is largely due, not\\nto the requirements of college-life particularly, but to°predis-posing\\npredisposing causes natural to the graduates themselves, born in\\nthem, as it were, and for which college-life or study should\\nnot be made responsible.\"\\nThrough some oversight the statement is made that the\\nreturns include statistics from every higher institution in the\\nUnited States open to women; while, as a matter of fact, it\\nincludes a not comparatively large number. The institutions\\nrepresented, however, are typical. The data are contained in\\nTable I.\\nFor purposes of comparison, the value of the statistics\\nis vitiated by the fact that the date of the admission of\\nwomen is not given, and this, in the cases of the°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational college, does not agree with the date of organization.\\nOther facts, which we omit, go to show that the average date\\nof admission, Oberlin being excluded, may be safely put at\\nabout 1870.\\nThe questions involved in the inquiry were exceedingly\\ncomprehensive, and may conveniently be considered under\\nthree heads, of which the first takes up the conditions of\\nchildhood, comprehending date of birth, nationality of°par-ents\\nparents, surroundings in childhood, amount of exercise received\\nbetween the ages of eight and fourteen, the age at which\\nstudy began, the age at entering college, and the age at\\ngraduation.

Of these one of the\\nmost important compares the present health of graduates\\nwith the age at beginning study, the age at entering college,\\nthe time entering college after the menstrual period°com-menced\\ncommenced, the amount of out-of-door exercise, and hereditary\\nconditions. Another compares the health during college-life\\nwith the age at entering, the amount of study performed, the\\namount of worry about private and college affairs, etc. The\\nfirst set is thus seen to be occupied with giving a picture of\\nhealth through life, while the second endeavors to ascertain\\nthe changes introduced by college-life, and their causes.\\nThe general features of the tables may be stated as\\nfollows [in Table II].\\nThe influence upon health may be summed up very\\ngenerally as follows: The maximum per cent of good health,\\n78.1, is reported at the time of entering college; during\\n\\n ― 72 ―\\n                            \\ncollege-life this falls off to 74.9 per cent, to be followed by a\\nrise to 77.9 per cent since graduation; fair health shows a\\ngain from 2 to 8 per cent during college-life, followed by a\\ndecrease to 5 per cent since that time; while there was an\\nactual decrease of 2 per cent during college-life of those\\nhaving poor health, the figures being respectively 19.8 and\\n17.3 per cent, no appreciable change being shown for the\\nyears since graduation.\\nII.

This result may be compared with\\nthe returns of the inquiries instituted by the Massachusetts\\nBoard among the working-girls of Boston, as follows: Of\\nthe 705 female college graduates, 138, or 19.58 per cent,\\nshow a deterioration in health during college-life, and of the\\n1,032 working-girls, 166, or 16.09 per cent, show a°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health, during working-time, these figures indicating\\na greater loss of health, of 3.49 per cent, reported by the\\ncollege graduates. For the 166 working-girls, whose health\\ndeteriorated, four had quite good health at the time of the\\ninvestigation, 128 were in fair health, and 34 in poor health.\\n\\n ― 73 ―\\n                            \\nOf the 138 college graduates whose health deteriorated,\\nhowever, 42 report a decline in health from excellent to\\ngood, or a slight change only. Making allowances for this,\\nthere is a greater loss of health of 2.47 per cent reported by\\nthe working-girls of Boston.\\nOf the 705 reporting, 417, or 59 per cent, mention some\\ndisorder, and the total number of disorders reported is 868.\\nThe returns regarding the causation of disease, while not\\ntechnical nor detailed enough for scientific value, are\\nsuggestive.\\nOf the 417 reporting disorders, 276 give the cause or\\ncauses of disorders, and for 141 no cause is reported. One\\nhundred and thirty-five consider constitutional weakness to\\nhave been the cause of disorder; 81, bad sanitary conditions;\\n81, intellectual overwork; 73, emotional strain; and 47,°phys-ical\\nphysical accidents.\\nThe average amount of exercise reported, considering\\nthe aversion of American women, especially the educated, to\\nbodily exertion, may be considered fairly encouraging. The\\naverage distance walked per day is given at 2.5 miles, and\\nthe time spent in other exercise as 1.2 hour. Returns°regard-ing\\nregarding the amount of college-study done by college-women\\nwould gain in interest if they could be put side by side with\\ncorresponding returns from their male companions: 4, or\\n0.57 per cent, studied but little while at college; 438, or 62.13\\nper cent, studied moderately; 64, or 9.08 per cent, between\\nmoderately and severely, and 199, or 28.22 per cent,\\nseverely.\\nEither the lazy students failed to report, or college-\\nwomen have much to learn from the average male°under-graduate\\nundergraduate about the science of laziness. The lonely four, who\\nhave the courage of their disposition, all come from one\\ncollege, which it would be ungallant to specify. Statistics\\nconcerning worry show that the art of taking things easy is\\nnot yet mastered by our ambitious young women: 172, or\\n24.40 per cent, worried over their studies; 89, or 12.62 per\\ncent, over personal affairs; 131, or 18.58 per cent, worried\\nover both studies and affairs; while 313, or 44.40 per cent,\\nworried over neither studies nor affairs.\\nThese returns for the most part tell their own tale and\\n\\n ― 74 ―\\n                            \\npoint their own moral. They certainly bear out the°conclu-sion\\nconclusion drawn regarding the uninjurious effect of collegiate\\nstudy. Their great defect is in their failure to show more\\ndefinitely the conditions and surroundings of college-life.\\nThe physical, social, and moral environment should be°care-fully\\ncarefully studied. It has long been a commonplace of vital°sci-ence\\nscience that intellectual pursuits for men per se are healthy.\\nThe question which needs solution is, What conditions°pre-vent\\nprevent their being equally healthy for women, the exact part\\nplayed by each factor, and how far it is removable? What\\nparents as well as professional educators and college°admin-istrators\\nadministrators wish to know is, what colleges have gymnasiums,\\nand whether the exercise is compulsory; how many°institu-tions\\ninstitutions have matrons, and how far their influence extends; how\\nmany have resident physicians. Do the young women live\\nherded in halls, sheltered in cottages, or at home and at\\nboarding-houses as convenience dictates? The number of\\nhours of sleep taken should be exactly stated. The number of\\nhours of study should be given, instead of the vague terms\\n\"moderate,\" etc. Instead of indefinite inquiries as to\\nwhether the student went into society much or little, exact\\ninquiries into the various modes of spending the hours of\\nsocial recreation should be made. These and many similar\\npoints, which would suggest themselves at once, may be\\nconsidered trivial; but, if we accept the general conclusion of\\nthe report that the pursuit of collegiate education is not in\\nitself harmful, the importance of studying the entire°envi-ronment\\nenvironment, physical and social, of the young student at once\\nappears. Here, in fact, the problem of her education\\ncenters.\\nTurning from the general conclusion to the°considera-tion\\nconsideration of certain specific problems, we educe the following\\ndata for discussion:\\nBy all odds the most important fact regarding the\\nhigher education of woman is, that we are educating wives\\nand mothers. Few probably will regret this, but those few\\nmust still admit the fact in a society constituted like ours.\\nThis, then, is the heart of the situation, and, in view of it,\\nthe following statistics are suggestive:\\nOmitting Oberlin College, for reasons already given,\\n\\n ― 75 ―\\n                            \\n26 per cent of the graduates who report are married, the\\nother 74 per cent single. The average number of years since\\ngraduation is, however, over six, and average age over\\ntwenty-seven. Of the married, 37 per cent are without°chil-dren\\nchildren, although the average number of years married is 6.2.\\nThe one hundred and nine having children report 205. Of\\nthese, 12 per cent have died, and, of these deaths, 25 per cent\\nare due to causes connected with bearing. If we include all\\nmarried couples, there is but 1.2 child to every five years of\\nmarried life; and, even if we exclude those not having borne\\nany, there are, among the remainder, two children to seven\\nyears of married life. We leave these figures, as the others,\\nto speak for themselves.\\nThat three hundred report their post-graduate°occupa-tions\\noccupations as teaching, and that one hundred and sixteen are\\nfollowing a professional life, shows a fact too easily lost\\nsight of. Collegiate courses for woman have not solved the\\nproblem of her education, but, at most, of her technical\\ntraining. It can hardly be thought desirable that 60 per cent\\nof all the young women of our country, who ought to have\\ncollegiate training, should have it only as a preparation for\\none of the professions or for teaching. The question of\\nwomen\\'s education, in any worthy sense of the term°educa-tion\\neducation, has yet to be faced. The remarkable fact that the\\ncourses for female education, as well in purely female°insti-tutions\\ninstitutions as in co-educational, run parallel with and are°mod-eled\\nmodeled after the curriculum of male colleges, is to be accounted\\nfor only on the ground that upon the whole their training is\\ndesigned for those who have to compete with men in the\\nprofessional walks of life.\\nIf we confine ourselves to the health of women, we\\nshall find that the figures hardly justify us in assuming a\\npurely optimistic attitude. The following figures speak for\\nthemselves: Of those who entered college one or two years\\nafter the commencement of the menstrual period, 20.5 per\\ncent had poor health during college-life; of those who°en-tered\\nentered three to five years after, but 17.7 per cent; and more\\nthan five years, 15.4 per cent. If we compare the ages at\\nentering college with the relative improvement or°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health, we reach the same result. Of those who\\n\\n ― 76 ―\\n                            \\nentered college at sixteen years or under, 28 per cent fell off\\nin health, while 17 per cent gained. The figures for those of\\ntwenty and over show an almost exact reversal of these\\npercentages, being 18 per cent loss and 28.5 per cent gain.\\nThe problem of age is thus seen to be an exceedingly°impor-tant\\nimportant one.\\nThe fact that, of the disorders reported, 7 per cent are\\nbrain troubles, 26 per cent of reproductive organs, and 33\\nper cent nervousness (also 15 per cent of neuralgia), shows\\nthat the problem of health has yet to find its adequate\\nsolution. The following percentages tell the same story:\\nDuring the period of development, 53 per cent were troubled\\nduring the menstrual period (with simple irregularities,\\nuterine or reflex pain, one or all). During college-life the per\\ncent was 66; since graduation, 64. If we isolate simple°irreg-ularities\\nirregularities, the result is more significant still; for these show a\\nconstant decrease, while the organic troubles show as\\nmarked an increase, the figures being, respectively, for°ir-regularities\\nirregularities, 16 per cent, 9 per cent, 7 per cent; for uterine\\nand reflex pain, 24 per cent, 36 per cent, 36 per cent, for the\\nthree periods of development, college, and graduate life.\\nSuch percentages show along what line effort should be\\ndirected.\\nLeaving this question, we turn to the phenomena of\\ncollege-life, so far as regards exercise, study, and worry, in\\ntheir effects upon health. The tables here cease to have\\nreference, in their bearing, to women alone, and point a\\nmoral for all educators to heed. The importance of exercise\\nis shown by the fact that those reporting over two hours per\\nday return 84 per cent in good or fair health, while those\\nbelow two hours can show but 75 per cent. It is hardly an\\nexaggeration to say that, upon the whole, the tables show\\nthat worry is the most potent of all predisposing causes of\\ndisease. Those who had no worries of account report 92 per\\ncent in fair or good health; those worrying over both°per-sonal\\npersonal affairs and studies state that but 68 per cent of their\\nnumber were in the same condition. Worry over personal\\nmatters seems to be more harmful to health than°overstud-ies\\noverstudies, 75 and 80 per cent being the proportion of good health\\nrespectively. This showing goes far in substantiating the\\n\\n ― 77 ―\\n                            \\nopinion of those who hold that study per se is never a cause\\nof failure of health. However, of those who studied severely,\\n21 per cent report poor health, against 15 per cent of those\\nstudying moderately. Again, of the latter, 54 per cent report\\ndisorders as against 70 per cent of those who studied more;\\nthe figures for nervousness also are 15 and 26 per cent\\nrespectively. It is fair to suppose, however, that the largest\\nper cent of those worrying over their studies was found\\namong those studying severely.\\nIn the tables, the distinction is made between those\\nreporting from female colleges only and those of the°co-edu-cational\\nco-educational. It is an easy matter, however, to separate them,\\nwhich I have done, with the following results: Of the whole\\nnumber (705), 458 are from female colleges; 247°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational. For graduate life, the figures for health are exactly\\nthe same for both: 83 per cent in good health, and 17 per\\ncent in poor. During college-life 16 per cent of the°co-educa-tionalists\\nco-educationalists report poor health, as against 18 per cent of those\\nfrom female colleges; but this is more than accounted for by\\nthe fact that 22 per cent of the latter were in poor health\\nbefore entering, showing a real gain during college-life of 4\\nper cent in average health, while the reports of°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational colleges show a gain of but one per cent. It must be\\nnoticed, however, that the female colleges show a falling off\\nof 4.8 per cent from good to fair health, while the°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational show a similar loss of but 0.3 per cent. The average\\nnumber of disorders reported is much the same for each\\nclass: 1.19 for graduates of female colleges; 1.24 for the\\nother class. The figures as given show that either more care\\nis taken of personal health in the female colleges than in the\\nco-educational, or that more supervision is exercised; for 55\\nper cent of the former report abstinence from study and\\nexercise during the menstrual period, and only 25 per cent of\\nthe latter. The figures for disorders show no corresponding\\ngain, however, the advantage here being on the side of the\\nco-educational institutions, as the latter report 33 per cent of\\ndisorders of brain, nerves, and reproductive organs, against\\n41 per cent in the female colleges. The figures for worry are\\nabout the same in each class: 33 per cent report severe study\\nin the co-educational colleges, as against 26 per cent in the\\n\\n ― 78 ―\\n                            \\nother; the advantage in exercise is, however, somewhat on\\nthe side of the co-educational college. The figures in the\\ncausation of disorders show the same percentages arising\\nfrom intellectual overwork and physical accident. The°fe-male\\nfemale colleges, however, report proportionately over one\\nthird more breaking down from emotional strain, while the\\nco-educational colleges balance the account with one fourth\\nmore failing in health by reason of bad sanitary conditions.\\nOf the life since graduation, not much can be said: 23\\nper cent of the graduates of the female colleges have°mar-ried\\nmarried; 28 per cent of the co-educational, the average age of\\neach being the same. Competition with men seems to have\\nled a less number of graduates of co-educational colleges to\\nenter the professions; at all events they report but 12 per\\ncent in the professions, while the female colleges report 21\\nper cent. A somewhat larger number follow teaching,°how-ever\\nhowever, the figures here being 48 per cent and 42 per cent\\nrespectively.\\nIt would certainly be too much to say from these°fig-ures\\nfigures that the personal care and advice from others given in\\nfemale colleges are greater, while the social surroundings in\\nthe co-educational colleges are healthier, because perhaps\\nmore natural; but they suggest the advisability of questions\\ndirected to these points. The female colleges seem to have\\nthe advantage in purely sanitary conditions (except amount\\nof exercise), as witnessed by the smaller percentage°report-ing\\nreporting bad sanitation as cause of disease; by the advantage of\\nmore than two to one of abstinence from study at critical\\nperiods, and in moderation of study; while the advantage of\\nhealth remains on the side of the co-educational during\\ncollege-life. That the balance shifts after graduation would\\npoint in the line of the generalization already suggested; as\\nwith the cessation of college-life would cease the abnormal\\ncloistering of the young women, while bad sanitary°condi-tions\\nconditions would show comparatively permanent results. That\\nproportionately one third more in the female colleges report\\nemotional strain as cause of disorders, other causes showing\\nmuch the same average, points in the same direction. At any\\nrate, it is worth inquiry whether it is not possible to unite the\\npresumed advantage of the female colleges in wise advice\\n\\n ― 79 ―\\n                            \\nand proper attention to health with the freer and more\\nnatural social relations of the co-educational institutions.\\nIt is hoped that enough has been said to show the\\nimportance of the investigations already made, and to justify\\nthe supposition that further more detailed and extended\\ninquiries would increase their value. No educator at all\\nacquainted with the present status of affairs will carp at the\\nresults already reached, nor will he find much but cause for\\nthankfulness upon a survey of the field; but his outlook must\\nbe directed toward the future, not the past. Nothing could\\nwell be more fatal to the cause of woman\\'s education than to\\nsuppose that the question is already settled. The°commence-ment\\ncommencement has indeed been made, but only the commencement.\\nMere multiplication of institutions and influences of the\\nexisting type, however valuable, as affording opportunities\\nto individual young women, will do little toward°determin-ing\\ndetermining the larger aspects of the case. Were the number of\\npurely women\\'s colleges largely increased, and were all the\\nimportant boys\\' colleges to open their doors to girls, only the\\nnecessary basis for the solution of the problem would be\\nobtained.\\nSuch inquiries as we have briefly summarized can do\\nmore than aught else to furnish necessary data for a wise\\nand comparatively permanent solution. Discussion on°parti-san\\npartisan lines is absolutely valueless, and a priori discussion will\\neffect nothing. The unbiased study by educational experts of\\nthe fruits actually borne by experience is invaluable, and the\\ngeneralizations based upon such data will show the lines\\nupon which reform must work itself out. This is not the\\nplace to formulate the exact nature of such inquiries, but\\nthey should cover at least three heads:\\n1. HEALTH. The present report offers a valuable model to\\nfollow. More attention should be given to the social and\\nmoral environment of college-life, however, even in this\\npoint; and the discussion should more definitely concern the\\nspecifically female functions.\\n2. LIFE SINCE GRADUATION. The brief notes respecting\\nmarriages and occupations in the report discussed are all we\\n\\n ― 80 ―\\n                            \\nhave on this head. It should be treated with a view to\\ndetermining as accurately as may be the position which the\\ncollege-educated woman holds and desires to hold in the\\nbody social and politic. When we recollect the difficulty in\\nadjusting young men\\'s collegiate education to their life after\\ngraduation, in spite of the accumulation of infinite°experi-ence\\nexperience, the value of such a report in determining the lines\\nwhich woman\\'s college education should follow, in the\\ndearth of information upon the topic, is at once seen.\\n\\n3. SPECIFIC DATA FOR FUTURE MOVEMENTS. These\\nshould be based upon confidential revelations made by the\\ngraduates themselves, together with the testimony of college\\nofficers and physicians. It should not be limited narrowly.\\nThey should go far beyond the question of bodily health.\\nThe statement of what each had found the greatest aid and\\nthe greatest hindrance in her collegiate training would be of\\nmuch value. Experience alone can decide the exact form\\nwhich these inquiries should take, but their importance can\\nhardly be over-estimated in the moral and social aspects of\\nthe case.\\nEducation must follow the example of the special°sci-ences\\nsciences. It must organize. There is organization, and to spare,\\nin the schools themselves; what we want is organized°recog-nition\\nrecognition of the problems of education; organized study for the\\ndiscovery of methods of solution; organized application of\\nthese methods in the details of school-life. Co-operation in\\nresearch and application is the key to the problem.\\n\\n ― 81 ―\\n                            \\nPsychology in High-Schools from the Standpoint of the College [First published in Michigan School-Masters\\' Club Papers, 1886\\n(Lansing, Michigan: H. R. Pattengill, [1886]). 4 pp. Reproduced\\nin facsimile by Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor, 1947. Notpre-viously\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nA Paper Read at the First Meeting\\nof the Michigan School-Masters\\' Club,\\nby Dr. John Dewey,\\nof the University of Michigan\\n\\nI have to confess at the outset that I have prepared this\\npaper rather because I am interested in the subject than\\nbecause I think myself to know anything about it. I am in\\nneed of information and am correspondingly glad to have\\nthe chance of exposing my ignorance. In fact, I am inclined\\nto congratulate myself on the deficiencies of my own°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, as these may be the surest method of calling out the\\nwider experience and better former judgments of others.\\nHaving made this general confession, it remains only to\\nmake it specific by adding that not only have I never taught\\npsychology in a high-school, but that I have never been as\\nstudent or as teacher in a school where it is taught. I may lay\\nclaim to the impartiality born of ignorance, and the°doctri-narianism\\ndoctrinarianism bred of the lack of practice.\\nI do not wish, however, to carry my presumption too\\nfar; and accordingly I suggest that there may be two ways\\nof looking at the educational value of my subject, since that\\nsubject has two functions; one direct and immediate, the\\nother, remote. There is, in the first place, the precise and\\naccurate training which the mind receives at the time of\\nstudy, together with the information gathered. But there is\\n\\n ― 82 ―\\n                            \\nalso that training which puts the mind in an enlarged, yes,\\nin a new attitude to all subjects with which it may thereafter\\ncome in contact, whether in the regulated discipline of°col-lege\\ncollege life, or in the more accidental and wider education of\\nlife. Of the first of these two functions I shall not attempt to\\nsay anything. The few things I shall say are upon the study\\nof psychology from the standpoint of after-life. For the sake\\nof convenience I shall put my remarks under the orthodox\\nthree heads of tradition, taking, however, no great pains to\\navoid over-lappings. First, Should psychology be taught in\\nthe high-school? Secondly, With what end in view should it\\nbe taught? Thirdly, How should it be taught?\\nTo the first question, magnifying mine office, I return a\\ndogmatic yes. Aside from the fact that if I did not my paper\\nwould have to end right here, the following considerations\\nhave weight with me. No one, I suppose, would contend that\\neducation is complete until the one educated knows°some-thing\\nsomething of that intellect which has been receiving the training;\\nof those feelings which form the springs of his action, and of\\nthe will which has been exercising itself. No teacher, I am\\nsure, would contend that this knowledge of one\\'s own nature\\nis exhausted in the study of physiology, for no teacher,\\nwhatever his theoretical views, has ever been a practical\\nmaterialist. He comes into too close contact with the living\\npersonality for that. Indeed, I have often been struck with\\nthe way in which good teachers treat almost any°psychologi-cal\\npsychological subject, a way likely to be more adequate than it receives\\nat the hands of a professed psychologist. The reason I have\\nalways conceived to be that the teacher never loses sight of\\nthe concrete mind, the personal boy or girl; he recognizes\\nthat the laws and principles of the mental philosopher are\\nabstractions, and does not allow them to make him forget\\nthe individual who is in and through them all. So I am sure\\nthat I can count upon the hearty sympathy of every teacher\\nin laying considerable emphasis upon that knowledge of self\\nwhich it is the business of psychology to give.\\nBut why should systematic instruction in this line be\\ngiven in the high-school? When the respective claims of\\nlanguages, ancient and modern, mathematics and history,\\nscience, physical and biological, are driving distracted the\\n\\n ― 83 ―\\n                            \\nmuch-enduring Ulysses, there should be hesitation in laying\\non more load. In answer I should say that this study is\\nnecessary to meet a demand which arises in the child\\'s\\nnature about this time. No matter what one\\'s views about\\nthe relations of body and soul, one knows that the average\\nboy and girl undergo a mental as well as a physical°revolu-tion\\nrevolution between the ages of say, 14 to 17 years. There comes to\\nbe at this time something like self-consciousness. In a°cer-tain\\ncertain sense, no doubt, this commences when the child calls\\nhimself I, but after all this generally means that the child\\nrecognizes himself as one object among many. His own\\npeculiar individuality he does not become conscious of until\\nhe feels his relations to others, and this he does not do until\\nhis life finds its solidarity with that of the race. We may\\noften be struck with the apparent selfishness, cruelty and\\nheedlessness of children before this period, but we err unless\\nwe remember that this is of nature, rather than conscious.\\nThe child up to this time lives a natural life, a naïve,°objec-tive\\nobjective one. With adolescence begins his subjective existence;\\nthe life which recognizes its own unique significance for\\nitself, and begins dwelling upon its personal relations,°intel-lectual\\nintellectual and moral, and experimenting with them to get them\\nadjusted in that way in which about the whole life of man\\nconsists. These are the beginnings of self-questioning; of\\nintrospection; of inquiries into the meaning of things, and of\\none\\'s relation to them. Now it is a question of the widest\\npedagogic interest, what are we to do with this change in the\\nchild\\'s nature? Shall we recognize it in any systematic way,\\nor leave it to take care of itself? I do not mean for one\\nmoment to claim that the study of psychology is the all\\nsufficient means of meeting it; but it does seem possible that\\ndirecting the inquiries of the child at this time, instead of\\nallowing them to drift, may be an immediate intellectual\\nhelp as well as save much waste of mental and even moral\\nforce. But not only is psychology needed to meet the°dawn-ing\\ndawning self-consciousness of the student, but it is needed in\\norder to balance the relations of studies. Before adolescence\\nthe pupil\\'s mind does not, in the vast majority of cases, care\\nfor connection or relation. Isolated facts are enough. The\\nchild asks why, but any other fact does for the answer. After\\n\\n ― 84 ―\\n                            \\npuberty, the isolated facts seem to shoot together. The child\\nmust have his facts threaded upon some principle. Now I\\nmust not be understood as suggesting that the study of\\npsychology is the only or even the primary means of°answer-ing\\nanswering this want. Every subject the pupil studies should be\\ntreated in such a way as to answer this demand. But is there\\nnot something to be said for the view that the child should\\nbe led to see that these studies centre in his intelligence? It is\\nof some importance, it must be of great value ultimately,\\nthat the pupil be made to know that in studying°mathemat-ics\\nmathematics he is illustrating laws of his own reason; that in pursuing\\ngeology or botany he is exercising his own perceptive\\npowers; that in history and the languages he is becoming\\nacquainted with wills and intelligences like his own.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology ought to serve rather as a bond of union among\\nstudies than as a source of new discord. At all events, when\\na youth is studying everything in the world, from yeast to\\nelephants and from bugs to Greek roots, it cannot be out of\\nplace to call his attention to the fact that he himself exists\\nand is as worthy of study as any of these things.\\nAnd this suggests in the second place with what°pur-pose\\npurpose the study of psychology should be carried on. It should\\nbe studied with a view to putting greater meaning into the\\nrest of the curriculum. I should suggest this in connection\\nespecially with the studies of grammar, rhetoric and°litera-ture\\nliterature. Grammar is an exceedingly technical study. Its°com-prehension\\ncomprehension would ultimately lead us into the ranges of°meta-physics\\nmetaphysics, to say nothing of psychology. To the beginner it too\\noften seems an arbitrary collection of meaningless rules. But\\neven an elementary knowledge of the laws of the general\\nnotion and of judgment and the reasoning powers, would\\nenable the pupil to see in grammar a reflection of his own\\nintelligence, and I can but express my conviction that there\\nis no more efficient way of verifying and rendering fruitful a\\nstudy of English literature than to undertake it in connection\\nwith the study of psychology. A student who knows°some-thing\\nsomething of the imagination and its ways of working, of\\næsthetic feeling and its modes of expression, will certainly\\ntake a more intelligent interest in Shakespeare, Tennyson\\nand Carlyle than he otherwise would. Give an intelligent\\n\\n ― 85 ―\\n                            \\nyouth of 17 or 18 a novel of George Eliot\\'s to read critically;\\nwhat will be the difference in value of result according as he\\nknows or not something of the facts of human will, and of\\nsocial and moral feeling? I feel sure that a proper study of\\npsychology is capable of transforming the reading of°litera-ture\\nliterature from a pastime with incidental revenue of instruction\\ninto a sincere, critical and fruitful appreciation of it, so far\\nas extends the range of the student.\\nIt follows from what has been said that the instruction\\nin psychology should not have a dogmatic end in view—the\\ncommunication of a system. I say this not only because of\\nthe many varying opinions on some psychological subjects,\\nbut also because, even in matters where there may be no\\ndispute, the student is not in a condition to appreciate the\\ntruth. Neither his knowledge nor the maturity of his°intel-lect\\nintellect allows him to grapple with any very systematic°proposi-tions\\npropositions. There is a two-fold error in furnishing the pupil with\\nideas, even if true, when he is not in a condition to°appre-ciate\\nappreciate their origin and bearing. In the first place the chief\\nultimate end of the study of psychology is to gain a°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of one\\'s self. This must be a gradual process, and one\\nwhich can be carried on only by the student himself. To\\npresent him at the outset with a chart of himself, formulæ,\\nlabels, nomenclatures and analysis complete, is to do away\\nwith the only object of the study. It is to commit the error of\\ndepriving the student of his primary pedagogic right in re\\npsychology. The second aspect of the mistake is that it may\\nshut off the student from learning anything new. If a student\\nis thoroughly inoculated with a system, his growth in the\\nfuture is rendered difficult. The cartilaginous portions of the\\nbrain are hardened and its sutures closed. One who has been\\nintroduced when his mind is most plastic into a system of\\nhard and fast distinctions, cannot lose their impress. All new\\nfacts he can classify and comprehend only by their°connec-tion\\nconnection with his system. When a new fact appears he does not\\nassimilate it; he takes out his rule and his pigeon-holed box;\\nmeasures the fact according to his ready-made standard, and\\ntucks it away in its appropriate place.\\nThis suggests what is perhaps the chief end of the\\nstudy of psychology-the cultivation of openness and°flexibil-ity\\n ― 86 ―\\n                            \\nflexibility of mind. If I were asked what is the chief intellectual\\ndefect found in pupils, I should answer, judging from my\\nown experience, lack of flexibility, lack of ability to turn the\\nmind towards new ideas, or look at old ones in new lights.\\nThere is a helplessness towards what lies outside of the\\nwonted grooves of thought. While it is neither to be°ex-pected\\nexpected nor desired that students should exhibit precocious\\noriginality of conception, it is desirable that their minds\\nshould be hospitable and not alien to ideas. The mind does\\nnot need to create new lines in order to be able to move upon\\nthem when suggested. It is an important pedagogic point to\\nknow what can be done to make the intelligence of the\\naverage boy and girl more flexible-that is, better able to\\nhandle on its own account lines of thought upon which it has\\nnot been exercised. How can we make the mind, not more\\nmature, but more receptive to ideas; how can we cultivate,\\nnot a higher grade of intelligence, but spontaneity of action?\\nThese are the questions. The notion that the study of°psy-chology\\npsychology will aid in answering them, is because this study\\nrequires in such large measure the self-initiating,°self-direct-ing\\nself-directing movement of mind. The student\\'s mind is at once the\\nmaterial to be observed and the observer. It furnishes as well\\nthe method of observation. The student deals, not with a\\nmaterial foreign to himself, by which he may be hampered,\\nbut with himself. He must discover the very material of his\\nstudy. Nor can rules of discovery be externally laid down for\\nhim in routine methods to which he must conform. The\\nways of getting at the material and of treating it must be left\\nto himself. The teacher\\'s function must be largely one of\\nawakening, of stimulation. The mind of the average pupil\\nwill reject this awakening if it can, and will ask anything\\nrather than to be led out of the fields of authority into\\nintellectual regions where it is itself responsible for results.\\nBut the test of the teaching will after all be the degree in\\nwhich the mind is awakened and is given ability to act for\\nitself.\\nThis does not imply that the teacher is to be a°nonen-tity\\nnonentity, or that he is to give no positive instruction, or make\\nknown to the student none of the generalizations arrived at\\nby past psychological study. It means that the student must\\n\\n ― 87 ―\\n                            \\nbe led to reproduce and realize the material in himself. It is a\\ndemand similar to that made in behalf of the experimental\\nmethod in the physical sciences. The pupil must be made to\\nsee in concrete cases what his rules, etc., mean; and in the\\ncase of psychology, these concrete cases may be suggested\\nby the teacher, but they can actually be found only by the\\nstudent himself in his own mind. The result must be that if\\npsychology is so taught it will aid largely in helping on to\\nwhat is, when all is said and done, the end of education-the\\nsecuring of intellectual freedom, in its various factors of\\nopenness of mind, hospitality to ideas, and ability to move\\namong them unconstrainedly. I feel sure that if psychology\\ncould be taught in high-schools with this end in view, fewer\\nof our students in college would be monuments of blank and\\nbland helplessness when a new idea is presented than is now\\nthe case.\\nThis introduces us to our third question, how should\\npsychology be taught? The phrase, \"if properly taught,\"\\nhas been many times used, and it is no more than fair to ask\\nwhat is proper teaching. In reply I can only say it is such\\nteaching as serves the end mentioned, and whatever other\\nends are desirable. It must be the function of the individual\\nteacher, as it is his privilege, to lay down the especial acts\\nrequired, and to make his wise adaptation of means to end.\\nYet a few suggestions will perhaps be pardoned. I have\\nheard of a high-school where the teacher merely announces\\nat the end of one hour that the subject for the next day is\\nmemory, or feeling or whatever. He does not tell the pupils\\nanything about them; he does not tell them where they can\\nfind out about them. But the next day, by skillful°question-ing\\nquestioning, he draws out such ideas as he can from the pupil\\'s own\\nconsciousness. I can well believe that with a wise teacher,\\nand small classes, this hour is one of the most looked°for-ward\\nforward to, as well as one of the most profitable of the whole\\nday. The method has at all events the sanction of Socrates,\\nthe founder of scientific psychology.\\nBut the teacher must undoubtedly be on his guard not\\nto foster undue or morbid introspection. I think that the\\nstudy of psychology rightly handled will tend to check this\\nhabit with its evil results, for it will tend to make the\\n\\n ― 88 ―\\n                            \\nstudent\\'s feelings and ideas objective to himself; yet the\\nteacher must be a wise physician of the soul to secure proper\\nresults. An aid to this, without doubt, is keeping the study in\\nas close connection as possible with literature, as previously\\nsuggested. If the same teacher has charge of both studies,\\nwhy should it be impossible to take some literary classic,\\nand read it with especial attention to its psychological°fea-tures\\nfeatures—its treatment of perception, of imagination, of°discur-sive\\ndiscursive thought, of impulses, of choice, etc.? By such a method\\nthe student not only gains some idea of the scope and subject\\nmatter of psychology, but some idea of what constitutes\\nstyle, and the proper material and arrangement of literary\\nmaterial.\\nThe difficulty of giving any cast iron rules concerning\\nmethod, psychology shares with all studies; with the°addi-tional\\nadditional difficulty—and advantage-that it is above all a°per-sonal\\npersonal study. The only first rule which it is possible to lay\\ndown is that the teacher must come into the most intimate\\nrelations with the minds of the students. Upon this condition\\ndepends in reality the answer to the other questions: Should\\npsychology be taught, and with what end should it be\\ntaught? Unless it is met there is indeed no especial end to be\\ngained by the introduction of psychology into the°curricu-lum\\ncurriculum. The student would better confine his attention to the\\nstudies which he can absorb once for all, with no teacher\\nstanding between him and the light.\\nDiscussion\\n\\nProf. W. H. Payne said: I do not wish to enter upon\\nthe discussion of this subject at this time, and I fully agree\\nwith the sentiments of the paper that a share of the public\\nschool attention should be given to the study of mental\\nphenomena. There is, however, at this time a lack of books\\nadapted to such work and a lack of teachers prepared to give\\ninstruction in the subject. Before taking my seat I wish to\\nenter my protest against the idea which is now held in\\ncertain localities, that the young mind can only be\\nstrengthened by original investigation in any subject.°Cer-tain\\nCertain things have been already learned, and a pupil\\'s mind\\n\\n ― 89 ―\\n                            \\nmay grow by a study of facts that have been given to him.\\nWe are subject to certain periodic pressures in which one\\ntopic and then another is brought into prominence. A short\\ntime since, the sciences were in the ascendant, then the\\nstudy of English bid fair to over-balance all others, and now\\nwe have \"manual training\" claiming the ascendancy. The\\ntrue course, it would seem, is to give each subject due\\nconsideration, and not in the excitement of the moment\\nallow ourselves unduly to magnify any one thing.\\nProf. Montgomery said: Psychology should be taught\\nin the high-schools because so many of our teachers are\\nprepared there. If we knew more of the study of the mind\\nthere might be less of running to extremes.\\nPresident Hull said: As we now lack any elementary\\ntext-book of this kind, would it not be well to prepare a\\npamphlet which should contain the dialogues of Plato in\\nsuch form as to lead the high-school student to begin this\\nstudy?\\n\\n ― 90 ―\\n                            \\nThe Place of Religious Emotion [First published in the Monthly Bulletin, Students\\' Christian\\nAssociation, University of Michigan, VIII (Nov. 1886), 23-25.\\nNot previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThere is, if the phrase may receive pardon, such a thing as\\nreligious hygiene. There is a certain body of considerations\\nand precepts which avail in the practical ordering of°reli-gious\\nreligious life. They will not bring righteousness and peace to a\\ndiseased soul, any more than physiological rules will heal a\\ndisordered body. But they will help to keep it healthy, and to\\nmake it grow when once it is sound. I know of nothing more\\nimportant in the practical Christian life, than the right°con-duct\\nconduct of the emotions. They are so central that when they are\\nhealthy, we may take it for granted that the whole religious\\nlife is upon the right line. There are two unhealthy°develop-ments\\ndevelopments of emotion which occur to me in the consideration of\\nthis subject. One is deadness or apathy of feeling. The other\\nis undue or unregulated stimulation. It is certain as anything\\ncan be, that without a spontaneous and active interest in\\nthings that are lovely and of good report, there will be no\\nsincere devotion, no earnest service. An outgoing and°con-stant\\nconstant renewing of religious emotion is the only motive force\\nwhich will awaken us from drowsy torpor, from listless\\ndreaming, from an empty and purposeless life. It alone can\\ncall us out of the kingdom of drudgery and routine, and\\nintroduce us to the joy of the kingdom of God. This is a\\ntruth not confined to religious action. It is co-extensive with\\nall action. Without the interest supplied by emotions, men\\nmight sleep and dream, but they would never awake and act.\\nBut mark one thing—the feeling is not a good in itself, it is\\ngood because it does arouse, because it awakens aspiration,\\nkindles devotion, and leads to service.\\nAnd this suggests the fact that, while it is all important\\n\\n ― 91 ―\\n                            \\nto have the religious emotions alive and developed, it is\\nequally important that they should be healthy. But what is\\nunhealthy religious feeling? In the words of Dr. Martineau,\\nit is \"keenly watching the spiritual weather in the mind,\\ngauging the affections, refining the temperature, describing\\nthe clouds, but spell-bound in the personal atmosphere, and\\nnever carried out into the light of lights.\" Religious feeling\\nis unhealthy when it is watched and analyzed to see if it\\nexists, if it is right, if it is growing. It is as fatal to be\\nforever observing our own religious moods and experiences,\\nas it is to pull up a seed from the ground to see if it is\\ngrowing. We must plant the seed and nourish it, and leave\\nthe rest where it belongs—to God. God, in all reverence, has\\nno special interest in or concern for our own private feelings\\nand experiences. Religious feeling, when it is thought to\\nmean collection of thoughts and sentiments about God, or of\\ntender and solemn emotions in the mind, belies itself, and is\\nno longer religious. How many of us are making religion an\\noccasion for the production and observation of spiritual\\nweather in ourselves, and even of regarding God more as a\\nmeans for affording us certain religious emotions than as a\\nperson to whom the reverence and service of our lives is\\nmost humbly due? So far as feeling is regarded simply as a\\nstate of our own selves, and is interesting to us simply as an\\nexperience, as an occasion for remorse on our deadness or\\nfor self-gratulation on our quickness, it does more than fail\\nin being religious: it is irreligious; for it keeps us shut up in\\nour poor and paltry being, while the essence of religion is\\nhumble self-surrender of our wills to the Divine will. We\\nmay flatter ourselves that we are living an advanced°Chris-tian\\nChristian life, and produce feelings of tenderness and of°aspira-tion\\naspiration, of regret and of disease as evidences of this life; and yet\\nthese feelings, rightly interpreted, may only show that we\\nare turning round and round in the paddock of our own\\nselfishness, never having lost our lives in the one perfect life.\\nIn such cases, every additional emotion, though it be called\\nreligion, is additional evidence that we have no part nor lot\\nin religion. Healthy emotion, whether religious or otherwise,\\nis that which finds no time nor opportunity to dwell upon\\nitself and see how it is getting along; which loses itself in\\n\\n ― 92 ―\\n                            \\npushing on to the work of the prize of the high calling. It is\\nemotion which expends itself in action, and which gives the\\nimpetus to new endeavor.\\nBut we must cultivate our religious emotions; and how\\nshall we do this and yet avoid the error just mentioned? By\\nthinking more of God and His will and less of ourselves; by\\nregarding religion more and our own progress in religion\\nless. If we cultivate humility in the presence of the perfect\\nand matchless character of Christ, we shall find that regret\\nand remorse for our own shortcomings will come quickly\\nenough without our going to pump them up artificially; if\\nwe cultivate reverence for that perfect and living will of God\\nas made known to us in Christ, we shall find little need and\\nless opportunity for looking after our own spiritual weather,\\nand seeing that we are enjoying the proper amount of light,\\nand experiencing the sufficient need of heat. The light which\\nis of God will shine upon us, and the heat which comes of\\ndevoted service will be ours.\\n\\n ― 93 ―\\n                            \\nSoul and Body [First published in Bibliotheca Sacra, XLIII (Apr. 1886), 239-63.\\nNot previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nLest the reader trained in a school which holds that there is\\nnothing to be said of the relations of soul and body, except\\nthat there is soul and there is body and that is the end of it,\\nshould turn away at the outset in disgust from what must\\nseem to him an attempt to solve the insoluble-let me say a\\nword or two to avoid misapprehension. Lotze has°some-where\\nsomewhere called attention to the fact that the natural tendency\\nof an historical age, priding itself on its historical sense, and\\nworking by an historical method, is to surrender the°under-standing\\nunderstanding to the imagination, and to demand pictures instead\\nof principles. We are not contented until we can see the\\nobject-matter as a series of definite images. Instead of°ex-planation\\nexplanation we want a drama before our eyes. It is because of\\nthis tendency, I believe, that it is assumed that there is some\\ndifficulty special in kind surrounding the question of the\\nrelations of soul and body which makes all attempts to\\nconsider the subject necessarily futile. It seems to be°as-sumed\\nassumed on the one hand that nothing can be said about it\\nunless we can see into the bowels of the molecules°constitut-ing\\nconstituting the brain, and behold from their mutual attractions and\\nrepulsions, a sensation and a thought engendered. Or on the\\nother hand, it is assumed that to know any thing about the\\nrelations of soul and body, we must be able to contemplate\\nthe soul, seated as on a throne in the body, thence sending\\nforth her messengers to lay hold of the nerves and cause\\nthem to bring her reports of what is going on in the outlying\\nregions of her domain, or to execute her orders among\\nrefractory subjects. And if the only way of knowing any\\nthing about their relations were some such imaginative°ex-ploit\\nexploit, the question were well called insoluble. But questions,\\n\\n ― 94 ―\\n                            \\nas science and philosophy can well testify, are more often\\ninsoluble by reason of some unnecessary and absurd°as-sumption\\nassumption, than from the inherent nature of the case. And so\\nthe failure of all attempts on this line is rather, I conceive,\\ntestimony to the absurdity of the mode of search, than to the\\nabsurdity of the question itself. We have an understanding\\nas well as an imagination; principles may be thought as well\\nas pictures seen; laws exist as well as panoramas. We may\\nwell give up the attempt to imagine the neural and psychical\\nprocesses so as to see a transition from one to another, and\\nconfine ourselves to the less picturesque, but more hopeful,\\ntask of inquiring what principles shall be employed in order\\nto render intelligible the relations of the physical and°psychi-cal\\npsychical, so far as these relations have been actually made known.\\nWe have certain facts declared by physiology and°psychol-ogy\\npsychology. The sole question is: what principles, conceptions,\\nshall we use in order to explain these facts, i.e., in order to\\nrender a consistent, intelligible account of them? To say that\\nthis cannot be done is simply to say that there are facts in\\nthe universe which are utterly irrational, which have no\\nmeaning. And the one who has the capacity of discovering\\nby his reason that certain facts are non-rational to his°rea-son\\nreason, is not the one whom I address.\\nTherefore, if it is again stated that the object of this\\npaper is to consider the relations of soul and body, I hope it\\nwill be understood that the object is not to get into the inside\\nof nature and behold with mortal eyes what is going on\\nthere, but the less ambitious one of inquiring what°princi-ples\\nprinciples must be used in order to give meaning to the facts of the\\ncase. How shall the facts of physiological psychology be\\ninterpreted?\\nWhat are these facts?\\nFirst. The nervous system, complex as it is, consists\\nultimately of fibres and cells. The fibres serve normally to\\nconduct or transfer nervous stimuli either from the organ of\\nsense to some collection of cells, or ganglion, or from this\\ncentre back to the muscles and glands, or from one such\\ncentre to another. The cells, on the other hand, receive the\\nstimuli brought to them from the surface, and react upon\\nthem in such a way as either to neutralize them from their\\nown supply of force, or so as to set free their own nervous\\n\\n ― 95 ―\\n                            \\nenergy. In short, the fibres conduct the nervous energy; the\\ncells produce it and regulate its distribution. This distinction\\nin the mode of work of the two elements exists. But it has\\nbeen usual to regard this distinction in such a way as to\\nmake of it an actual separation of functions. This introduces\\na dualism into the action of the nervous system at the start.\\nIt has been held that the fibres are purely passive and\\nreceptive, while cells are active. This leads to this result: the\\ncells alone are regarded as having psychical bearings, so\\nthat the brain is held to be the sole organ of the mind. The\\nnerves and the peripheral organs are eliminated. Some even\\ngo so far as to hold that in the brain there must be some\\nparticular set of cells to which all stimuli must be°con-ducted\\nconducted, and that this alone is the organ of the soul. We must\\navoid, at the outset, any such error. The truth is that the\\ndistinction between fibre and cell is a relative one. Fibres\\npossess an activity of their own as well as the cells, and cells\\nconduct. The fibre is not a string which, pulled at one end,\\nrings a bell at the other, itself remaining the meantime\\nindifferent to the process; it is a series of nervous elements\\neach reacting upon the stimulus of the one before it, as the\\ncell reacts to the whole, and each passing it on to the one\\nafter it, as the cell distributes its energy. It is, in effect, a\\nconnected series of cells. What makes it behave differently\\nfrom the cell proper is the fact that its power of resistance is\\nso small, and its stored up energy relatively so slight. The\\ncell, on the other hand, is something more than an explosive;\\nit is a conductor. As there is no difference, chemically,\\nbetween the firing of a gunpowder train and the resulting\\nexplosion of the magazine, so there is none, physiologically,\\nbetween the processes of the nerve and cell. The difference\\nof the result in both cases is due partly to the amount of\\nenergy at hand to be set free, and still more to the resistance\\noffered. In the cell there are no tracks laid down for the\\ncarrying off of the energy introduced. It meets resistance,\\nfriction, and accumulates till either the cell energy inhibits\\nthat introduced, or reacts upon it so as to increase it, and\\nsend it forth through the nerve.  This is not theory, but physiological fact. The experimental data\\nwith the conclusions warranted will be found set forth in Wundt,\\nMechanik der Nerven, ^and Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie,\\nvol. i, pp. 240-64.\\n»1\\n ― 96 ―\\n                            \\nI may seem to have dwelt needlessly upon so simple a\\npoint, but it is the foundation of any further approach to a\\ncorrect theory of psycho-physiological relations. The°conclu-sion\\nconclusion which it warrants in this respect is all important. In\\nbrief it is this: The psychical is homogeneously related to\\nthe physiological. Whatever is the relation of the psychical\\nto the neural, it is related in the same manner to all parts of\\nthe neural. The brain is no more the organ of mind than the\\nspinal cord, the spinal cord no more than the peripheral\\nendings of the nerve fibres. The brain is undoubtedly most\\nclosely and most influentially connected with the life of the\\nsoul, but its connection is of the same kind as that of every\\nother part of the nervous system. Now this gives us but one\\nalternative: either there is absolutely no connection between\\nthe body and soul at any point whatever, or else the soul is,\\nthrough the nerves, present to all the body. This means that\\nthe psychical is immanent in the physical. To deny this is to\\ngo back to the Cartesian position, and make a miracle of the\\nwhole matter—to call in some utterly foreign power to make\\nthe transition which is actually found. This may cater to our\\nlove of pictures, but it is out of the line which we have laid\\ndown for ourselves. The nineteenth century substitute of a\\ndouble-faced substance is only another excursion into the\\nland of fancy sketches. It makes the imagination the source\\nof an ontology. But it fares even worse than the Cartesian\\nscheme. A double-faced substance not only refuses to be\\nthought, but, if one is in earnest, refuses to be imagined. It\\nis the result of the decrepitude of the imagination as well as\\nof the laziness of thought. Not colors for the imagination to\\nsee, but principles for the understanding to think, is the\\ndesideratum. That compromise which seemed to think that\\nthe problem of the relations of soul and body was simplified\\nif the connection of the two could be reduced to as small a\\nspace as possible, and excluded it first from the fibre, then\\nfrom the spinal cord, then from the basal ganglia, the°cere-bellum\\ncerebellum, all of the cerebrum except the cortex, then possibly\\none point of the cortex,—that, too, must be abandoned. The\\nfact is, that the action of the nervous tissue is the same in\\nkind in the cortex and in the peripheral fibre, and hence if\\nany part of the nervous system has any connection with the\\n\\n ― 97 ―\\n                            \\nsoul which is not supernatural in character, every part must\\nhave, in kind, the same. All, or none, is the disjunction\\nforced upon us. The immanence of the psychical in the\\nphysical is, therefore, the foundation of our future inquiry.\\nThe nature of the immanence must now be inquired into.\\nThat there is unity of function in the cell and fibre is\\nestablished. What this function is and what conclusion it\\nwarrants are the questions now to be asked.\\nSecond. The fundamental nervous activity is a process\\nof adjustment, consisting in a twofold contemporaneous\\nprocess of stimulation and reaction or inhibition. If we turn\\nto the same physiological authorities whence we learned of\\nthe homogeneous nature of the action of fibre and cell, we\\nshall learn what this action is. Nervous tissue, in the first\\nplace, wherever found is a highly unstable chemical°com-pound\\ncompound. Any excitation tends to set up such chemical change\\nas will reduce it to relatively simpler and more stable°com-pounds\\ncompounds. There is thus set free an amount of energy°equiva-lent\\nequivalent to the amount which would be required to lift this lower\\ncompound up to its higher state again. The potential energy\\nof the unstable compound has, in short, become kinetic. The\\nfirst element in nervous action is, therefore, the excitatory or\\nstimulating, which has the setting free of nervous energy for\\nits result. But if this were all, the energy of the nervous\\nsystem would be soon used up. Every stimulus would set\\nfree nervous force, and the result would be that the body\\nwould respond to every stimulus, however slight, and the\\nprocess would end only with the complete exhaustion of the\\npower. We would be physically in the condition of those\\nhaving the Saint Vitus\\'s dance; mentally, in the state of\\nsome of the insane, who, having no reserve power, react\\nviolently upon every impression, intellectual or emotional,\\nuntil they sink into a stupor, out of which they come only to\\nrepeat the process. In short, there must be something which\\ngives control, which regulates the reaction, and which also\\nensures a reserve power. There must be opposed to the\\nexciting activity one which resists, and thereby prevents the\\nwhole force at hand, the whole unstable compound, from\\nbeing used, and which also restores it as it is expended. And\\nso it is found that there is a complementary process. Not\\n\\n ― 98 ―\\n                            \\nonly is energy being constantly put forth, but energy is\\nbeing constantly stored up or rendered latent. Not all the\\nforce which comes to a nervous element is employed in\\nbreaking down the unstable compounds and thereby losing\\nenergy; part—in some cases much the greater part—is used\\nin building up these unstable compounds, thereby forming a\\nreservoir of energy for future use, while the process itself\\nacts as a restraint upon, a control over, the excitatory factor.\\nEvery nervous action is, therefore, a reciprocal function of\\nstimulation, excitation, and inhibition; control through°re-pression\\nrepression. Every nervous activity is essentially an°adjust-ment\\nadjustment. It is called forth through the stimulus, but the°stimu-lus\\nstimulus is not the sole factor; it does not wander at its own sweet\\nwill, but is checked and directed by the reacting activity, the\\ninhibiting. This is true, of course, of every process, whether\\noccurring in fibre or in cell; but because of the structural\\ndifferences between the two, previously spoken of, the°for-mer\\nformer mode of action greatly predominates over the other in\\nthe fibre; while in the cell the inhibitory activity exceeds at\\nthe expense of the stimulating. Since the fibres correspond,\\nin a general way, to the peripheral nerve system and the\\ncells to the central, it may truly enough be said that the\\nstimulating or exciting is the peripheral, and the reacting\\nand controlling is the central or ganglionic.\\nLooked at from this point of view, the unitary nervous\\nactivity is evidently that known as reflex action. In that, we\\nhave precisely these relations of excitement on the one hand,\\nand adjusting activity on the other, of which we have just\\nbeen speaking. Our conclusions are as follows: there is a\\nfundamental mode of nervous activity; in this the psychical is\\nimmanent. This mode of activity is an adjusting activity;\\ntherefore the psychical is immanent in the physical as°di-recting\\ndirecting it toward a given end. It is not only immanent, but it\\nis teleologically immanent. This teleological character is\\nseen in the nature of the function itself as just described.\\nThe loss of the proper proportion of the stimulating and the\\ninhibiting activity is a token of morbid disorder. It is°patho-logical\\npathological. If the centres react on feeble stimuli, they squander\\ntheir force upon the little stimuli, which are constant, by\\nplaying upon them; if they react only upon very strong\\n\\n ― 99 ―\\n                            \\nstimuli, the force they contain is never put forth when\\nneeded to perform the proper adjustment of the organism.\\nBut in normal life we find that exact proportion between the\\ntwo activities which ensures that the force shall be used\\nwhen its expenditure is for the good of the organism, and\\nthen alone. If we take the simplest case of nervous action,\\nsuch a one as occurs in a cold-blooded animal deprived of all\\nits nervous apparatus except the spinal cord, it will only\\nrender still more distinct the teleological character as°objec-tively\\nobjectively manifested. Read the following account of Wundt:\\n\"A decapitated frog moves its legs against the pincers\\nwith which it is irritated, or it wipes away with its foot the\\ndrop of acid applied to the skin. It sometimes tries to get\\naway from a mechanical or electrical stimulation by a jump.\\nIf put into an unusual position (e.g., on its back) it often\\nreturns to its normal position. The stimulus does not°intro-duce\\nintroduce merely a motion in general, which spreads from the\\nirritated part with increasing intensity of the stimulus and\\ngrowing irritability, but the movement is adapted to the\\nexternal impression. It may be a movement of defence, or\\none to get rid of the stimulus, or a movement to remove the\\nbody from the sphere of irritation, or finally it may aim at\\nrestoration of the previous posture. This purposive°adapta-tion\\nadaptation to the stimulus stands out even more clearly in°experi-ments\\nexperiments by Pflüger and Auerbach in which the ordinary°condi-tions\\nconditions of movement are somewhat changed. A frog, for°exam-ple\\nexample, whose leg has been cut off on the side on which it is\\nirritated by acid, first makes some fruitless attempts with\\nthe amputated stump, and then, pretty regularly, chooses\\nthe other leg, which is wont to remain at rest when the\\nanimal is unmutilated. If the decapitated frog be fastened by\\nits back, and the inner side of one of its thighs be sprinkled\\nwith acid, it tries to get rid of the latter by rubbing the two\\nthighs against each other; but if the moved thigh be°sepa-rated\\nseparated far from the other, after a few vain attempts it°sud-denly\\nsuddenly stretches this one out, and pretty accurately reaches\\nthe point which was irritated. Lastly, if one breaks the\\nupper thighs of decapitated frogs and cauterizes, whilst they\\nare stretched on their bellies the lower part of their backs,\\nthey correctly touch the cauterized spot with the feet of the\\n\\n ― 100 ―\\n                            \\nbroken limb, in spite of the disturbing nature of the°treat-ment\\ntreatment. These observations, which may be varied in diverse\\nways, show that the animal can adapt its movements to its\\nchanged conditions.\" (Wundt, Grundzüge, vol. ii, p.\\n404.)\\nOf course what is true of this simplest form of nerve\\naction is still more true of the higher forms, until we have a\\nlarge number of nerve centres acting co-ordinately with\\neach other, and all subordinated to the execution of a given\\nact recognized as necessary for the preservation or°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of the organism. But it is enough for our purpose to\\ntake our stand upon this elementary form of reflex action,\\nand thus cut the very standing ground from under the feet of\\nthe materialist.\\nThis, then, is our conclusion: the psychical is°imma-nent\\nimmanent in the physical; immanent as directing it toward an\\nend, and for the sake of this end selecting some activities,\\ninhibiting others, responding to some, controlling others,\\nand adjusting and co-ordinating the complex whole, so as, in\\nthe simplest and least wasteful way, to reach the chosen end.\\nWe find, therefore, that in the simplest form of nervous\\naction there are involved categories transcending the°mate-rial\\nmaterial; principles to which matter, as such, is an entire\\nstranger. Matter per se knows no higher category than that\\nof physical causality. Its highest law is that of the necessities\\nof antecedent and consequent. In nervous action we find the\\ncategory of teleology. The act is not determined by its\\nimmediate antecedents, but by the necessary end. We have\\ngone from the sphere of physical to that of final causation,\\nand thereby we recognize that we have gone from the purely\\nphysical to the immanence of the psychical in the physical,\\ndirecting the latter for its own end and purpose.\\nThe materialist, with his reversed logic, which°at-tempts\\nattempts to get the higher from the lower, instead of°account-ing\\naccounting for the lower on the ground of the higher, utterly misses\\nthe nature of the case. To him, the fact of reflex action, the\\nfact of purposive adjustment (if he be far enough advanced\\nin the elements to recognize the fact at all) is evidence of the\\nself-sufficiency of matter. He forthwith makes teleological\\naction an attribute of matter, and intelligent purposiveness a\\n\\n ― 101 ―\\n                            \\nfunction of the material. He does not recognize that in doing\\nthis he is giving up all that characterizes matter as matter,\\nand is, in effect, recognizing the primacy of spirit. If°teleol-ogy\\nteleology belong to the essence of matter, and purposive regulated\\naction be the nature of the material, then matter and°mate-rial\\nmaterial cease to be what they are commonly regarded as being\\n(viz., matter and material), and become but the hiding\\nplaces (which are the dwelling places) of spirit and the\\npsychical. The dispute is not, I suppose, about what words\\nwe shall use, but what principles. Nor is the question, again,\\nabout pictures, but about laws of explanation. If we cease to\\nform a verbal or pictorial conception of matter we shall find\\nthat for scientific purposes it means the principle of physical\\ncausation; the constant and invariable relations of°anteced-ent\\nantecedent and consequent. To attempt to get more into the°con-ception\\nconception of matter is unscientific in that it is unwarranted;\\nand unscientific in that, if it were accomplished, it would\\ndestroy the basis of all physical science and leave it the field\\nfor the play of imaginative fancies by whose side the highest\\nflight of the science of the Greek, or of the Middle Ages,\\nwill sink into insignificance. The recognition of this one\\nprinciple of physical causation, the invariableness of°succes-sion\\nsuccession, is the theoretic basis of all physical science. To attempt\\nto include more is to destroy the principle without reason,\\nand to introduce unbounded confusion. Some foregleams of\\nthe depths of absurdity to which we may reach, once started\\non this course of surrendering principles to words or images,\\nmay be seen in the efforts of some German materialists,\\nwho, in their laudable efforts to be consistent, have found it\\nnecessary to supply the primordial atoms with sensations,\\nand who hold that the laws of the universe are to be deduced\\nfrom their primitive loves and hates, their desires and°striv-ings\\nstrivings. Such is the only consistent position for a materialist.\\nBut it is a consistency which looks marvellously like a°reduc-tio\\nreductio ad absurdum. And it is suicide as well, for it is to give up\\nthe very essence of the materialistic position, and to admit\\nthat the nature and laws of the material are constituted by\\nthe psychical, which is the determining and prior element in\\nthe case. To attempt to swallow up the psychical in the\\nmaterial is not only absurd, but it is useless, for the°psychi-cal\\n ― 102 ―\\n                            \\npsychical always revenges itself by encroaching upon the material,\\nand when we finally look for some independent speck of\\nmatter, there is none there. It has all been spiritualized. Or,\\nif there be one speck there, it must be defined in terms of the\\nconception of matter just laid down. It will be found to be\\nmatter because it acts according to the principles of physical\\ncausation and not of final causation; because it is determined\\nby its antecedent, not by an end working itself out in it. So\\nthat after all there is no choice for the materialist. If he will\\nbut once open his eyes to the fact of purposive action he has\\nno alternative. He may attempt to claim this function as an\\nattribute of matter; if he does, as just seen, he dematerializes\\nhis matter. He may admit that there is matter whose°princi-ple\\nprinciple and law is that of psychical causation. He will then\\nrecognize that whatever transcends this principle is°essen-tially\\nessentially non-material, and that with the appearance of°teleolog-ical\\nteleological action upon the scene, we have passed from the realm of\\nthe material into that of the psychical immanent in the\\nmaterial. This is rational, and this saves science from°be-coming\\nbecoming the sport of every inflated and ill-balanced\\nimagination.\\nThere is another method of escaping the significance of\\npurposive action, equally futile, but equally attractive to the\\nmind that prefers panoramas to principles. It is, at present,\\nthe more fashionable method. In brief, it is to admit that the\\nactions are at present teleological, but that they became such\\nthrough a long series of accidental experiments°(experi-ments\\n(experiments which were not experiments, as they were not trying\\nto reach any end) of which some happened to be°advanta-geous\\nadvantageous to the organism, and, surviving, give us now the\\nappearance of purpose. This theory attempts to make the\\nteleological an accidental product of the mechanical. It°gen-erally\\ngenerally hides itself behind imposing scientific terms connected\\nwith the theory of biological evolution. It uses its°\"varia-tions\\n\"variations\" and \"selection,\" and \"survival of the fittest\" and\\n\"heredity,\" and thinks that in the end it has got something\\nout of nothing—purpose out of accident. But the argument is\\nsuicidal. It only changes the special case into a general law.\\nIt gets rid of the primitive purposiveness of, say, a given\\nreflex act, only by importing purposiveness, and thus°intel-ligence\\n ― 103 ―\\n                            \\nintelligence, into the very structure of nature. It simply says that\\nnature is such that, by the observance of its own laws as\\nascertained by science, it gives rise to action for and by ends.\\nVariation, selection, heredity, as names, do not, I suppose,\\naccomplish the result. It is that there are embedded in the\\nvery constitution of things, forces and principles which as\\nthey work themselves out, by their action and reaction, give\\nrise to activity for an end, to purposive action. In short, not\\nonly is the structure of the nervous system such that it gives\\nrise to teleological action, but the structure of nature itself is\\nsuch that it gives rise to this special kind of purposive\\naction. He who has thought to get rid of teleology, and\\nthereby intelligence, in this special case, has done it only by\\nthe recognition of teleology, and thereby intelligence, as a\\nuniversal principle and acting force. Darwinism, far from\\noverthrowing this principle, merely establishes it as a°gen-eral\\ngeneral law of the universe, of the structure of things. Nature is\\nmade teleological all the way through.\\nFrom this digression, which has, I hope, developed the\\nargument, as well as secured it from possible misconception,\\nI return to the conclusion. The psychical is teleologically\\nimmanent in the physical. The simplest nerve action is not\\nso simple as to exclude the adaptive, purposive factor. It is\\nalways an adjustment. It is never a mere mechanical result\\nof a stimulus, but always involves selection, inhibition, and\\nresponse. The stimulus favorable to the well-being of the\\norganism is selected from the immense number playing\\nupon the organism; others, especially those unserviceable,\\nare inhibited, and then the action results according to the\\nneeds, that is, the purpose, of the organism itself. If we\\nbroaden our view and take in the consentaneous action of the\\nwhole organism, the conclusion appears only the more\\nclearly. The various sensory and muscular stimuli, almost\\ninfinite in number, are always co-ordinated and°harmoni-ously\\nharmoniously combined. The nerves of the cord, the cord itself, the\\nspecial sense nerves, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, the\\ncerebral hemispheres, with their infinitude of fibres and\\ncells, act as an adjusted unity for one purpose, and one alone\\n—the welfare of the organism. At times it may seem as if one\\npart were functioning alone, but it is always found (unless\\n\\n ― 104 ―\\n                            \\nthe action be pathological) that it is a relative independence.\\nThe end of the organism is best gained by allowing a certain\\namount of originative and self-executed action by the°partic-ular\\nparticular part. The apparent independence is but the evidence of\\nthe thoroughly teleological character of the whole. It°signi-fies\\nsignifies the division of labor in order that the whole task, the\\ndevelopment of the organism, may be the more speedily and\\neconomically effected. There is no communistic level, but\\nthe due gradation and subordination of the various factors in\\nthe unity of the whole, as in a well-organized society. There\\nis, in short, the co-ordination of all the nerve organs, and the\\nfurther subordination of all to the end of the whole, self-\\nrealization.\\nSuch is the conclusion we arrive at, without leaving the\\npurely physiological sphere. But such a conclusion is one-\\nsided and narrow, until expanded to take in all the°phenom-ena\\nphenomena. The body, through the nervous system, is not only a\\nphysiological, but a psycho-physiological organism.°Ex-pressed\\nExpressed in its lowest terms, there is sensation, as well as\\nadjustment of all the activities to one end. Those who have\\nasserted the spirituality of the soul have often begun to build\\ntoo high. They have taken as their fortress abstract thought,\\nor the free-will. Now these offer, indeed, an impregnable\\nrefuge, but, in opening the campaign from there, ground is\\nabandoned which, by all territorial rights, is the eminent\\ndomain of the spiritual soul. To return to the former°meta-phor\\nmetaphor, we can finally build higher and more firmly, because\\non a broader foundation, on the basis of sensation. Too often\\nis the claim of the materialist that sensation, at least, can be\\naccounted for by material processes, admitted explicitly or\\ntacitly. It seems to be thought that because the immediate\\nand close connection of sensations with the nerve organs and\\nthe brain can be made out, that thereby their material°char-acter\\ncharacter is established. At bottom, this is the survival of a\\nmetaphor, out of date at its very birth. The mischief that the\\nterm \"impression\" has played with psychology can never be\\nmeasured. One of the greatest claims which physiological\\npsychology has upon us is that it has forever outlawed the\\nterm and the conception. The only word which has any place\\nin psychology as expressing the material antecedent of the\\n\\n ― 105 ―\\n                            \\npsychical state, sensation, is stimulus. Our°semi-material-ists\\nsemi-materialists, like Mr. Huxley and Mr. Tyndall, always conclude\\ntheir baldest assertions of the dependence of the mind upon\\nthe brain with some such statement as this: The passage\\nfrom the physics of the brain, from a nervous irritation,\\nfrom a change of motion and matter, to a fact of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, to a psychical state, to a sensation, is unthinkable, is an\\ninexplicable mystery, a gulf which imagination cannot span;\\nand so on, ad libitum. One would think that if they would\\ncease attempting to picture the transition and endeavor to\\nthink it, the explanation would be so patent as to stare them\\nfairly out of countenance. The \"mystery\" would explode in\\nits own fatuous vacuity. The unthinkable arises from the use\\nof wrong categories, wrong principles. No better evidence\\nthat the physical and the psychical are not related as cause\\nand effect, as producer and product, could be adduced than\\nthe utter \"mysteriousness\" hanging with \"inexplicable\"\\npersistence over all attempts to get one out of the other.\\nWhen it is recognized that \"inexplicability\" is not an°ulti-mate\\nultimate fact to be supremely contented with, but a positive\\ncondemnation of the method and principles which have led\\nto it, our scientific men will reflect twice before they thrust\\ntheir uncomprehended physical categories into the psychical\\nrealm, thereby begging the whole question, and, themselves\\nbeing witnesses, landing the whole affair in a mystery which\\ncannot be discriminated from an absurdity. It was°recog-nized\\nrecognized some hundreds of years ago that in geometry a°reduc-tio\\nreductio ad absurdum is a perfect and beautiful demonstration of\\nthe untruth of the original hypothesis. Let us hope that the\\nidea of the unity of all thought will finally dawn upon the\\nscientific men who have taken the contract of philosophizing\\nfor the English-speaking portion of the nineteenth century,\\nand that they will recognize that what holds in the basis of\\nall scientific reasoning holds also in the rudiments of\\nphilosophical.\\nWe will abandon, then, all attempts to picture the\\nconfessedly unimaginable, and those endeavors to explain\\nwhich lead us into the confessedly inexplicable. We will\\nbegin with the facts, and inquire what principle they force\\nupon us to explain them; we will not begin with a principle,\\n\\n ― 106 ―\\n                            \\nand, after having in nine-tenths of the paper victoriously\\n\"explained\" all facts by it, wind up with confessing that it is\\nall inexplicable, and accordingly go on to revel in the°unut-terable\\nunutterable bathos of the \"mysterious.\" If we take the facts, they\\nare simply these: (1) the constant sequence upon a certain\\nnervous process of a psychical state known as a sensation;\\n(2) the entire lack of any connection between the two by\\nway of physical causation, i.e., by way of identity of matter\\nand motion involved. The principle which this leads us to is\\nthat the physical antecedent is a stimulus necessary for the\\nproduction of a sensation; and that it is only a stimulus. The\\nsensation does not come from it, although it would never\\ncome without it. The sensation has its occasion from the\\nnervous process; it has its cause from within. The physical\\nprocess awakens the mind, it incites it to action; the mind,\\nthereupon, spontaneously and by its own laws develops from\\nitself a sensation. The specific names given to the various\\nfactors involved is of no importance, as long as it is°recog-nized\\nrecognized that the principle concerned is that of stimulus and\\nresponse; response, which, for its existence, depends upon\\nthe physical antecedent, but for its content and nature, upon\\nsomething else. We must recognize that we have got to go\\nbeyond the principle of physical causation to the principle of\\nself-developing activity, though an activity which is not\\ninfinite or self-produced, but dependent upon an occasioning\\nimpulse beyond it. In short, not only is the soul immanent in\\nthe body, as teleological, as subordinating and adjusting its\\nvarious activities to an end, but the body is the stimulus to\\nthe soul. It is the condition of the calling forth of its°activi-ties\\nactivities. It is the spark which fires the mind to light its own\\ninextinguishable flame. Sensation, and, a fortiori, all higher\\npsychical activities, testify to the creative, self-determining\\npower of the mind, with the proviso attached that this power\\nhas been called upon to act. There is just the same mystery\\nabout it that there is about every fact in the universe, the\\nmystery that there should be such a fact at all. As to°princi-ples\\nprinciples involved, there is no more mystery than in the°explana-tion\\nexplanation of any physical or chemical fact. In ultimate analysis,\\nthe spiritual principle is less mysterious, is lucidly°transpar-ent\\ntransparent in comparison with the mechanical; for it is only from\\n\\n ― 107 ―\\n                            \\nthe former that the latter gets its explanation and the°guar-antee\\nguarantee of its validity.\\nIf we include within our survey the°psycho-physiologi-cal\\npsycho-physiological facts as well as the purely physiological phenomena of\\nnerve action, we come to the conclusion that the soul not\\nonly directs and focuses the activities of the organism, but\\nthat it transforms them into something which they are not.\\nIt realizes itself upon the hints, as it were, given by the\\nbody. The soul is not only immanent in the body, as°consti-tuting\\nconstituting its unity and end; it is transcendent to it, as°trans-forming\\ntransforming its activities for its own psychical ends. It uses it as\\nmaterial out of which to build its own structure, as food by\\nwhich to nourish its own life. These two principles, of the\\nimmanence and the transcendence of the soul, to which we\\nhave been led by the study of the facts, cannot be left in this\\nisolated way. They must be shown in their unity as°necessar-ily\\nnecessarily involving each other. And again we turn to the facts of\\npsycho-physiological life with the assurance that the°princi-ple\\nprinciple will be involved in them, and that we are not left to the\\nlogical manipulation of our conceptions.\\nThey are the facts connected with the execution of\\ndefinite psycho-physiological functions. They may all be\\nincluded under the phrase \"localization of functions,\" if the\\nphrase be understood in a broad sense to mean the°perform-ance\\nperformance of any definite act of psychical bearings by any specific,\\norganized portion of the body. It would include, therefore,\\nthe performance of reflex acts by the spinal cord, as well as\\nthe supposed location of the \"speech centre\" in the third\\nfrontal convolution of the central hemisphere. The ground\\nfor this extension of the term is the unity of all nervous\\naction, as well as particular facts to be presently mentioned.\\nThe only difference between the regular and constant°\"local-ization\\n\"localization\" of reflex action in the spinal cord, and of speech in\\none part of the brain, is a difference of degree, not of kind.\\nThe difference is between a localization perfectly formed,\\nand a localization in process of forming. Organization of\\nfunction might be the better term.\\nIf we turn again to our authorities we shall find the\\nfacts substantially as follows:\\n1. In some form or other localization or, to use the\\n\\n ― 108 ―\\n                            \\nbetter term, organization of psychical function, is all but\\nuniversal. The body is not a homogeneous mass which is\\nindifferent, equally as a whole and in all its parts, to the\\nsoul. On the contrary, neither as a whole, nor in any of its\\nparts, is it neutral to the soul. That it is not as a whole, we\\nhave seen when considering the immanence of the soul in the\\nbody; that it is not in any of its parts, is simply a detailed\\napplication of the same principle. The soul is not only in the\\nbody, but it is in it in definite, particular ways. The body as\\na whole is not only the organ of the soul, but the various\\nstructures of the body are differentiated organs, of various\\ncapacities and tendencies, of the soul. That is the meaning\\nof the localization of function, or of the fact that certain\\nactivities have certain, more or less defined, nervous centres\\nin various portions of the spinal cord and brain.\\nTo give the specific evidence of this localization would\\nbe but to repeat the whole of the morphology and physiology\\nof the nervous system. The nervous system itself is but a\\ndifferentiation of the ectoderm; the special sense-organs are\\nonly so many continuations of the brain and spinal cord. If\\nwe take the various movements, we find that, in going from\\nthe simplest to the most complex, from the mere reflex\\naction to the most consciously purposive movement,°no-where\\nnowhere does the will act without a structure already formed\\nfor it. Learning the higher movements, like walking,°talk-ing\\ntalking, etc., is but the formation of the organized structures of\\nthe body. If these be wanting, no matter how completely the\\nend and the proper means of reaching it are present to\\nconsciousness, the volition cannot be performed. If we leave\\nthe motor and sensory spheres and come to the higher ideal\\noperations, the evidence for the localization of functions is\\nmuch less complete and forcible. But we need only to°recog-nize\\nrecognize the dependence of thought upon sense for its materials,\\nand largely upon language for its form, to be aware that the\\nsame principles must, in some degree at least, hold here\\nalso. The fact that in thinking we never deal with the\\nultimate psychical elements, but with symbolic wholes, with\\nprocesses already integrated, is still more striking°psycho-logical\\npsychological evidence of the same fact. Just as it would take hours\\nto perform a simple act like dressing, if the motor functions\\n\\n ― 109 ―\\n                            \\ndid not become organized in the bodily structure, if the will\\nwere obliged to go into detail of the act, instead of simply\\nsetting the whole mechanism into operation to work itself\\nout, so in the intellectual sphere. If the various sensations\\nand ideas remained isolated, if they were not organized into\\nwholes, if they were not changed from material into°struc-ture\\nstructure, the mind would require hours to take in the meaning of\\na single sentence, or to reason out a simple inference. But\\nthe fact is that the mind does not deal with ultimate°ele-ments\\nelements; it always has integral wholes which it may grasp and\\nuse without endeavoring or needing to resolve them. And\\nthat there is some similar physiological grouping and°inte-gration\\nintegration, some corresponding organization of function in the\\nbrain, all artificial experiments upon animals, and all natural\\nexperiments, performed by disease upon man, go to show.\\n2. But there must be explicitly stated, what has°al-ready\\nalready been suggested; viz., that the degree of this°localiza-tion\\nlocalization, both as to definiteness and completeness, varies very\\ngreatly. The lower the function, the more perfectly and\\nnarrowly is it localized. The wider its scope, and the greater\\nits consequent necessity, the more complete and spatial, so to\\nspeak, its localization. Thus the functions of breathing,°di-gesting\\ndigesting, swallowing, etc., which are necessary to life, and\\nwhich have only indirect psychical bearings, have very°defi-nite\\ndefinite and thoroughly localized centres; while the higher°activ-ities\\nactivities, like walking, talking, reading, and writing, involving\\nmore and more activities and of a more complex kind, have\\nless and less definite local centres. In the higher activities\\nthere is no perfect mapping out at all, but all sorts of\\nshadings-off and variations. So if we consider the sensory\\nsphere, we find that, while the sense-centres may for some of\\nthe lower animals be made out pretty certainly, there is no\\nsuch certainty and agreement in the case of man. And the\\nreason is evident; in the animals, the sensations remain\\nmostly what they are—pure sense-feelings, while in man\\nthese sensations have been so related and interpreted that\\nthey have become for the most part perceptions, and even\\nhigher ideal relations. Consequently we find that ideas as\\nsuch have no localization whatever. There is not the°slight-est\\nslightest evidence whatever that any special idea, whether a°per-cept\\n ― 110 ―\\n                            \\npercept, an image, or a concept, has any definite specific centre.\\nThere are all kinds of evidence that it has not. The elaborate\\ncalculations of Mr. Bain in his work upon Mind and Body\\ngoing to show that there are as many fibres and cells in the\\nbrain as the mind has separate ideas and associations, is\\nbased upon an utterly unfounded a priori assumption; viz.,\\nthat cells in the brain correspond to ideas, and fibres to\\nassociations. It cannot be stated too strongly, or insisted\\nupon too often, that there is not the slightest fragment of\\nexperimental evidence for the theory. There is much°experi-mental\\nexperimental evidence to show that the case cannot possibly stand\\nthus. This evidence may be summed up in the statement that\\nall lines of inquiry, morphological, anatomical, and°physio-logical\\nphysiological, converge to one result: the psychical function or\\nbearing of the cell is dependent, not on its own structure,\\nbut upon its connections by means of the fibres. An \"idea,\"\\nhowever simple it may seem, has not its physical basis in a\\ncell, but in a group of cells, connected and interconnected by\\nmultitudinous fibres. If the idea be very complex it may\\npossibly have relations to all the cells in the brain. This may\\nbe an extreme statement, but, beside the statement that any\\nidea may be localized in a given cell, it is truth itself. Hence\\nwe see the entire failure of all attempts definitely to localize\\nthe higher intellectual functions. The evidence does not°war-rant\\nwarrant the statement that, upon the whole, they have no°physi-cal\\nphysical connection; it does warrant the statement that the°rela-tions\\nrelations involved are so many, so far reaching, and so complex,\\nthat any attempt to find a sharply marked out centre must be\\nforever in vain.\\n3. The two statements already made that localization\\nis practically universal, and yet that the higher intellectual\\npowers cannot be definitely localized at all, do not contradict\\neach other. They find their reconciliation in the statement\\nthat localization is not original, but acquired. It has already\\nbeen stated that the localization is no quality originally\\ninherent in the cell; but that it depends upon the cell\\'s\\nconnections through its fibres. As Wundt says (Grundzüge,\\nvol. i, p. 225), \"No element executes specific functions, but\\nthe form of the latter depends upon the connections and\\nrelations of the cell.\" And this dependence of localized°func-tion\\n ― 111 ―\\n                            \\nfunction upon connection, is the same as to say that given°ele-ments\\nelements of the brain act in a certain way only because they\\nhave been associated in the performance of the act. The\\nlocalization is dependent upon use and exercise. Thus it is\\nthat Wundt goes on to state the two following principles:\\n\"Every definite function has, under given conditions of\\nconnection, a definite place in the central organ from which\\nit proceeds: that is to say, whose elements stand in relations\\nfitted for the execution of the function,\" and \"Every element\\nis the more fitted to the performance of a definite function,\\nthe more often it has been occasioned by external conditions\\nto its performance.\" Localization of function is, in short,\\nonly the physiological way of saying habit. The organization\\nof function is not indwelling in the brain as so much matter:\\nit has been learned by the brain and learned through the\\ntuition and care of the soul. By no twisting can the°phenom-ena\\nphenomena of localization of function be twisted into the support\\nof materialism. The very fibres and cells cry out against\\nsuch treatment. They all assert that the powers they have,\\nthey possess, not of their own original and indefeasible\\nright, but by means of the activity, and under the authority\\nof the soul. This accounts for the various degrees of°localiza-tion\\nlocalization found. The acts most necessary for the soul\\'s ends, and\\ntherefore oftenest performed, have, through heredity,°be-come\\nbecome definitely and completely organized, and, like reflex\\nactions, go on without consciousness, or, like instinctive\\nactions, involve others, which in complexity and far°reach-ing\\nreaching influence are beyond the immediate consciousness of the\\nmoment. But the soul, for its own ends, requires again that\\nits higher activities be not thus mechanized. There must be\\na constant growth, adjustment to new relations, intellectual\\nand moral, and this requires plasticity, variability. In the\\nhigher activities complete organization would mean°stagna-tion\\nstagnation, death. Thus it is that the higher we come, both in the\\nrange of animal life, and in the range of intellectual°func-tion\\nfunction, the less the localization. But in each case the evidence\\nall goes to show that the localization is not original, but is\\nacquired because the soul has repeatedly employed the given\\nelements for the performance of a given act. The soul does\\nnot write in water, but in the plastic brain and spinal cord.\\n\\n ― 112 ―\\n                            \\nLitera scripta manet. By the performance of its acts the soul\\ngains a mechanism by which to perform them again the\\nmore readily, economically, and perfectly.\\nThus we see how the phenomena of localization of\\nfunction give us a stand-point whence to view the nature of\\nthe immanence and transcendence of the soul. The soul is\\nimmanent in the body just so far as it has made the body its\\norganic instrument. The common saying that the \"body is\\nthe organ of the soul\" is literally much truer and more\\nsignificant than is usually thought or meant. The term\\n\"organ\" expresses a much more intimate and internal°rela-tion\\nrelation than is commonly understood. Organ presupposes°func-tion\\nfunction, and soul and body are related indeed as function and\\norgan, activity and instrument. As Aristotle said so long\\nago, the body is the organ of the soul, as the eye is the organ\\nof seeing. The body is not an external instrument which the\\nsoul has happened upon, and consequently uses, as a°musi-cian\\nmusician might happen upon a piano. The body is the organ of\\nthe soul because by the body the soul expresses and realizes\\nits own nature. It is the outward form and living°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of the soul. To quote from one of the most original and\\ndeeply spiritual thinkers whom America has yet produced:\\n\"It is the outward man, in and through which the inward\\npowers of the soul express their form and character. It is the\\nnecessary mode of our existence in the world of sense,°with-out\\nwithout the intervention of which we have no knowledge, either\\nobjective or subjective, no existence in nature, either in\\nspace or in time. It is not merely an organ to be conceived as\\ndistinct from our personal self, but it is our proper self as\\nexistent in space, in the order and under the laws of°na-ture\\nnature.\" President James Marsh, Remains, p. 257.\\n»2\\nBut this is only one-half the tale. The soul is immanent\\nin the body only because, and in so far as, it has realized\\nitself in the body. The body is its organ only because the\\nsoul has made the body its organ. The immanence is shown\\nby the localization; the transcendence, by the fact that this\\nlocalization has come about through the soul\\'s own°activi-ties\\nactivities. The body as an organ of the soul is the result of the\\n\\n ― 113 ―\\n                            \\ninforming, creating activity of the soul itself. In short, the\\nsoul is immanent in the body, not by virtue of the body as\\nmere body, but because, being transcendent, it has°ex-pressed\\nexpressed and manifested its nature in the body.\\nThe soul, accordingly, is not a powerless, impotent\\nsomething, so transcendent that it cannot be brought into\\nrelation with matter. It is a living and acting force which\\nhas formed, and is constantly forming the body, as its own\\nmechanism. This assures, on the one hand that no act or\\ndeed of the mind is ever lost, that it finds its registration and\\nrecord; and that not alone in some supralunary sphere, but\\ndown here in the world of matter; and, on the other hand, it\\nforms a mechanism by which the soul can immediately\\nknow, can grasp the fragments of its knowledge into one\\nsymbolic whole without laboriously gathering them and\\npiecing them together, and by which it can immediately act.\\nIt is, as it were, the mind\\'s automaton, ceaselessly and\\ntirelessly executing the demands responding to the needs of\\nthe soul. All the phenomena which the materialist parades\\nforth as \"proofs\"—the unconscious cerebration, the°auto-matic\\nautomatic, yet apparently intelligent, action in many states of\\nunconsciousness; the dependence of perception and memory\\nupon the proper condition and integrity of the brain; the\\naccompaniment of brain disease with unconsciousness and\\ninsanity; the ratio between mental power and weight and\\ncomplexity of the brain, etc., are the farthest removed from\\nevidence of materialism. They are but the conclusive°evi-dence\\nevidence of the thoroughness with which the soul has done its\\nwork, has formed its mechanism. They are all evidence that\\nthe soul is not hanging helpless in the air, but has made the\\nbody its home, and has realized itself so effectually in this\\nbody as its mechanism, that this mechanism can now act all\\nbut automatically, while disturbance of the mechanism of\\nthe organ excludes the execution of the corresponding°activ-ity\\nactivity, until the soul by its power form the organ again. The\\nmaterialist but looks at the body after the soul has done its\\nwork in making the body what it is, and cries, \"Lo, see what\\nthe body can do.\" Every one of the phenomena mentioned,\\nas well as all which the materialist can mention, concern the\\nformed body, the body in which the soul has already°organ-ized\\n ― 114 ―\\n                            \\norganized its functions. The true cry is, \"Lo, see what the soul\\nhas done. It has tabernacled in the flesh and transformed\\nthat flesh into its own manifestation. The body is the°body-ing\\nbodying forth of the soul.\"\\nIt was the \"master of those who know\" that said that\\nthe soul was the perfect realization or expression of a natural\\nbody, and at the same time, not the product of body, but its\\nvery life, its essence, its truth and reality—at once its final\\nand efficient cause. (Aristotle De Anima ii. 1.) And it was\\nthe Teacher of all who know, the Light which lighteth every\\nman that cometh into the world, who said: \"Except a corn\\nof wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone: but if\\nit die it bringeth forth much fruit.\" And it was the great\\ndisciple of the great Teacher who wrote \"That which thou\\nsowest is not quickened except it die; and that which thou\\nsowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare\\ngrain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain; but\\nGod giveth it a body as it has pleased Him, and to every seed\\nhis own body. . . . It is sown a natural body, it is raised a\\nspiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a°spirit-ual\\nspiritual body.\"\\nChristianity has no sympathy with those who have\\nsuch a superfine fear of materialism that they ætherialize\\nthe soul past all contact with the body. It knows that in the\\nbody the soul is incarnate; that through the soul the natural\\nbody comes to be a spiritual body, as the soul works itself\\nout, and realizes itself in it. The soul does apparently die in\\nthe body; it hides itself so effectually that the materialist says\\nthere is no soul; but it has died as dies the seed, to quicken\\nand transform the body. It is by no accident or meaningless\\nchance that we read in the Apostles\\' Creed those sublime\\nwords: \"I believe in the Resurrection of the Body.\" Catholic\\nhistoric Christianity, having such a confession on its lips,\\nhas no alliance with the metaphysical dualism of spirit and\\nmatter, and no fear of the exactest demonstrations of°phys-iology\\nphysiology regarding the closest connections of body and soul.\\nIt takes its stand upon the words of St. Paul, to which these\\ndemonstrations can only add more weight: \"There is a\\nnatural body and there is a spiritual body. . . . Howbeit\\nthat was not first which is spiritual, but that which is°natu-ral\\n ― 115 ―\\n                            \\nnatural; and afterwards that which is spiritual.\" There is the\\nbody, the natural body, first. Spirit indwells within the\\nbody, and manifesting itself, realizing its own nature, it\\nmakes that body its own organ and servant. It thus makes it\\nthe spiritual body. Let it be no surprise that physiological\\npsychology has revealed no new truth concerning the°rela-tions\\nrelations of soul and body. It can only confirm and deepen our\\ninsight into the truth divined by Aristotle and declared by\\nSt. Paul, and with good reason.\\n\\nDas Wahre war schon längst gefunden.\\n\\n ― 116 ―\\n                            \\nInventory of Philosophy Taught in American Colleges [First published in Science—Supplement, VII (16 Apr. 1886),\\n353-55. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nIn the general overhauling which the college curriculum has\\nbeen receiving of late, there has been one subject quite\\ngenerally overlooked,—that of philosophy. Apart from an\\noccasional editorial note in the columns of Science, I have\\nseen next to no allusion to the matter. Yet it is difficult to see\\nhow we are to develop a high grade of national culture in\\nscience and in literary matters without contact, by way\\neither of stimulus or of mirroring, or of both, of these\\nmatters with philosophic principles. Where this contact is to\\noccur, unless in college, it is also difficult to see. I have no\\nintention of discussing these matters here; but I wish to give\\nan inventory of the present condition of philosophic°instruc-tion\\ninstruction in our colleges, based upon the catalogues of these\\ninstitutions. Neither my knowledge nor the limit of space\\nallows me to go beyond a consideration of the subject taught\\nto discuss methods, etc.\\nThe philosophic discipline of the ordinary American\\ncollege is a survival of that period of its existence when its\\nespecial deed was to furnish to the community well-fortified\\nministers of the gospel. The catalogues of our colleges°re-veal\\nreveal all stages of evolution from this original source, but all\\nshow their genetic connection. The extent of evolution may\\nbe shown by considering the courses of four of the older\\nNew England institutions, selected from as many states. In\\nDartmouth the instruction begins with a twenty-four-hour\\ncourse in natural theology, followed by twenty hours of\\nanthropology. The pièce de resistance is sixty hours of°psy-chology\\npsychology (Porter\\'s Elements), which is supplemented by\\n\\n ― 117 ―\\n                            \\ncourses in ethics (twenty-five hours), history of ancient\\nphilosophy (twenty-six hours), æsthetics (fifteen hours),\\nand, to complete the circle with which the instruction began,\\na thirty-hour course in the evidences of Christianity. All\\nthis, certainly no insignificant amount, is required work.\\nThere is one elective of thirty-two hours in the history of\\nmodern philosophy.\\nCrossing the Connecticut River, and coming to the\\nUniversity of Vermont, we find the following courses:°psy-chology\\npsychology (Sully), logic (Davis\\'s Theory of Thought), ethics\\n(Calderwood), a short course in æsthetics, another short\\none in the evidences of religion, and quite an extensive\\ncourse in metaphysics, in which Watson\\'s Kant\\'s°Philoso-phy\\nPhilosophy in Extracts, and the exposition of Kant by Professor\\nMorris, are used. At Williams, as in the University of\\nVermont, all philosophical work seems to be required, the\\ncurriculum including the following subjects: anthropology\\n(Hopkins\\'s Outline Study of Man), logic, theology°(dog-matic\\n(dogmatic, apparently), natural theology (through the medium\\nof Flint\\'s Theism, and Butler\\'s Analogy), ethics, and the\\nhistory of philosophy. At Brown we find logic, three hours a\\nweek; intellectual philosophy, four hours, including studies\\nin Hamilton, Kant, Porter, Sully; ethics, five hours,°includ-ing\\nincluding Wayland, Calderwood, Kant, etc. There is also a course\\nin natural theology. In addition to these required courses,\\nthere is an elective in the history of philosophy.\\nNone of these colleges, it will be observed, is now a\\nprofessedly denominational college. It may be well,°accord-ingly\\naccordingly, to add one which is; viz., Trinity. Here the required\\nwork is ethics (through the medium of Wayland), Butler\\'s\\nAnalogy and his Sermons; metaphysics (Sir W. Hamilton),\\nand courses in psychology and logic. Elective courses are\\nthose in anthropology (Hopkins); ethics, two courses,—one\\nin Haven, and the other in Whewell and Plutarch, and\\nmetaphysics (McCosh). No very great differentiation is°ob-servable\\nobservable in these courses, although there is more ethics, and\\nmore ethics from a theological stand-point, in Trinity than\\nin other colleges.\\nWe turn now to the other end of the scale of evolution,\\nwhere the courses are almost wholly lecture courses, and\\n\\n ― 118 ―\\n                            \\nare, either entirely or in the major part, elective; and in\\nwhich, also, the instruction is mainly from the historical\\nside. Of such institutions, Harvard and the University of\\nMichigan are instances, perhaps the only ones. In the latter\\ncollege, the only required study in this line is a course in\\neither psychology (Murray) or logic (Jevons). Elective\\ncourses are, two in psychology, one in experimental and\\nanother in its relations to philosophic problems. The course\\nin the history of philosophy is three hours a week through\\nthe year. This is supplemented by a three-hour course in the\\nprinciples of philosophy, followed by a study of Hegel\\'s\\nLogic. The courses under the general head of ethics would\\ninclude a course in ethics, historical and theoretical; one in\\nthe philosophy of state and history; and a course each in\\nPlato\\'s Republic and Aristotle\\'s Ethics, occupying together\\ntwo hours per week through the year. Other courses are, one\\nin Spencer\\'s First Principles, and one each in æsthetics and\\nKant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason, the latter two being omitted\\nthis year.\\nThe Harvard courses include in the history of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, English philosophy, from Locke to Hume; French, from\\nDescartes to Leibnitz; and German, from Kant to Hegel;\\nand one each in German philosophy of the present day and\\nHegel\\'s Phänomenologie, which are omitted the present\\nyear. Psychology and logic (Bain and Jevons) are covered\\nin one course; there is also an advanced course in°experimen-tal\\nexperimental psychology. There is a course in the philosophy of°na-ture\\nnature, discussing Spinoza and Spencer. There are also five\\ncourses in ethics and philosophy of religion, comprehending\\none on philosophy in relation to ethics and religion (Royce\\'s\\nReligious Aspects of Philosophy); one on philosophy of\\nreligion; another on philosophic theism; one on historical\\nethics, including especially, it appears, Mill and Kant; and\\none on practical ethics of modern society. The account\\nwould be incomplete if we failed to notice Professor°Good-win\\nGoodwin\\'s courses in Plato\\'s Republic, and in the history of\\nphilosophy before Aristotle, with Professor Greenough\\'s\\ncourse on later Greek philosophy. All of these courses are\\nelective. It will be noticed that there are about the same\\nnumber of courses given in both the two last-mentioned\\n\\n ― 119 ―\\n                            \\nuniversities, but the courses appear to cover more hours per\\nyear at Harvard than at Michigan.\\nIntermediate between the two classes of colleges°dis-cussed\\ndiscussed, come, in the east, Yale and Princeton; in the west,\\nthe universities of Wisconsin and California. At Princeton\\nthere are required courses in psychology, logic, ethics, and\\nChristian evidences; elective courses in physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology, metaphysics, history of philosophy, and science of\\nreligion; and graduate courses in Plato\\'s philosophy, and\\none hour per week of discussion of philosophic problems. At\\nYale almost the only required studies in the senior year are\\nthe philosophic courses. The required studies are as follows:\\nlogic, psychology, ethics, natural theology, and evidences of\\nChristianity; the electives are, the history of philosophy, two\\nhours through the year; a course in Locke and Berkeley for\\ntwo hours first half-year, followed by \"special topics\" the\\nsecond half; and a two-hour course in physiological°psychol-ogy\\npsychology through the year.\\nThe list of colleges given might be considerably°in-creased\\nincreased; but it suffices, I think, to justify the division of\\ncolleges, so far as their philosophic teaching is concerned,\\ninto three classes, of which the first would include by far the\\ngreater number of institutions. Did space permit, it would\\nbe interesting to give the courses in two or three of the best\\nCanadian colleges. The practice there is to divide the°sub-jects\\nsubjects into \"pass\" and \"honor\" subjects; the former being\\npsychology, logic, and ethics, and the latter including quite\\na wide range. At McGill, for instance, besides courses in the\\nhistory of ancient and modern philosophy, the student must\\npass an examination on twelve masterpieces; for example,\\nAristotle\\'s Ethics, Descartes\\' Method and Meditations,°Spi-noza\\nSpinoza\\'s Ethics, Fraser\\'s Berkeley, Spencer\\'s First Principles,\\netc. At University College, Toronto, this honor-work°re-quires\\nrequires such solid reading as Green\\'s Introduction to Hume,\\nand his Prolegomena to Ethics.\\nFor the most part, these courses speak for themselves\\nto one familiar with the courses in German universities, or\\neven in Great Britain in the present renaissance of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy there. The greatest lack is undoubtedly in the°depart-ment\\ndepartment of the philosophy of nature. The philosophic°interpre-tation\\n ― 120 ―\\n                            \\ninterpretation and criticism of the principles of modern science seem\\nto be unknown save at Harvard and the University of°Michi-gan\\nMichigan. The greatest advance which any one familiar with the\\nphilosophic announcements of the last eight or ten years will\\nnotice is the growing tendency to introduce the history of\\nphilosophy, and especially the study of the originals,°partic-ularly\\nparticularly in Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and even Hegel. A striking\\nand welcome phenomenon is the increasing disuse of Sir\\nWilliam Hamilton. I do not say this with especial reference\\nto his philosophy, but because it is safe to say that the sole\\nideas which the vast majority of graduates of our colleges\\nhave of continental philosophy, have come, directly or°indi-rectly\\nindirectly, through Hamilton and Cousin; and it is difficult to\\nsay which is the more misleading as an authority in historic\\nphilosophy. Princeton presents one innovation, whence, I\\nthink, almost all of our colleges could learn something. It\\nhas called in men from its biological department to discuss\\nphysiological psychology. The discussion of the one subject\\nof visual sensation and perception could easily be made\\nremarkably fruitful for psychology, as well as leading up to\\nthe subject of space-perception in general, and the question\\nof empiricism and intuitionalism, and the function of°evolu-tion\\nevolution in psychical life. It is no discredit to our teachers of\\nphilosophy to say that it is almost impossible that they\\nshould have special knowledge in physiological psychology.\\nThe instructor of to-day has now, in the subject of logic,\\npsychology, ethics, the history of philosophy, and what is\\nvaguely called \"metaphysics,\" to cover a wider field than\\nthe teacher of any other branch; and restriction of subjects\\nrather than their enlargement is the need.\\nIt is impossible to discuss the subject of the future of\\nphilosophy-teaching in this country without reference to the\\nmooted question of \"electives.\" It is evident that the great\\nmajority of those American colleges that have not°intro-duced\\nintroduced the elective system are giving all the time to°philo-sophic\\nphilosophic studies possible, though I do not undertake to say\\nwhether or not that time be distributed in the wisest way. In\\nfact, the outside scoffer would probably say that relatively\\ntoo much time is given them, when all studies are required.\\nIt will be noticed that the colleges where least philosophy is\\n\\n ― 121 ―\\n                            \\nrequired are the ones where most is taught, and the ground\\nis most widely covered. Personally, I should not be surprised\\nto know that they are the ones where most vital interest is\\ntaken in these studies, save in the instances, happily many,\\nof the smaller colleges, where the philosophic teaching is in\\nthe hands of a man of such strong character that the°teach-ing\\nteaching is a lasting power for life in an ethical way, whatever\\nmay be said of the strictly technical value of the philosophy\\ntaught.\\n\\n ― 122 ―\\n                            \\nThe Psychological Standpoint [First published in Mind, XI (Jan. 1886), 1-19.

This is the sole condition of discussion\\nwhich shall be fruitful, and not word-bandying. It is the sole\\nway of discovering whatever of fundamental agreement\\nthere is between different tendencies of thought, as well as\\nof showing on what grounds the radical differences are\\nbased. It is therefore a most auspicious sign that, instead of\\neagerly clamoring forth our views on various subjects, we\\nare now trying to show why we hold them and why we\\nreject others. It is hardly too much to say that it is only\\nwithin the past ten years that what is vaguely called°Tran-scendentalism\\nTranscendentalism has shown to the English reading world just\\nwhy it holds what it does, and just what are its objections to\\nthe method most characteristically associated with English\\nthinking. Assertion of its results, accompanied with attacks\\nupon the results of Empiricism, and vice versa, we had\\nbefore; but it is only recently that the grounds, the reasons,\\nthe method have been stated. And no one can deny that the\\nwork has been done well, clearly, conscientiously and°thor-oughly\\nthoroughly. English philosophy cannot now be what it would\\nhave been, if (to name only one of the writers) the late\\nProfessor Green had not written. And now that the°differ-ences\\ndifferences and the grounds for them have been so definitely and\\nclearly stated, we are in a condition, I think, to see a°funda-mental\\nfundamental agreement, and that just where the difference has\\nbeen most insisted upon, viz., in the standpoint. It is the\\n\\n ― 123 ―\\n                            \\npsychological standpoint which is the root of all the°differ-ence\\ndifference, as Professor Green has shown with such admirable\\nlucidity and force. Yet I hope to be able to suggest, if not to\\nshow, that after all the psychological standpoint is what\\nboth sides have in common. In this present paper, I wish to\\npoint out that the defects and contradictions so powerfully\\nurged against the characteristic tendency of British°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy are due—not to its psychological standpoint but—to its\\ndesertion of it. In short, the psychological basis of English\\nphilosophy has been its strength: its weakness has been that\\nit has left this basis-that it has not been psychological\\nenough.\\nIn stating what is the psychological standpoint, care\\nhas to be taken that it be not so stated as to prejudge at the\\noutset the whole matter. This can be avoided only by stating\\nit in a very general manner. Let Locke do it. \"I thought that\\nthe first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of\\nman was very apt to run into was to take a view of our own\\nunderstandings, examine our own powers, and see to what\\nthings they were adapted\" (Book i, ch. 1, § 7). This, with\\nthe further statement that \"Whatsoever is the object of the\\nunderstanding when a man thinks\" is an Idea, fixed the\\nmethod of philosophy. We are not to determine the nature of\\nreality or of any object of philosophical inquiry by°examin-ing\\nexamining it as it is in itself, but only as it is an element in our\\nknowledge, in our experience, only as it is related to our\\nmind, or is an \"idea.\" As Professor Fraser well puts it,\\nLocke\\'s way of stating the question \"involves the°fundamen-tal\\nfundamental assumption of philosophy, that real things as well as\\nimaginary things, whatever their absolute existence may\\ninvolve, exist for us only through becoming involved in what\\nwe mentally experience in the course of our self-conscious\\nlives\" (Berkeley, p. 20). Or, in the ordinary way of putting\\nit, the nature of all objects of philosophical inquiry is to be\\nfixed by finding out what experience says about them. And\\nPsychology is the scientific and systematic account of this\\nexperience. This and this only do I understand to be°essen-tial\\nessential to the psychological standpoint, and, to avoid°misunder-standing\\nmisunderstanding from the start, I shall ask the reader not to think\\nany more into it, and especially to avoid reading into it any\\n\\n ― 124 ―\\n                            \\nassumption regarding its \"individual\" and \"introspective\"\\ncharacter. The further development of the standpoint can\\ncome only in the course of the article.\\nNow that Locke, having stated his method,°immedi-ately\\nimmediately deserted it, will, I suppose, be admitted by all. Instead\\nof determining the nature of objects of experience by an\\naccount of our knowledge, he proceeded to explain our\\nknowledge by reference to certain unknowable substances,\\ncalled by the name of matter, making impressions on an\\nunknowable substance, called mind. While, by his method\\nhe should explain the nature of \"matter\" and of \"mind\"—\\ntwo \"inquiries the mind of man is very apt to run into\"—\\nfrom our own understandings, from \"ideas,\" he actually\\nexplains the nature of our ideas, of our consciousness,\\nwhether sensitive or reflective, from that whose°characteris-tic\\ncharacteristic, whether mind or matter, is to be not ideas nor°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness nor in any possible relation thereto, because utterly\\nunknowable. Berkeley, in effect, though not necessarily, as\\nit seems to me, in intention, deserted the method in his\\nreference of ideas to a purely transcendent spirit. Whether\\nor not he conceived it as purely transcendent, yet at all\\nevents, he did not show its necessary immanence in our\\nconscious experience. But Hume? Hume, it must be°con-fessed\\nconfessed, is generally thought to stand on purely psychological\\nground. This is asserted as his merit by those who regard\\nthe theory of the association of ideas as the basis of all\\nphilosophy; it is asserted as his defect by those who look at\\nhis sceptical mocking of knowledge as following necessarily\\nfrom his method. But according to both, he, at least, was\\nconsistently psychological. Now the psychological stand-\\npoint is this: nothing shall be admitted into philosophy\\nwhich does not show itself in experience, and its nature, that\\nis, its place in experience shall be fixed by an account of the\\nprocess of knowledge—by Psychology. Hume reversed this.\\nHe started with a theory as to the nature of reality and\\ndetermined experience from that. The only reals for him\\nwere certain irrelated sensations and out of these knowledge\\narises or becomes. But if knowledge or experience becomes\\nfrom them, then they are never known and never can be. If\\nexperience originates from them, they never were and never\\n\\n ― 125 ―\\n                            \\ncan be elements in experience. Sensations as known or°expe-rienced\\nexperienced are always related, classified sensations. That which\\nis known as existing only in experience, which has its°exist-ence\\nexistence only as an element of knowledge, cannot be the same\\nwhen transported out of knowledge, and made its origin. A\\nknown sensation has its sole existence as known; and to\\nsuppose that it can be regarded as not known, as prior to\\nknowledge, and still be what it is as known, is a logical feat\\nwhich it is hoped few are capable of. Hume, just as much as\\nLocke, assumes that something exists out of relation to\\nknowledge or consciousness, and that this something is°ulti-mately\\nultimately the only real, and that from it knowledge,°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, experience come to be. If this is not giving up the\\npsychological standpoint, it would be difficult to tell what is.\\nHume\\'s \"distinct perceptions which are distinct existences,\"\\nand which give rise to knowledge only as they are related to\\neach other, are so many things-in-themselves. They existed\\nprior to knowledge, and therefore are not for or within it.\\nBut it will be objected that all this is a total°misappre-hension\\nmisapprehension. Hume did not assume them because they were prior\\nto and beyond knowledge. He examined experience and\\nfound, as any one does who analyzes it, that it is made up of\\nsensations; that, however complex or immediate it appears\\nto be, on analysis it is always found to be but an aggregate\\nof grouped sensations. Having found this by analysis, it was\\nhis business, as it is that of every psychologist, to show how\\nby composition these sensations produce knowledge and°ex-perience\\nexperience. To call them things-in-themselves is absurd-they\\nare the simplest and best known things in all our experience.\\nNow this answer, natural as it is, and conclusive as it seems,\\nonly brings out the radical defect of the procedure. The\\ndependence of our knowledge upon sensations—or rather\\nthat knowledge is nothing but sensations as related to each\\nother—is not denied. What is denied is the correctness of the\\nprocedure which, discovering a certain element in°knowl-edge\\nknowledge to be necessary for knowledge, therefore concludes that\\nthis element has an existence prior to or apart from°knowl-edge\\nknowledge. The alternative is not complex. Either these°sensa-tions\\nsensations are the sensations which are known—sensations which\\nare elements in knowledge—and then they cannot be°em-ployed\\n ― 126 ―\\n                            \\nemployed to account for its origin; or they can be employed to\\naccount for its origin, and then are not sensations as they are\\nknown. In this case, they must be something of which°noth-ing\\nnothing can be said except that they are not known, are not in\\nconsciousness—that they are things-in-themselves. If, in\\nshort, these sensations are not to be made \"ontological,\"\\nthey must be sensations known, sensations which are°ele-ments\\nelements in experience; and if they exist only for knowledge,\\nthen knowledge is wherever they are, and they cannot°ac-count\\naccount for its origin. The supposed objection rests upon a\\ndistinction between sensations as they are known, and°sensa-tions\\nsensations as they exist. And this means simply that existence—\\nthe only real existence—is not for consciousness, but that\\nconsciousness comes about from it; it makes no difference\\nthat one calls it sensations, and another the \"real existence\"\\nof mind or matter. If one is anxious for a thing-in-itself in\\none\\'s philosophy, this will be no objection. But we who are\\npsychological, who believe in the relativity of knowledge,\\nshould we not make a halt before we declare a fundamental\\ndisparity between a thing as it is and a thing as it is known—\\nwhether that thing be sensation or what not?\\nAs this point is fundamental, let me dwell upon it a\\nlittle. All our knowledge originates from sensations. Very\\ngood. But what are these sensations? Are they the sensations\\nwhich we know: the classified related sensations: this smell,\\nor this color? No, these are the results of knowledge. They\\ntoo presuppose sensations as their origin. What about these\\noriginal sensations? They existed before knowledge, and\\nknowledge originated and was developed by their grouping\\nthemselves together. Now, waiving the point that knowledge\\nis precisely this grouping together and that therefore to tell\\nus that it originated from grouping sensations is a good deal\\nlike telling us that knowledge originated knowledge, that\\nexperience is the result of experience,—I must inquire again\\nwhat these sensations are. And I can see but this simple\\nalternative: either they are known, are, from the first,°ele-ments\\nelements in knowledge, and hence cannot be used to account\\nfor the origin of knowledge; or they are not, and, what is\\nmore to the point, they never can be. As soon as they are\\nknown, they cease to be the pure sensation we are after and\\n\\n ― 127 ―\\n                            \\nbecome an element in experience, of knowledge. The°conclu-sion\\nconclusion of the matter is, that sensations which can be used to\\naccount for the origin of knowledge or experience, are°sensa-tions\\nsensations which cannot be known, are things-in-themselves\\nwhich are not relative to consciousness. I do not here say\\nthat there are not such: I only say that, if there are, we have\\ngiven up our psychological standpoint and have become\\n\"ontologists\" of the most pronounced character.\\nBut the confusion is deeply rooted, and I cannot hope\\nthat I have yet shown that any attempt to show the origin of\\nknowledge or of conscious experience, presupposes a°divi-sion\\ndivision between things as they are for knowledge or experience\\nand as they are in themselves, and is therefore°non-psycho-logical\\nnon-psychological in character. I shall be told that I am making the\\nwhole difficulty for myself; that I persist in taking the stand-\\npoint of an adult whose experience is already formed; that I\\nmust become as an infant to enter the true psychological\\nkingdom. If I will only go back to that stage, I shall find a\\npoint where knowledge has not yet begun, but where°sensa-tions\\nsensations must be supposed to exist. Owing to our different\\nstanding, since these sensations have to us been covered with\\nthe residues of thousands of others and have become°sym-bolic\\nsymbolic of them, we cannot tell what these sensations are;\\nthough in all probability they are to be conceived in some\\nanalogy to nervous shocks. But the truth of our°psychologi-cal\\npsychological analysis does not depend upon this. The fact that°sensa-tions\\nsensations exist before knowledge and that knowledge comes\\nabout by their organic registration and integration is°undis-puted\\nundisputed. And I can imagine that I am told that if I would but\\nconfine myself to the analysis of given facts, I should find\\nthis whole matter perfectly simple—that the sensations have\\nnot the remotest connection with any sort of \"metaphysics\"\\nor analogy with things-in-themselves, and that we are all the\\ntime on positive scientific ground. I hope so. We are°cer-tainly\\ncertainly approaching some degree of definiteness in our°con-ception\\nconception of what constitutes a sensation. But I am afraid that\\nin thus defining the nature of a sensation, in taking it out of\\nthe region of vagueness, my objector has taken from it all\\nthose qualities which would enable it to serve as the origin of\\nknowledge or of conscious experience. It is no longer a\\n\\n ― 128 ―\\n                            \\nthing-in-itself, but neither is it, I fear, capable of accounting\\nfor experience. For, alas, we have to use experience to°ac-count\\naccount for it. An infant, whether I think myself back to my\\nearly days or select some other baby, is, I suppose, a known\\nobject existing in the world of experience; and his nervous\\norganism and the objects which affect it, these too, I°sup-pose\\nsuppose, are known objects which exist for consciousness.\\nSurely it is not a baby thing-in-itself which is affected, nor a\\nworld thing-in-itself which calls forth the sensation. It is the\\nknown baby and a known world in definite action and°reac-tion\\nreaction upon each other, and this definite relation is precisely a\\nsensation. Yes, we are on positive scientific ground, and for\\nthat very reason we are on ground where the origin of\\nknowledge and experience cannot be accounted for. Such a\\nsensation I can easily form some conception of. I can even\\nimagine how such sensations may by their organic°registra-tion\\nregistration and integration bring about that knowledge which I\\nmay myself possess. But such a sensation is not prior to\\nconsciousness or knowledge. It is but an element in the\\nworld of conscious experience. Far from being that from\\nwhich all relations spring, it is itself but one relation—the\\nrelation between an organic body, and one acting upon it.\\nSuch a sensation, a sensation which exists only within and\\nfor experience, is not one which can be used to account for\\nexperience. It is but one element in an organic whole, and\\ncan no more account for the whole, than a given digestive\\nact can account for the existence of a living body, although\\nthis digestive act and others similar to it may no doubt be\\nshown to be all important in the formation of a given living\\nbody. In short, we have finally arrived at the root of the\\ndifficulty. Our objector has been supposing that he could\\naccount for the origin of consciousness or knowledge°be-cause\\nbecause he could account for the process by which the given\\nknowledge of a given individual came about. But if he\\naccounts for this by something which is not known, which\\ndoes not exist for consciousness, he is leaving the°psycholog-ical\\npsychological standpoint to take the ontological; if he accounts for it\\nby a known something, as a sensation produced by the\\nreaction of a nervous organism upon a stimulus, he is°ac-counting\\naccounting for its origin from something which exists only for\\n\\n ― 129 ―\\n                            \\nand within consciousness. Consequently he is not accounting\\nfor the origin of consciousness or knowledge as such at all.\\nHe is simply accounting for the origin of an individual\\nconsciousness, or a specific group of known facts, by°refer-ence\\nreference to the larger group of known facts or universal°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. Hence also the historic impotency of all forms of\\nmaterialism. For either this matter is unknown, is a thing-\\nin-itself, and hence may be called anything else as well as\\nmatter; or it is known, and then becomes but one set of the\\nrelations which in their completeness constitute mind,—\\nwhen to account for mind from it is to assume as ultimate\\nreality that which has existence only as substantiated by\\nmind. To the relations of the individual to the universal\\nconsciousness, I shall return later. At present, I am°con-cerned\\nconcerned only to point out that, if a man comes to the°conclu-sion\\nconclusion that all knowledge is relative, that existence means\\nexistence for consciousness, he is bound to apply this°conclu-sion\\nconclusion to his starting-point and to his process. If he does this,\\nhe sees that the starting-point (in this case, sensations) and\\nthe process (in this case, integration of sensations) exists\\nfor consciousness also-in short, that the becoming of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness exists for consciousness only, and hence that°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness can never have become at all. That for which all\\norigin and change exists, can never have originated or\\nchanged.\\nI hope that my objector and myself have now got\\nwithin sight of each other so that we can see our common\\nground, and the cause of our difference. We both admit that\\nthe becoming of certain definite forms of knowledge, say\\nSpace, Time, Body, External World, etc., etc., may (in\\nideal, at least, if not yet as matter of actual fact) be°ac-counted\\naccounted for, as the product of a series of events. Now he\\nsupposes that, because the origin of some or all of our\\nknowledge or conscious experience, knowledge of all°partic-ular\\nparticular things and of all general relations, can be thus°ac-counted\\naccounted for, he has thereby accounted for the origin of\\nconsciousness or knowledge itself. All I desire to point out is\\nthat he is always accounting for their origin within°knowl-edge\\nknowledge or conscious experience, and that he cannot take his\\nfirst step or develop this into the next, cannot have either\\n\\n ― 130 ―\\n                            \\nbeginning or process, without presupposing known elements\\n—the whole sphere of consciousness, in fact. In short, what\\nhe has been doing, is not to show the origin of consciousness\\nor knowledge, but simply how consciousness or knowledge\\nhas differentiated itself into various forms. It is indeed the\\nbusiness of the psychologist to show how (not the ideas of\\nspace and time, etc., but) space, time, etc., arise, but since\\nthis origin is only within or for consciousness, it is but the\\nshowing of how knowledge develops itself; it is but the\\nshowing of how consciousness specifies itself into various\\ngiven forms. He has not been telling us how knowledge\\nbecame, but how it came to be in a certain way, that is, in a\\ncertain set of relations. In making out the origin of any or all\\nparticular knowledges (if I may be allowed the word), he is\\nbut showing the elements of knowledge. And in doing this,\\nhe is performing a twofold task. He is showing on the one\\nhand what place they hold within experience, i.e., he is\\nshowing their special adequacy or validity, and on the other\\nhe is explicating the nature of consciousness or experience.\\nHe is showing that it is not a bare form, but that, since these\\ndifferent elements arise necessarily within it, it is an infinite\\nrichness of relations. Let not the psychologist imagine then\\nthat he is showing the origin of consciousness, or of°experi-ence\\nexperience. There is nothing but themselves from which they can\\noriginate. He is but showing what they are, and, since they\\nare, what they always have been.\\nI hope that it has now been made plain that the polemic\\nagainst the attempt of the psychologist to account for the\\norigin of conscious experience does not originate in any\\ndesire to limit his sphere but simply to call him away from a\\nmeaningless and self-contradictory conception of the°psy-chological\\npsychological standpoint to an infinitely fruitful one. The°psy-chological\\npsychological standpoint as it has developed itself is this: all\\nthat is, is for consciousness or knowledge. The business of\\nthe psychologist is to give a genetic account of the various\\nelements within this consciousness, and thereby fix their\\nplace, determine their validity, and at the same time show\\ndefinitely what the real and eternal nature of this°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness is. If we actually believe in experience, let us be in\\nearnest with it, and believe also that if we only ask, instead\\nof assuming at the outset, we shall find what the infinite\\n\\n ― 131 ―\\n                            \\ncontent of experience is. How experience became we shall\\nnever find out, for the reason that experience always is. We\\nshall never account for it by referring it to something else,\\nfor \"something else\" always is only for and in experience.\\nWhy it is, we shall never discover, for it is a whole. But how\\nthe elements within the whole become we may find out, and\\nthereby account for them by referring them to each other\\nand to the whole, and thereby also discover why they are.\\nWe have now reached positive ground, and, in the\\nremainder of the paper, I wish to consider the relations,\\nwithin this whole, of various specific elements which have\\nalways been \"inquiries into which the mind of man was very\\napt to run,\" viz.: the relations of subject and object, and the\\nrelations of Universal and Individual, or Absolute and°Fi-nite\\nFinite.\\nII.\\n\\nFrom the psychological standpoint the relation of°sub-ject\\nsubject and object is one which exists within consciousness.\\nAnd its nature or meaning must be determined by an°exami-nation\\nexamination of consciousness itself. The duty of the psychologist\\nis to show how it arises for consciousness. Put from the\\npositive side, he must point out how consciousness°differen-tiates\\ndifferentiates itself so as to give rise to the existence within, that is\\nfor, itself of subject and object. This operation fixes the\\nnature of the two (for they have no nature aside from their\\nrelation in consciousness), and at the same time explicates\\nor develops the nature of consciousness itself. In this case, it\\nreveals that consciousness is precisely the unity of subject\\nand object.\\nNow Psychology has never been so false to itself as to\\nutterly forget that this is its task. From Locke downwards\\nwe find it dealing with the problems of the origin of space,\\ntime, the \"ideas\" of the external world, of matter, of body,\\nof the Ego, etc., etc. But it has interpreted its results so as to\\ndeprive them of all their meaning. It has most successfully\\navoided seeing the necessary implications of its own°proce-dure\\nprocedure. There are in particular two interpretations by which it\\nhas evaded the necessary meaning of its own work.\\nThe first of these I may now deal with shortly, as it is\\n\\n ― 132 ―\\n                            \\nnothing but our old friend x, the thing-in-itself in a new\\nguise. It is Reasoned or Transfigured Realism. It sees\\nclearly enough that everything which we know is relative to\\nour consciousness, and it sees also clearly enough that our\\nconsciousness is also relative. All that we can know exists\\nfor our consciousness; but when we come to account for our\\nconsciousness we find that this too is dependent. It is°de-pendent\\ndependent on a nervous organism; it is dependent upon objects\\nwhich affect this organism. It is dependent upon a whole\\nseries of past events formulated by the doctrine of evolution.\\nBut this body, these objects, this series of events, they too\\nexist but for our consciousness. Now there is no°\"metaphys-ics\\n\"metaphysics\" about all this. It is positive science. Still there is a\\ncontradiction. Consciousness at once depends upon objects\\nand events, and these depend upon, or are relative to°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. Hence the fact of the case must be this: The\\nnervous organism, the objects, the series of events as known\\nare relative to our consciousness, but since this itself is\\ndependent, is a product, there is a reality behind the°proc-esses\\nprocesses, behind our consciousness, which has produced them\\nboth. Subject and object as known are relative to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, but there is a larger circle, a real object from which\\nboth of them emerge, but which can never be known, since\\nto know is to relate to our consciousness. This is the°prob-lem\\nproblem: on one hand, the relativity of all knowledge to our\\nconsciousness; on the other, the dependence of our°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness on something not itself. And this is the solution:\\na real not related to consciousness, but which has produced\\nboth consciousness itself, and the objects which as known\\nare relative to consciousness. Now all that has been said in\\nthe first part of this article has gone for naught if it is not\\nseen that such an argument is not a solution of the°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction, but a statement of it. The problem is to reconcile the\\nundoubted relativity of all existence as known, to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, and the undoubted dependence of our own°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness. And it ought to be evident that the only way to°recon-cile\\nreconcile the apparent contradiction, to give each its rights°with-out\\nwithout denying the truth of the other, is to think them together.\\nIf this is done, it will be seen that the solution is that the\\nconsciousness to which all existence is relative is not our\\n\\n ― 133 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness, and that our consciousness is itself relative to\\nconsciousness in general. But Reasoned Realism attempts to\\nsolve the problem not by bringing the elements together, but\\nby holding them apart. It does not seek the higher unity\\nwhich enables each to be seen as indeed true, but it attempts\\nto divide. It attributes one element of the contradiction to\\nour consciousness, and another to a thing-in-itself—the°un-known\\nunknown reality. But this is only an express statement of the\\ncontradiction. If all be relative to consciousness, there is\\nno thing-in-itself, just consciousness itself. If there be a\\nthing-in-itself then all is not relative to consciousness. Let a\\nman hold the latter if he will, but let him expressly°recog-nize\\nrecognize that thereby he has put himself on \"ontological\"\\nground and adopted an \"ontological\" method. Psychology\\nhe has for ever abandoned.\\nThe other evasion is much more subtle and°\"rea-soned\\n\"reasoned.\" It is a genuine attempt to untie the Gordian knot, as\\nthe other was a slashing attempt to cut it with the sword of a\\nthing-in-itself. It is Subjective Idealism. And I wish now to\\nshow that Subjective Idealism is not the meaning of the\\npsychological standpoint applied to the relation of subject\\nand object. It is rather a misinterpretation of it based upon\\nthe same refusal to think two undoubted facts in their unity,\\nthe same attempt to divide the contradiction instead of°solv-ing\\nsolving it, which we have seen in the case of attempts to°deter-mine\\ndetermine the origin of knowledge, and of Transfigured Realism.\\nThe position is this: The necessary relation of the world of\\nexistences to consciousness is recognized. \"There is no°pos-sible\\npossible knowledge of a world except in reference to our minds\\n—knowledge is a state of mind. The notion of material\\nthings is a mental fact. We are incapable even of discussing\\nthe existence of an independent material world; the very fact\\nis a contradiction. We can speak only of a world presented\\nto our own minds\" (Bain, The Senses and the Intellect, p.\\n375). But this being stated, consciousness is now separated\\ninto two parts—one of which is the subject, which is°identi-fied\\nidentified with mind, Ego, the Internal; while the other is the\\nobject, which is identified with the External, the Non-Ego,\\nMatter. \"Mind is definable, in the first instance, by the\\nmethod of contrast, or as a remainder arising from°subtract-ing\\n ― 134 ―\\n                            \\nsubtracting the object world from the totality of conscious experi-\\nence\" (Bain, p. 1). \"The totality of our mental life is made\\nup of two kinds of consciousness—the object consciousness\\nand the subject consciousness. The first is the external\\nworld, or Non-Ego; the second is our Ego, or mind proper\"\\n(Bain, p. 378). Consciousness \"includes our object states as\\nwell as our subject states. The object and subject are both\\nparts of our being, as I conceive, and hence we have a\\nsubject consciousness, which is in a special sense Mind (the\\nscope of mental science), and an object consciousness in\\nwhich all other sentient beings participate, and which gives\\nus the extended and material universe\" (Bain, p. 669). It\\nis, of course, still kept in view (which constitutes the logical\\nsuperiority of Subjective Idealism over Realism) that \"the\\nobject consciousness, which we call Externality, is still a\\nmode of self in the most comprehensive sense\" (Bain, p.\\n378). \"Object experience is still conscious experience, that\\nis Mind\" (Bain, p. 2). I have quoted at this length because\\nthe above passages seem to me an admirable statement of a\\nrepresentative type of Subjective Idealism.\\nThe logic of the process seems to be as follows. It is\\nrecognized that all existence with which philosophy or°any-thing\\nanything else has to do must be known existence-that is, that\\nall existence is for consciousness. If we examine this°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, we shall find it testifying to \"two kinds of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness\"—one, a series of sensations, emotions and ideas,\\netc., the other, objects determined by spatial relations. We\\nhave to recognize then two parts in consciousness, a subject\\npart, mind more strictly speaking, and an object part,°com-monly\\ncommonly called the external world or matter. But it must not\\nbe forgotten that this after all is a part of my own being, my\\nconsciousness. The subject swallows up the object. But this\\nsubject, again, \"segregates\" itself into \"two antithetical\\nhalves,\" into \"two parts,\" the subject and the object. Then\\nagain the object vanishes into the subject, and again the\\nsubject divides itself. And for ever the process is kept up.\\nNow the point I wish to make is that consciousness is here\\nused in two entirely different senses, and that the apparent\\nplausibility of the argument rests upon their confusion.\\nThere is consciousness in the broad sense, consciousness\\n\\n ― 135 ―\\n                            \\nwhich includes subject and object; and there is°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness in the narrow sense, in which it is equivalent to\\n\"mind,\" \"Ego,\" that is, to the series of conscious states.\\nThe whole validity of the argument rests, of course, upon\\nthe supposition that ultimately these two are just the same\\n—that it is the individual consciousness, the \"Ego,\" which\\ndifferentiates itself into the \"two kinds of consciousness,\"\\nsubject and object. If not, \"mind,\" as well as \"matter\"—the\\nseries of psychical states or events which constitute the Ego\\nand are \"the scope of mental science,\" as well as that in\\nwhich all \"sentient beings participate\"—is but an element in\\nconsciousness. If this be so, Subjective Idealism is°aban-doned\\nabandoned and Absolute Idealism (to which I hardly need say\\nthis article has been constantly pointing) is assumed. The\\nessence of Subjective Idealism is that the subject°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness or mind, which remains after the \"object world has\\nbeen subtracted,\" is that for which after all this object world\\nexists. Were this not so—were it admitted that this subject,\\nmind, and the object, matter, are both but elements within,\\nand both exist only for, consciousness—we should be in the\\nsphere of an eternal absolute consciousness, whose partial\\nrealization both the individual \"subject\" and the \"external\\nworld\" are. And I wish to show that this is the only meaning\\nof the facts of the case; that Subjective Idealism is but the\\nbald statement of a contradiction.\\nThis brief digression is for the purpose of showing\\nthat, to Subjective Idealism, the consciousness for which all\\nexists is the consciousness which is called mind, Ego, \"my\\nbeing.\" The point which I wished to make was that this\\nidentification is self-contradictory, although it is absolutely\\nnecessary to this form of Idealism. I shall be brief here in\\norder not to make a simple matter appear complicated. How\\ncan consciousness which gives rise to the \"two kinds\" of\\nconsciousness be identified with either of them? How can the\\nconsciousness which in its primary aspect exists in time as a\\nseries of psychical events or states be the consciousness for\\nwhich a permanent world of spatially related objects, in\\nwhich \"all sentient beings participate,\" exists? How can the\\n\"mind\" which is defined by way of \"contrast,\" which exists\\nafter the object world has been \"subtracted\" be the mind\\n\\n ― 136 ―\\n                            \\nwhich is the whole, of which subject and object are alike\\nelements? To state that the mind, in the first instance, is but\\nthe remainder from the totality of conscious experience\\n\"minus the object world,\" and to state also \"that this object\\nworld is itself a part of mind,\"—what is that but to state in\\nterms a self-contradiction? Unless it be to state that this\\nway of looking at mind, \"in the first instance,\" is but a\\npartial and unreal way of looking at it, and that mind in\\ntruth is the unity of subject and object, one of which cannot\\nbe subtracted from the other, because it has absolutely no\\nexistence without the other. Is it not a self-contradiction to\\ndeclare that the \"scope of mental science\" is subject°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness or mind, and at the same time to declare that\\n\"both subject and object are parts of our being,\" are but\\n\"two kinds\" of consciousness? Surely Psychology ought to\\nbe the science of our whole being, and of the whole°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. But no words can make the contradiction clearer\\nthan the mere statement of it. The only possible hypothesis\\nupon which to reconcile the two statements that mind is\\nconsciousness with the object world subtracted, and that it is\\nthe whole of our conscious experience, including both°sub-ject\\nsubject and object world, is that the term \"Mind\" is used in two\\nentirely different senses in the two cases. In the first it must\\nbe individual mind, or consciousness, and in the second it\\nmust be absolute mind or consciousness, for and in which\\nalone the individual or subject consciousness and the°exter-nal\\nexternal world or object consciousness exist and get their reality.\\nThe root of the whole difficulty is this. It is the°busi-ness\\nbusiness of Psychology to take the whole of conscious experience\\nfor its scope. It is its business to determine within this whole\\nwhat the nature of subject and object are. Now Subjective\\nIdealism identifies at the outset, as may be seen in the\\npassages quoted, subject with \"Mind,\" \"Ego,\" and object\\nwith \"Matter,\" \"Non-Ego,\" \"External World,\" and then\\ngoes on to hold that the \"scope\" of Psychology is the former\\nonly. In short, the psychological standpoint, according to\\nwhich the nature of subject and object was to be determined\\nfrom the nature of conscious experience, was abandoned at\\nthe outset. It is presumed that we already know what the\\n\"subject\" is, and Psychology is confined to treatment of\\n\\n ― 137 ―\\n                            \\nthat. It is assumed that we know already what the \"object\"\\nis, and Psychology is defined by its elimination. This\\nmethod, as Psychology, has two vices. It is \"ontological,\"\\nfor it sets up some external test to fix upon the nature of\\nsubject and object; and it is arbitrary, for it dogmatically\\npresupposes the limitation of Psychology to a series of°sub-jective\\nsubjective states. It assumes that Psychology instead of being\\nthe criterion of all, has some outside criterion from which its\\nown place and subject-matter is determined, and more°spe-cifically\\nspecifically, it assumes that the standpoint of Psychology is\\nnecessarily individual or subjective. Why should we be told\\nthat the scope of Psychology is subject consciousness, and\\nsubject consciousness be defined as the totality of conscious\\nexperience minus the object world, unless there is°presup-posed\\npresupposed a knowledge of what subject and object are? How\\ndifferent is the method of the true psychological standpoint!\\nIt shows how subject and object arise within conscious°expe-rience\\nexperience, and thereby develops the nature of consciousness. It\\nshows it to be the unity of subject and object. It shows\\ntherefore that there cannot be \"two kinds\" of consciousness,\\none subject, the other object, but that all consciousness\\nwhether of \"Mind,\" or of \"Matter\" is, since consciousness,\\nthe unity of subject and object. Consciousness may, and\\nundoubtedly does, have two aspects—one aspect in which it\\nappears as an individual, and another in which it appears as\\nan external world over against the individual. But there are\\nnot two kinds of consciousness, one of which may be°sub-tracted\\nsubtracted from the whole and leave the other. They are but\\nconsciousness in one phase, and how it is that consciousness\\nassumes this phase, how it is that this division into the\\nindividual and the external world arises for consciousness\\n(in short, how consciousness in one stage appears as°percep-tion\\nperception),—that is precisely the business of Psychology to°deter-mine\\ndetermine. But it does not determine it by assuming at the outset\\nthat the subject is \"me,\" and the object is the world. And if\\nthis be not assumed at the outset it certainly will not be\\nreached at the conclusion. The conclusion will show that the\\ndistinction of consciousness into the individual and the world\\nis but one form in which the relation of subject and object,\\nwhich everywhere constitutes consciousness, appears. This\\n\\n ― 138 ―\\n                            \\nbrings us definitely to the relation of the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness.\\nIII.\\n\\nWe have seen that the attempt to account for the origin\\nof knowledge, at bottom, rests on the undoubted fact that\\nthe individual consciousness does become, but also that the\\nonly way to account for this becoming, without°self-contra-diction\\nself-contradiction, is by the postulate of a universal consciousness. We\\nhave seen again that the truth at the bottom of Subjective\\nIdealism is the undoubted fact that all existence is relative to\\nour consciousness, but also that the only consistent meaning\\nof this fact is that our consciousness as individual is itself\\nrelative to a universal consciousness. And now I am sure\\nthat my objector, for some time silent, will meet me with\\nrenewed vigor. He will turn one of these arguments against\\nthe other and say: \"After all, this consciousness for which\\nall exists is your individual consciousness. The universal\\nconsciousness itself exists only for it. You may say indeed\\nthat this individual consciousness, which has now absorbed\\nthe universal again, shows the universal as necessary to its\\nown existence, but this is only to fall into the contradiction\\nwhich you have already urged against a similar view on the\\npart of Subjective Idealism. Your objection in that case was\\nthat consciousness divided into subject consciousness and\\nobject consciousness, of which the former immediately°ab-sorbed\\nabsorbed the latter, and again subdivided itself into the subject\\nand object consciousness. You objected that this was the\\nexpress statement of a contradiction—the statement that the\\nsubject consciousness was and was not the whole of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. It was only as it was asserted to be the\\nwhole that any ground was found for Subjective Idealism;\\nbut only as it was regarded as a remainder left over from\\nsubtraction of the object world does it correspond to actual\\nexperience. Now you have yourself fallen into precisely this\\ncontradiction. You do but state that the individual°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness is and is not the universal consciousness. Only so far as\\nit is not, do you escape Subjective Idealism; only so far as it\\nis, do you escape the thing-in-itself. If this universal°con-sciousness\\n ― 139 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness is not for our individual consciousness, if it is not\\na part of our conscious experience, it is unknowable, a\\nthing-in-itself. But if it be a part of our individual°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, then after all the individual consciousness is the°ulti-mate\\nultimate. By your own argument you have no choice except\\nbetween the acceptance of an unknowable unrelated reality\\nor of Subjective Idealism.\"\\nThis objection amounts to the following disjunction:\\nEither the universal consciousness is the individual and we\\nhave Subjective Idealism; or, it is something beyond the\\nindividual consciousness, and we have a thing-in-itself. Now\\nthis dilemma looks somewhat formidable, yet its statement\\nshows that the objector has not yet put himself upon the\\npsychological ground: there is something of the old°\"onto-logical\\n\"ontological\" man left in him yet, for it assumes that he has, prior\\nto its determination by Psychology, an adequate idea of\\nwhat \"individual\" is and means. If he will take the°psycho-logical\\npsychological standpoint, he will see that the nature of the°individ-ual\\nindividual as well as of the universal must be determined within\\nand through conscious experience. And if this is so, all\\nground for the disjunction falls away at once. This°disjunc-tion\\ndisjunction rests upon the supposition that the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness are something opposed to each\\nother. If one were to assert that the meaning of the°individ-ual\\nindividual consciousness is that it is universal, the whole objection\\nloses not only its ground but its meaning; it becomes°non-sense\\nnonsense. But I am not concerned just at present to state this; I\\nam concerned only to point out that, if one starts with a\\npresupposition regarding the nature of the individual°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, one is leaving the psychological standpoint. In\\nforming the parallel between the position attributed to the\\nwriter and that of Subjective Idealism, the supposed°objec-tor\\nobjector was building wiser than perhaps he knew. The trouble\\nwith the latter view is that it supposes that consciousness\\nmay be divided into \"two kinds,\" one subjective, the other\\nobjective; that it presupposes, at the start, the nature of\\nsubject and object. The fact of the case is that, since°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness is the unity of subject and object, there is no\\npurely subjective or purely objective. So here. It is°presup-posed\\npresupposed that there are \"two kinds\" of consciousness, one°indi-vidual\\n ― 140 ―\\n                            \\nindividual, the other universal. And the fact will be found to be,\\nI imagine, that consciousness is the unity of the individual\\nand the universal; that there is no purely individual or\\npurely universal. So the disjunction made is meaningless.\\nBut however that may be, at all events it leaves the°psycho-logical\\npsychological basis, for it assumes that the nature of the individual\\nis already known.\\nThis has been said that it may be borne in mind from\\nthe outset that Psychology must determine within°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness the nature of the individual and the universal°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, thereby determining at once their place within°experi-ence\\nexperience, and explicating the nature of consciousness itself. And\\nthis, stated in plain terms, means simply that, since°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness does show the origin of individual and universal\\nconsciousness within itself, consciousness is therefore both\\nuniversal and individual. How this is, the present°arti-cle\\narticle, of course, does not undertake to say. Its more modest\\nfunction is simply to point out that it is the business of\\nPsychology to show the nature of the individual and the\\nuniversal and of the relation existing between them. These\\nmust not be presupposed, and then imported bodily to°deter-mine\\ndetermine the nature of psychologic experience. There has now\\nbeen rendered explicit what was implied concerning the\\npsychological standpoint from the first, viz., that it is a\\nuniversal standpoint. If the nature of all objects of°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical inquiry is to be determined from fixing their place\\nwithin conscious experience, then there is no criterion°out-side\\noutside of or beyond or behind just consciousness itself. To\\nadopt the psychological standpoint is to assume that°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness itself is the only possible absolute. And this is\\ntacitly assumed all the while by Subjective Idealism. The\\nmost obvious objection to Subjective Idealism is, of course,\\nthat it presupposes that, if \"mind were to become extinct,\\nthe annihilation of matter, space, time would result.\" And\\nthe equally obvious reply of Subjective Idealism is: \"My\\nconception of the universe even though death may have\\novertaken all its inhabitants, would not be an independent\\nreality, I should merely take on the object-consciousness of a\\nsupposed mind then present\" (Bain, p. 682). In short, the\\nreality of the external world, though I should imagine all\\n\\n ― 141 ―\\n                            \\nfinite minds destroyed, would be that I cannot imagine°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness destroyed. As soon as I imagine an external\\nworld, I imagine a consciousness in relation to which it\\nexists. One may put the objection from a side which gets\\nadded force with every advance of physical science. The\\nsimplest physiology teaches that all our sensations originate\\nfrom bodily states-that they are conditioned upon a nervous\\norganism. The science of biology teaches that this nervous\\norganism is not ultimate but had its origin; that its origin lies\\nback in indefinite time, and that as it now exists it is a result\\nof an almost infinite series of processes; all these events,\\nthrough no one knows how much time, having been°prece-dent\\nprecedent to your and my mind, and being the condition of their\\nexistence. Now is all this an illusion, as it must be, if its only\\nexistence is for a consciousness which is \"but a transition\\nfrom one state to another\"? The usual answer to this°argu-ment\\nargument is that it is an ignoratio elenchi: that it has°presup-posed\\npresupposed a consciousness for which these events existed; and\\nthat they have no meaning except when stated in terms of\\nconsciousness. This answer I have no call to rebut. But it\\nmust be pointed out that this is to suppose the individual\\nconsciousness capable of transcending itself and assuming a\\nuniversal standpoint—a standpoint whence it can see its own\\nbecoming, as individual. It is this implication of the°univer-sal\\nuniversal nature of the individual consciousness which has°consti-tuted\\nconstituted the strength of English philosophy; it is its lack of\\nexplication which has constituted its weakness. Subjective\\nIdealism has \"admitted of no answer and produced no°con-viction\\nconviction\" because of just this confusion. That which has\\nadmitted of no answer is the existence of all for°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness; that which has produced no conviction is the existence\\nof all for our consciousness as merely individual. English\\nphilosophy can assume its rightful position only when it has\\nbecome fully aware of its own presuppositions; only when it\\nhas become conscious of that which constitutes its essential\\ncharacteristic. It must see that the psychological standpoint\\nis necessarily a universal standpoint and consciousness°nec-essarily\\nnecessarily the only absolute, before it can go on to develop the\\nnature of consciousness and of experience. It must see that\\nthe individual consciousness, the consciousness which is but\\n\\n ― 142 ―\\n                            \\n\"transition,\" but a process of becoming, which, in its°pri-mary\\nprimary aspect, has to be defined by way of \"contrast,\" which\\nis but a \"part\" of conscious experience, nevertheless is when\\nviewed in its finality, in a perfectly concrete way, the°univer-sal\\nuniversal consciousness, the consciousness which has never become\\nand which is the totality; and that it is only because the\\nindividual consciousness is, in its ultimate reality, the°uni-versal\\nuniversal consciousness that it affords any basis whatever for\\nphilosophy.\\nThe case stands thus: We are to determine the nature\\nof everything, subject and object, individual and universal,\\nas it is found within conscious experience. Conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience testifies, in the primary aspect, my individual self is a\\n\"transition,\" is a process of becoming. But it testifies also\\nthat this individual self is conscious of the transition, that it\\nknows the process by which it has become. In short, the\\nindividual self can take the universal self as its standpoint,\\nand thence know its own origin. In so doing, it knows that it\\nhas its origin in processes which exist for the universal self,\\nand that therefore the universal self never has become.°Con-sciousness\\nConsciousness testifies that consciousness is a result, but that it\\nis the result of consciousness. Consciousness is the°self-re-lated\\nself-related. Stated from the positive side, consciousness has shown\\nthat it involves within itself a process of becoming, and that\\nthis process becomes conscious of itself. This process is the\\nindividual consciousness; but, since it is conscious of itself, it\\nis consciousness of the universal consciousness. All°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, in short, is self-consciousness, and the self is the\\nuniversal consciousness, for which all process is and which,\\ntherefore, always is. The individual consciousness is but the\\nprocess of realization of the universal consciousness through\\nitself. Looked at as process, as realizing, it is individual\\nconsciousness; looked at as produced or realized, as°con-scious\\nconscious of the process, that is, of itself, it is universal°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness.\\nIt must not be forgotten that the object of this paper is\\nsimply to develop the presuppositions which have always\\nbeen latent or implicit in the psychological standpoint. What\\nhas been said in the way of positive result has been said,\\ntherefore, only as it seemed necessary to develop the°mean-ing\\n ― 143 ―\\n                            \\nmeaning of the standpoint. It must also be remembered that it is\\nthe work of Psychology itself to determine the exact and\\nconcrete relations of subject and object, individual and°uni-versal\\nuniversal within consciousness. What has been said here, if\\nsaid only for the development of the standpoint, is therefore\\nexceedingly formal. To some of the more concrete problems\\nI hope to be able to return at another time.\\n\\n ― 144 ―\\n                            \\nPsychology as Philosophic Method [First published in Mind, XI (Apr. 1886), 153-73. Not reprinted by\\nthe author. For Shadworth H. Hodgson\\'s reply, see \"Illusory\\nPsychology,\" ibid. XI (Oct. 1886): 478-94  (print edition, pp. xli-lvii).]\\n»*\\nIn an article on \"The Psychological Standpoint\" [pp.\\n122-43], I endeavored to point out that the characteristic\\nEnglish development in philosophy—the psychological°move-ment\\nmovement since Locke—had been neither a \"threshing of old\\nstraw,\" nor a movement of purely negative meaning, whose\\nsignificance for us was exhausted when we had learned how\\nit necessarily led to the movement in Germany—the so-\\ncalled \"transcendental\" movement. Its positive significance\\nwas found to consist in the fact that it declared°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness to be the sole content, account and criterion of all\\nreality; and psychology, as the science of this consciousness,\\nto be the explicit and accurate determination of the nature of\\nreality in its wholeness, as well as the determination of the\\nvalue and validity of the various elements or factors of this\\nwhole. It is the ultimate science of reality, because it°de-clares\\ndeclares what experience in its totality is; it fixes the worth and\\nmeaning of its various elements by showing their°develop-ment\\ndevelopment and place within this whole. It is, in short, philosophic\\nmethod. But that paper was necessarily largely negative, for\\nit was necessary to point out that as matter of fact the\\nmovement had not been successful in presenting psychology\\nas the method of philosophy, for it had not been true to its\\nown basis and ideal. Instead of determining all, both in its\\ntotality and its factors, through consciousness, it had°en-deavored\\nendeavored to determine consciousness from something out of\\nand beyond necessary relation to consciousness. It had°deter-mined\\ndetermined its psychology from a dogmatically presupposed°on-tology\\nontology, instead of getting at its ontology from a critical\\nexamination of the nature and contents of consciousness, as\\n\\n ― 145 ―\\n                            \\nits standpoint required. It had a thing-in-itself, something\\nwhose very existence was to be opposed to consciousness, as\\nin the unknowable \"substances\" of Locke, the transcendent\\nDeity of Berkeley, the sensations or impressions of Hume\\nand Mill, the \"transfigured real\" of Spencer; and it used this\\nthing-in-itself as the cause and criterion of conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. Thus it contradicted itself; for, if psychology as\\nmethod of philosophy means anything, it means that nothing\\nshall be assumed except just conscious experience itself, and\\nthat the nature of all shall be ascertained from and within\\nthis.\\nIt is to the positive significance of psychology as°philo-sophic\\nphilosophic method—its significance when it is allowed to develop\\nitself free from self-contradictory assumptions—that this\\npresent paper is directed. It was suggested in the previous\\npaper that this method, taken in its purity, would show\\nsubstantial identity with the presuppositions and results of\\nthe \"transcendental\" movement. And as the principal°at-tacks\\nattacks upon the pretensions of psychology to be method for\\nphilosophy, or anything more than one of the special°sci-ences\\nsciences, have come from representatives of this movement,\\nthis paper must be occupied with treating psychology in\\nreference to what we may call German philosophy, as the\\nother treated it in reference to English philosophy. In so far\\nas the criticisms from this side have been occupied with\\npointing out the failure of the actual English psychology to\\nbe philosophy, there is of course no difference of opinion.\\nThat arises only in so far as these criticisms have seemed\\n(seemed, I repeat) to imply that the same objections must\\nhold against every possible psychology; while it seems to the\\nwriter that psychology is the only possible method.\\nIt is held, or seems to be held, by representatives of the\\npost-Kantian movement, that man may be regarded in two\\naspects, in one of which he is an object of experience like\\nother objects: he is a finite thing among other finite things;\\nwith these things he is in relations of action and reaction,\\nbut possesses the additional characteristic that he is a°know-ing\\nknowing, feeling, willing phenomenon. As such, he forms the\\nobject of a special science, psychology, which, like every\\nother special science, deals with its material as pure object,\\n\\n ― 146 ―\\n                            \\nabstracting from that creative synthesis of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, self-consciousness, through which all things are and are\\nknown. It is therefore, like all the special sciences, partial\\nand utterly inadequate to determining the nature and°mean-ing\\nmeaning of that whole with which philosophy has to deal. Nay\\nmore, it is itself ultimately dependent upon philosophy for\\nthe determination of the meaning, validity and limits of the\\nprinciples, categories and method which it unconsciously\\nassumes. To regard psychology therefore as philosophic\\nmethod is to be guilty of the same error as it would be to\\nregard the highest generalizations of, say, physics, as°ade-quate\\nadequate to determining the problems of philosophy. It is an\\nattempt to determine the unconditioned whole,°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness, by that which has no existence except as a°condi-tioned\\nconditioned part of this very whole.\\n\\nMetaphysics (says Professor Caird) has to deal with°con-ditions\\nconditions of the knowable, and hence with self-consciousness or that\\nunity which is implied in all that is and is known. Psychology has\\nto inquire how this self-consciousness is realised or developed in\\nman, in whom the consciousness of self grows with the°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness of a world in time and space, of which he individually is\\nonly a part, and to parts of which only he stands in immediate\\nrelation. In considering the former question we are considering\\nthe sphere within which all knowledge and all objects of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge are contained. In considering the latter, we are selecting\\none particular object or class of objects within this sphere. . . .\\nIt is possible to have a purely objective anthropology or°psychol-ogy\\npsychology—which abstracts from the relation of man to the mind that\\nknows him—just as it is possible to have a purely objective science\\nof nature.

With this infinite,\\n\\n ― 147 ―\\n                            \\nuniversal self-consciousness, philosophy deals; with man as\\nthe object of experience, psychology deals.\\nIn stating the position of the post-Kantian movement, I\\nused the word seemed, and used it advisedly, as I do not\\nconceive that at bottom there is any difference of opinion.\\nBut it seems to me that there are invariably involved in the\\nreasonings of this school certain presuppositions regarding\\nthe real science of psychology which, probably for the°rea-son\\nreason that the writers have seen such misuse made of a false\\npsychology, are not distinctly stated, and which,°accord-ingly\\naccordingly, not only lessen the convincing force with which their\\nreasonings are received by those unacquainted with the°ne-cessity\\nnecessity and rationality of these presuppositions, but which\\nalso, as not distinctly thought out, tend at times to involve\\nthese reasonings in unnecessary obscurity and even°contra-dictions\\ncontradictions. It is these presuppositions regarding the nature of a\\nreal psychology, lying at the basis of all the work of the\\npost-Kantian school, conditioning it and giving it its worth,\\nwhich it is the object of this paper to examine.\\nThe start is made accordingly from the supposed°dis-tinction\\ndistinction of aspects in man\\'s nature, according to one of\\nwhich he is an object of experience and the subject of\\npsychology, and according to the other of which, he, as\\nself-consciousness, is the universal condition and unity of all\\nexperience, and hence not an object of experience. As I have\\nalready referred to Professor Adamson\\'s treatment of this\\ndistinction, let me refer to a later writing of his which seems\\nto retract all that gave validity to this distinction. In a recent\\nnumber of Mind (vol. ix, p. 434), after pointing out that the\\nsubject-matter of psychology cannot be pure objects but\\nmust always be the reference of an individual subject to a\\ncontent which is universal, he goes on with the following\\nmost admirable statement:\\n\\nIt is in and through the conscious life of the individual that\\nall the thinking and acting which form the material for other\\ntreatment is realised. When we isolate the content and treat it as\\nhaving a quasi-existence per se, we are in the attitude of objective\\nor natural science. When we endeavour to interpret the°signifi-cance\\nsignificance of the whole, to determine the meaning of the connective\\nlinks that bind it together, we are in the attitude of philosophy.\\n\\n ― 148 ―\\n                            \\nBut when we regard the modes through which knowledge and\\nacting are realised in the life of an individual subject, we are in\\nthe position of the psychological inquirer.\\nNow, when psychology is defined as the science of the°reali-zation\\nrealization of the universe in and through the individual, all\\npretence of regarding psychology as merely one of the°spe-cial\\nspecial sciences, whose subject-matter by necessity is simply\\nsome one department of the universe, considered out of\\nrelation to the individual, is, of course, abandoned. With\\nthis falls, as a matter of course, the supposed two-fold°char-acter\\ncharacter of man\\'s nature. If the essence of his nature is to be the\\nrealization of the universe, there is no aspect in which, as\\nman, it appears as a mere object or event in the universe.\\nThe distinction is now transferred to the two ways of°look-ing\\nlooking at the same material, and no longer concerns two°dis-tinct\\ndistinct materials. Is this distinction, however, any more valid?\\nIs there any reason for distinguishing between the modes\\nthrough which the universe is realized in an individual, and\\nthe significance of this universe as a whole? At first sight\\nthere may appear to be, but let us consider the following\\nquestions. Does the whole have any significance beyond\\nitself? If we consider experience in its absolute totality so far\\nas realized in the individual, can the \"significance of the\\nwhole\" be determined beyond what itself testifies to as a\\nwhole; and do the \"connective links which bind together\"\\nhave any \"meaning\" except just as they do bind together?\\nAnd since this whole and these connective links are given to\\nus by the science of psychology, what is this except°com-pleted\\ncompleted philosophic method, and what more has philosophy to\\ndo except to abstract from this totality, and regard it, on its\\nmaterial side, as philosophy of nature, and on its formal as\\nreal logic? Psychology, as science of the realization through\\nthe individual of the universe, answers the question as to the\\nsignificance of the whole, by giving that whole, and at the\\nsame time gives the meaning of the parts and of their\\nconnection by showing just their place within this whole.\\nIt would be fatal to the existence of philosophy as well\\nas of psychology to make any distinction here. Were not the\\nuniverse realized in the individual, it would be impossible\\n\\n ― 149 ―\\n                            \\nfor the individual to rise to a universal point of view, and\\nhence to philosophize. That the universe has not been°com-pletely\\ncompletely realized in man is no more an objection to the°em-ployment\\nemployment of psychology as the determination of the nature of\\nthis universe, than it is to any treatment of philosophy\\nwhatever. In no way can the individual philosophize about a\\nuniverse which has not been realized in his conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. The universe, except as realized in an individual, has\\nno existence. In man it is partially realized, and man has a\\npartial science; in the absolute it is completely realized, and\\nGod has a complete science. Self-consciousness means°sim-ply\\nsimply an individualized universe; and if this universe has not\\nbeen realized in man, if man be not self-conscious, then no\\nphilosophy whatever is possible. If it has been realized, it is\\nin and through psychological experience that this realization\\nhas occurred. Psychology is the scientific account of this\\nrealization, of this individualized universe, of this°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness. What other account can be given? It is the object\\nof this paper to show that no other account can be given. Not\\nonly is any final distinction or dualism, even of aspects, in\\nman\\'s nature utterly untenable, but no distinction even of\\naspects can be made in the treatment of man\\'s nature.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology has to do with just the consciousness which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes man\\'s experience, and all further determinations of\\nexperience fall within this psychological determination of it,\\nand are hence abstract. More definitely, Psychology, and not\\nLogic, is the method of Philosophy. Let us deal seriatim\\nwith these two questions.\\nI.\\n\\nNo such distinction in the nature of man, as that in one\\naspect he is \"part of the partial world,\" and hence the\\nsubject of a purely natural science, psychology, and in°an-other\\nanother the conscious subject for which all exists, the subject\\nof philosophy, can be maintained. This is our first assertion.\\nLet us turn again to that most lucid and comprehensive\\nstatement of philosophic doctrine by Professor Caird, from\\nwhich extract has already been made. The distinction to be\\nupheld is that between the \"sphere in which all knowledge\\n\\n ― 150 ―\\n                            \\nand all objects of knowledge are contained\" and \"one°partic-ular\\nparticular object within this sphere.\" The question which at once\\narises is, How does this distinction come about? Granted\\nthat it is valid, how is man known as requiring in his nature\\nthis distinction for his proper comprehension? There is but\\none possible answer: it is a distinction which has arisen\\nwithin and from conscious experience itself. In the course of\\nman\\'s realization of the universe there is necessitated this\\ndistinction. This distinction therefore falls within the sphere\\nof psychology, and cannot be used to fix the position of\\npsychology. Much less can psychology be identified with\\nsome one aspect of experience which has its origin only\\nwithin that experience which in its wholeness constitutes the\\nmaterial of psychology. The distinction, as we shall°immedi-ately\\nimmediately see, cannot be an absolute one: by no possibility or\\ncontingency can man be regarded as merely one of objects of\\nexperience; but so far as the distinction has relative validity\\nit is a purely psychological one, originating because man in\\nhis experience, at different stages of it, finds it necessary to\\nregard himself in two lights,—in one of which he is a°partic-ular\\nparticular space- and time-conditioned being (we cannot say\\nobject or event) or activity, and in the other the°uncondi-tioned\\nunconditioned eternal synthesis of all. At most the distinction is only\\none of various stages in one and the same experience, both of\\nwhich, as stages of experience—one, indeed, of experience in\\nits partiality and the other of experience in its totality—fall\\nwithin the science of experience, viz., psychology.\\nWe will see how the question stands if we state it\\notherwise. Does or does not the self-consciousness of man\\nfall within the science of psychology? What reason can be\\ngiven for excluding it? Certainly few would be found so\\nthorough-going as to deny that perception is a matter which\\nthat science must treat; those however who admit perception\\nwould find themselves hard put to it to give a reason for\\nexcluding memory, imagination, conception, judgment,°rea-soning\\nreasoning. Why having reached the stage of reasoning, where\\nthe original implicit individual with which we began has\\nbeen broken up into the greatest possible number of explicit\\nrelations, shall we rule out self-consciousness where these\\nrelations are again seen united into an individual unity?\\n\\n ― 151 ―\\n                            \\nThere is no possible break: either we must deny the°possi-bility\\npossibility of treating perception in psychology, and then our\\n\"purely objective science of psychology\" can be nothing\\nmore than a physiology; or, admitting it, we must admit\\nwhat follows directly from and upon it-self-consciousness.\\nSelf-consciousness is indeed a fact (I do not fear the word)\\nof experience, and must therefore find its treatment in°psy-chology\\npsychology.\\nBut this is not all. Not only does self-consciousness\\nappear as one of the stages of psychological experience, but\\nthe explanation of the simplest psychological fact-say one\\nof perception, or feeling, or impulse—involves necessary\\nreference to self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is°in-volved\\ninvolved in every simpler process, and no one of them can be\\nscientifically described or comprehended except as this°invo-lution\\ninvolution is brought out. In fact, their comprehension or°expla-nation\\nexplanation is simply bringing to light this implication of°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness within them. This would be the last thing that\\nthe upholders of self-consciousness as the final unity and\\nsynthesis, the absolute meaning of experience, could deny.\\nThe organic nature of self-consciousness being their thesis,\\nit must indeed reveal itself in, or rather constitute, each of\\nits members and phases. The very existence of any idea or\\nfeeling being ultimately its relation to self-consciousness,\\nwhat other account of it can be given except its organic\\nplacing in the system? If there be such an act as perception,\\na candid, careful examination of it, not of its logical°condi-tions\\nconditions, but of itself as matter of experienced fact, will reveal\\nwhat it is; and this revelation will be the declaration of its\\nrelation to that organic system which in its wholeness is\\nself-consciousness. We may then abstract from this relation,\\nwhich constitutes its very being, and consider it as an object\\nof perception, and, generalizing the case, produce a°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy of nature; or, considering it as conditioned by thought,\\nwe may thus produce a logic. But both of these proceedings\\ngo on in abstraction from its real being, and cannot give the\\nreal method of philosophy. In short, the real esse of things is\\nneither their percipi, nor their intelligi alone; it is their\\nexperiri. Logic may give us the science of the intelligi, the\\nphilosophy of nature of the percipi, but only psychology can\\n\\n ― 152 ―\\n                            \\ngive us the systematic connected account of the experiri,\\nwhich is also in its wholeness just the°experior—self-con-sciousness\\nexperior—self-consciousness itself.\\nWe may see how the matter stands by inquiring what\\nwould be the effect upon philosophy if self-consciousness\\nwere not an experienced fact, i.e., if it were not one actual\\nstage in that realization of the universe by an individual\\nwhich is defined as constituting the sphere of psychology.\\nThe result would be again, precisely, that no such thing as\\nphilosophy, under any theory of its nature whatever, is\\npossible. Philosophy, it cannot be too often repeated,°con-sists\\nconsists simply in viewing things sub specie æternitatis or in\\nordine ad universum. If man, as matter of fact, does not\\nrealize the nature of the eternal and the universal within\\nhimself, as the essence of his own being; if he does not as\\none stage of his experience consciously, and in all stages\\nimplicitly, lay hold of this universal and eternal, then it is\\nmere matter of words to say that he can give no account of\\nthings as they universally and eternally are. To deny,°there-fore\\ntherefore, that self-consciousness is a matter of psychological\\nexperience is to deny the possibility of any philosophy.\\nWhat the denial comes to we have had historically\\ndemonstrated in Kant. He admits perception and conception\\nas matters of experience, but he draws the line at self-\\nconsciousness. It is worth noticing that his reason for denying\\nit is not psychological at all, but logical. It is not because\\nself-consciousness is not a fact, but because it cannot be a\\nfact according to his logical presuppositions. The results\\nfollowing the denial are worthy of notice as corresponding\\nexactly to what we might be led to expect: first, with the\\ndenial of the fact of self-consciousness comes the°impossibil-ity\\nimpossibility of solving the problem of philosophy, expressed in the\\nsetting up of an unknown thing-in-itself as the ultimate\\nground and condition of experience; and, secondly, comes\\nthe failure to bring perception and conception into any°or-ganic\\norganic connection with experience, that is, the failure to\\nreally comprehend and explain them, manifested in the°limi-tation\\nlimitation of both perception, through the forms of space and\\ntime, and thinking, through the categories, to phenomena\\nwhich are in no demonstrable connection with reality. The\\n\\n ― 153 ―\\n                            \\nfailure to recognize self-consciousness as a stage of°psycho-logical\\npsychological experience leads not only to a failure to reach the\\nalternate synthesis of experience, but renders it impossible\\nto explain the simpler forms of psychological experience.\\nThis failure of Kant teaches us another lesson also, in that,\\nas already stated, it was due to abandoning his real method,\\nwhich was psychological, consisting in the self-knowledge of\\nreason as an organic system by reason itself, and setting up\\na logical standard (in this latter case the principles of non-\\ncontradiction and identity), by which to determine the°total-ity\\ntotality of experience. The work of Hegel consisted essentially in\\nshowing that Kant\\'s logical standard was erroneous, and\\nthat, as matter of logic, the only true criterion or standard\\nwas the organic notion, or Begriff, which is a systematic\\ntotality, and accordingly able to explain both itself and also\\nthe simpler processes and principles. That Hegel°accom-plished\\naccomplished this work successfully and thoroughly there can be\\nto the writer no doubt; but it seems equally clear that the\\nwork of Kant is in need of another complement, following\\nmore closely his own conception of method and of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, which shall consist in showing self-consciousness as a\\nfact of experience, as well as perception through organic\\nforms and thinking through organic principles. And it\\nseems further that, only when this has been done, will, for\\nthe first time, the presuppositions latent in the work of\\nHegel, which give it its convincing force and validity, be\\nbrought out.\\nAgain, it seems worthy of note, that the late Professor\\nGreen (of whom the writer would not speak without°ex-pressing\\nexpressing his deep, almost reverential gratitude), when°fol-lowing\\nfollowing out Kant\\'s work from its logical side, hardly escaped\\nKant\\'s negative results. (By Kant\\'s logical method we mean\\nthe inquiry into the necessary conditions of experience; by\\nhis psychological method the inquiry into the actual nature\\nof experience.) After his complete demonstration of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness as the final condition, synthesis and unity of all\\nthat is or is knowable, he finds himself obliged to state\\n(Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, p. 54): \"As to what that\\nconsciousness in itself or in its completeness is, we can only\\nmake negative statements. That there is such a°conscious-ness\\n ― 154 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness is implied in the existence of the world; but what it is\\nwe can only know through its so far acting in us as to enable\\nus, however partially and interruptedly, to have knowledge\\nof a world or an intelligent experience.\" Had he begun from\\nthe latter statement, and shown as matter of fact that this\\nuniversal consciousness had realized itself, though only\\npartially and interruptedly, in us, he certainly would have\\nbeen able to make very positive statements regarding it, and\\nwould also have furnished a basis in fact for his logical\\nmethod, which now seems to hang upon nothing but a unity\\nof which all that can be said is that it is a unity, and that it is\\nnot anything in particular. When one reflects that it is not\\nonly upon the existence of this unity, but upon its working in\\nand through us, that all philosophy and philosophizing°de-pend\\ndepend, one cannot conceal the apprehension that too great a\\nload of philosophy has been hung upon too feeble a peg.\\nSo, too, after his victorious demonstration that upon\\nthe existence of this spiritual unity depends the possibility of\\nall moral experience, he finds himself obliged to state\\n(Green, p. 180), with that candor so characteristic of all his\\nthinking: \"Of a life of completed development, of activity\\nwith the end attained, we can only speak or think in°nega-tives\\nnegatives, and thus only can we speak or think of that state of\\nbeing in which, according to our theory, the ultimate moral\\ngood must consist.\" Once more, had he started from the fact\\nthat as matter of actual realization this absolute good has\\nbeen reproduced in our lives and the end attained (for surely\\nthe good is a matter of quality and not of quantity, and the\\nend a power, not a sum), he would not have found himself in\\nthis difficulty. But with a purely logical method, one can end\\nonly with the must be or the ought: the is vanishes, because\\nit has been abstracted from. The psychological method\\nstarts from the is, and thereby also gives the basis and the\\nideal for the ought and must be.\\nBut it is time that we returned to our thesis, which, in\\nbrief, was that no distinction which maintains that°psychol-ogy\\npsychology is the science of man as \"part of this partial world\" can\\nbe maintained. The following reasons for this denial have\\nbeen given: it was pointed out that the relative validity\\nwhich this distinction in man\\'s nature undoubtedly possesses\\n\\n ― 155 ―\\n                            \\nis itself the product and manifestation of psychological°expe-rience\\nexperience; that man as man, or as the conscious experience\\nwhose science is psychology, is self-conscious, and that\\ntherefore self-consciousness as the unity of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, not as \"purely objective,\" as the totality, not as a\\n\"part,\" must be included in the science of psychology; and\\nthat furthermore this treatment of self-consciousness is°nec-essary\\nnecessary for the explanation and comprehension of any partial\\nfact of conscious experience. And finally, it was pointed out\\nthat the denial of self-consciousness as constituting matter of\\nexperience, and hence of psychology, was the denial of the\\npossibility of philosophy itself; and this was illustrated by\\nhistoric examples. Before passing on to the second topic, I\\nwish briefly to return to Professor Caird\\'s exposition, and\\nshelter myself somewhat beneath the wings of his authority.\\nIn the article already referred to, he goes on to state that the\\nnatural objective science of man after all \"omits the°distinc-tive\\ndistinctive characteristic of man\\'s being\"; that while we may treat\\ninorganic nature and even organic with purely natural°objec-tive\\nobjective methods and principles, because \"they are not unities\\nfor themselves, but only for us,\" such treatment cannot be\\napplied to man, for man is for himself, i.e., is not a pure\\nobject, but is self-consciousness. Thus, he continues (Caird,\\n\"Metaphysic,\" p. 89):\\n\\nIn man, in so far as he is self-conscious—and it is self-\\nconsciousness that makes him man—the unity through which all\\nthings are and are known is manifested. . . . Therefore to treat\\nhim as a simply natural being is even more inaccurate and°mis-leading\\nmisleading than to forget or deny his relation to nature altogether.\\nA true psychology must avoid both errors: it must conceive man\\nas at once spiritual and natural; it must find a reconciliation of\\nfreedom and necessity. It must face all the difficulties involved in\\nthe conception of the absolute principle of self-consciousness—\\nthrough which all things are and are known—as manifesting\\nitself in the life of a being like man, who \"comes to himself\" only\\nby a long process of development out of the unconsciousness of\\na merely animal existence.\\n\\nWhen it is stated, later on, that the natural science of man\\n\"is necessarily abstract and imperfect, as it omits from its\\n\\n ― 156 ―\\n                            \\nview the central fact in the life of the object of which it\\ntreats\" (Caird, \"Metaphysic,\" p. 92), it is hardly worth\\nwhile discussing whether there be any such science or not.\\nBut there is suggested for us in the quotation just made our\\nsecond problem-the final relation of psychology, which°con-fessedly\\nconfessedly must deal with self-consciousness, to philosophy.\\nFor there the problem of psychology was stated to be the\\nquestion of the \"absolute principle of self-consciousness,\\nmanifesting itself in the life of a being like man.\" That is, it\\nis here suggested that psychology does not deal with the\\nabsolute principle in itself, but only with the modes by\\nwhich this is manifested or realized in the life of man.\\nPsychology no longer appears as an objective science; it now\\ncomes before us as a phenomenology, presupposing a°sci-ence\\nscience of the absolute reality itself. It is to this question that I\\nnow turn. Is psychology the science merely of the°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of the Absolute, or is it the science of the Absolute\\nitself?\\nII.\\n\\nThe relation of Psychology to Philosophy now stands,\\nI suppose, something like this:-There is an absolute self-\\nconsciousness. The science of this is philosophy. This°abso-lute\\nabsolute self-consciousness manifests itself in the knowing and\\nacting of individual men. The science of this manifestation,\\na phenomenology, is psychology. The distinction is no\\nlonger concerned with man\\'s being itself; it is a distinction\\nof treatment, of ways of looking at the same material. Before\\ngoing to its positive consideration the following questions\\nmay suggest the result we desire to reach. How does there\\ncome about this distinction between the \"spiritual\" and the\\n\"natural,\" between \"freedom\" and \"necessity\"? How does\\nthere come into our knowledge the notion of a distinction\\nbetween the \"absolute principle of self-consciousness\" and\\n\"man coming to himself only by a long process of°de-velopment\\ndevelopment out of the unconsciousness of a merely animal\\nexistence\"? Is this a distinction which falls outside the°sub-ject\\nsubject-matter of psychology, and which may therefore be used\\nto determine it; or is it one which has originated within\\n ― 157 ―\\n                            \\npsychological experience, and whose nature therefore,°in-stead\\ninstead of being capable of fixing the character of psychology,\\nmust itself be determined by psychology? Furthermore,\\nwhat is this distinction between the absolute°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness and its manifestation in a being like man? Is the°abso-lute\\nabsolute self-consciousness complete in itself, or does it involve\\nthis realization and manifestation in a being like man? If it is\\ncomplete in itself, how can any philosophy which is limited\\nto \"this absolute principle of self-consciousness\" face and\\nsolve the difficulties involved in its going beyond itself to\\nmanifest itself in self-consciousness? This cannot be what is\\nmeant. The absolute self-consciousness must involve within\\nitself, as organic member of its very being and activity, this\\nmanifestation and revelation. Its being must be this°realiza-tion\\nrealization and manifestation. Granted that this realization and\\nmanifestation is an act not occurring in time, but eternally\\ncompleted in the nature of the Absolute, and that it occurs\\nonly \"partially\" and \"interruptedly\" through (not in) time,\\nin a being like man,—the fact none the less remains that\\nphilosophy, under any theory of its nature, can deal with\\nthis absolute self-consciousness only so far as it has partially\\nand interruptedly realized itself in man. For man, as object\\nof his philosophy, this Absolute has existence only so far as\\nit has manifested itself in his conscious experience. To°re-turn\\nreturn to our questions: If the material of philosophy be the\\nabsolute self-consciousness, and this absolute°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness is the realization and manifestation of itself, and as\\nmaterial for philosophy exists only in so far as it has realized\\nand manifested itself in man\\'s conscious experience, and if\\npsychology be the science of this realization in man, what\\nelse can philosophy in its fulness be but psychology, and\\npsychology but philosophy?\\nThese questions are stated only to suggest the end\\nwhich we shall endeavor to reach. I shall not attempt to\\nanswer them directly, but to consider first the relations of\\nPsychology to Science, and hence to Philosophy; and°sec-ondly\\nsecondly to Logic.\\n1. THE RELATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO SCIENCE.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology is the completed method of philosophy, because\\n\\n ― 158 ―\\n                            \\nin it science and philosophy, fact and reason, are one.°Phi-losophy\\nPhilosophy seems to stand in a double relation to Science. In\\nits first aspect it is a science-the highest of all sciences. We\\ntake one sphere of reality and ask certain questions°regard-ing\\nregarding it, and the answers give us some one science; we find in\\nthe process that this sphere of reality can only artificially be\\nthus isolated, and we broaden and deepen our question, until\\nfinally, led by the organic connection of science with science,\\nwe ask after the nature of all reality, as one connected\\nsystem. The answer to this question constitutes philosophy\\nas one science amid the circle of sciences. But to continue to\\nregard it in this way is to fail to grasp the meaning of the\\nprocess which has forced us into philosophy. At the same\\ntime that philosophy is seen as the completion of the°sci-ences\\nsciences, it is seen as their basis. It is no longer a science; it is\\nScience. That is to say, the same movement of thought and\\nreality which forces upon us the conception of a science\\nwhich shall deal with the totality of reality forces us to\\nrecognize that no one of our previous sciences was in strict\\ntruth science. Each abstracted from certain larger aspects\\nof reality, and was hence hypothetical. Its truth was°condi-tioned\\nconditioned upon the truth of its relations to that whole which\\nthat science, as special science, could not investigate without\\ngiving up its own independent existence. Only in this whole\\nis categorical truth to be found, and only as categorical truth\\nis found in this whole is the basis found for the special\\nsciences. Philosophy as the science of this whole appears no\\nlonger therefore as a science, but as all Science taken in its\\norganic systematic wholeness,—not merely to which every\\nso-called special science is something subordinate, but of\\nwhich it constitutes an organic member. Philosophy has no\\nexistence except as the organic living unity and bond of\\nthese sciences; they have no existence except through their\\nposition in this living synthesis.\\nNow the question is, where does psychology stand\\nwithin this organism? On the one hand, psychology is°cer-tainly\\ncertainly a positive science. It finds its materials in certain facts\\nand events. As to systematic observation, experiment,°con-clusion\\nconclusion and verification, it can differ in no essential way\\nfrom any one of them. It is based upon and deals with fact,\\n\\n ― 159 ―\\n                            \\nand aims at the ordered comprehension and explanation of\\nfact as any special science does. Yet the whole drift of this\\npaper has been to show that in some way psychology does\\ndiffer very essentially from any one of them. Where shall we\\nfind this difference? In one word, its relation to them is\\nprecisely that which we have discovered philosophy to bear:\\nit is not only a science, but it turns out to be science as an\\norganic system, in which every special science has its life,\\nand from which it must abstract when it sets up for an\\nindependent existence of its own. We begin with any special\\nscience. That turns out to be not only some one department\\nor sphere of reality, but also some one department of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. From one science to another we go,°ask-ing\\nasking for some explanation of conscious experience, until we\\ncome to psychology, which gives us an account of it, in its\\nown behalf, as neither mathematics, nor physics, nor biology\\ndoes. So far we have only a special science, though the\\nhighest and most concrete of all. But the very process that\\nhas made necessary this new science reveals also that each of\\nthe former sciences existed only in abstraction from it. Each\\ndealt with some one phase of conscious experience, and for\\nthat very reason could not deal with the totality which gave\\nit its being, consciousness. But in psychology we have the\\nmanifestation and explication of this consciousness. It gives\\nin its wholeness what each of them would give in part, viz.,\\nthe nature of experience, and hence is related to them as the\\nwhole is to the part. It appears no longer, therefore, as the\\nhighest of sciences: it appears as Science itself, that is, as\\nsystematic account and comprehension of the nature of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. Mathematics, physics, biology exist,°be-cause\\nbecause conscious experience reveals itself to be of such a\\nnature, that one may make virtual abstraction from the\\nwhole, and consider a part by itself, without damage, so\\nlong as the treatment is purely scientific, that is, so long as\\nthe implicit connection with the whole is left undisturbed,\\nand the attempt is not made to present this partial science as\\nmetaphysic, or as an explanation of the whole, as is the usual\\nfashion of our uncritical so-called \"scientific philosophies.\"\\nNay more, this abstraction of some one sphere is itself a\\nliving function of the psychologic experience. It is not\\n\\n ― 160 ―\\n                            \\nmerely something which it allows: it is something which it\\ndoes. It is the analytic aspect of its own activity, whereby it\\ndeepens and renders explicit, realizes its own nature; just as\\ntheir connection with each other is the synthetic aspect of\\nthe same self-realizing movement, whereby it returns to\\nitself: while psychology in its completeness is the whole\\nself-developing activity itself, which shows itself as the°or-ganic\\norganic unity of both synthetic and analytic movements, and\\nthus the condition of their possibility and ground of their\\nvalidity. The analytic movement constitutes the special°sci-ences\\nsciences; the synthetic constitutes the philosophy of nature; the\\nself-developing activity itself, as psychology, constitutes°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy.\\nWhat other position can be given psychology, so soon\\nas we recognize the absurdity and impossibility of°consider-ing\\nconsidering it a purely objective science? It is the science of the\\nmodes by which, in and through the individual, the universe\\nis realized, it is said. But that the universe has no existence\\nexcept as absolutely realized in an individual, i.e., except as\\nself-consciousness, is precisely the result of philosophy, and\\ncan therefore be no objection to such a consideration of the\\nuniverse: in fact, such a statement only amounts to saying\\nthat psychology considers the universe as it really is. If the\\nassertion is varied again, to read that philosophy treats of\\nthis individualized universe as it eternally is, while°psychol-ogy\\npsychology can treat of it only as it partially and interruptedly\\nbecomes, this loses sight of two very important facts. First,\\nphilosophy can treat of absolute self-consciousness only in so\\nfar as it has become in a being like man, for otherwise it is\\nnot material for philosophy at all; and, secondly, it falls into\\nthe error of regarding this realization in man as a°time-con-ditioned\\ntime-conditioned product, which it is not. Time is not something\\noutside of the process of conscious experience; it is a form\\nwithin it, one of the functions by which it organically°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes its own being. In fact, psychology as philosophic\\nmethod has an immense advantage at just this point over\\nany other method of treating this problem. To any°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy attempting to consider the absolute self-consciousness\\nby itself, it must remain for ever an insoluble problem why\\nthe is should ever appear as becoming, why the eternal\\n\\n ― 161 ―\\n                            \\nshould ever appear through the temporal. Psychology solves\\nthe problem by avoiding the assumption which makes it a\\nproblem. For, dealing with an individualized universe, one\\nof whose functions of realization is time, it knows nothing\\nabout any consciousness which is out of relation to time. The\\ncase is just here: if philosophy will deal with the absolute\\nconsciousness conceived as purely eternal, out of relation to\\ntime, then the existence of that which constitutes the actual\\ncontent of man\\'s experience is utterly inexplicable; it is not\\nonly a mystery, but a mystery which contradicts the very\\nnature of that which is, ex hypothesi, the absolute. If°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy does deal with the eternal absolute consciousness as\\nfor ever realized, yet as for ever having time as one of its\\norganic functions, it is not open to any one to bring charges\\nagainst psychology as philosophy, for this and no more\\npsychology does.\\nThe question just comes to this: If we start from\\nreason alone we shall never reach fact. If we start with fact,\\nwe shall find it revealing itself as reason. The objection to an\\naccount of fact or experience as philosophy is but a°preju-dice\\nprejudice, though historically considered a well-grounded one. On\\nthe one hand, it has arisen because some partial account of\\nexperience, or rather account of partial experience, has been\\nput forth as the totality, and just because thus put forth as\\nabsolute has lost even the relative validity which it possessed\\nas partial. Such is the procedure of Empiricism. On the\\nother hand, we have had put forth as matter of fact certain\\ntruths declared to be immediate and necessary and intuitive,\\ncoming no one knows whence and meaning no one knows\\nwhat. The aversion to immediacy, to \"undeduced\" fact, as\\ngiven us by the Intuitionalists, is certainly a well-grounded\\none. But neither of these objections lies against psychology\\nas account of the facts of experience. Men are mortal, and\\nevery actual account of experience will suffer from the°de-fects\\ndefects of mortals, and be but partial, no doubt; unfortunately\\nwe are none of us omniscient yet. But the very essence of\\npsychology as method is that it treats of experience in its\\nabsolute totality, not setting up some one aspect of it to\\naccount for the whole, as, for example, our physical°evolu-tionists\\nevolutionists do, nor yet attempting to determine its nature from\\n\\n ― 162 ―\\n                            \\nsomething outside of and beyond itself, as, for example, our\\nso-called empirical psychologists have done. The vice of the\\nprocedure of both is at bottom precisely the same-the°ab-stracting\\nabstracting of some one element from the organism which\\ngives it meaning, and setting it up as absolute. It is no\\nwonder that the organism always has its revenge by°pro-nouncing\\npronouncing this abstracted element \"unknowable.\" The only\\nwonder is that men should still bow in spirit before this\\ncreation of their own abstracting thought, and reverence it\\nas the cause and ground of all reality and knowledge. There\\nis indeed an anthropomorphism which is degrading, but it is\\nthe anthropomorphism which sets up the feeblest element of\\nits own thinking, pure being, as Mr. Spencer does, or the\\npoorest element of its own feeling, a sensation, and°rever-ences\\nreverences that as its own and the universe\\'s cause. That is the\\nanthropomorphism of the enslaved thought which has not\\nyet awakened to the consciousness of its own totality and\\nspiritual freedom.\\nNor does the account of fact given by psychology have\\nanything in common with the \"ultimate, inexplicable,°neces-sary\\nnecessary\" mental facts called intuitions. The fact of psychology\\nreveals itself as precisely reason, which thereby accounts for\\nitself, and in accounting for itself accounts for all its°mem-bers\\nmembers. The fact of psychology is not isolated \"truths,\" but the\\norganic system of self-consciousness. This fact is indeed\\n\"immediate,\" but it is immediate only in and through a\\nprocess, hence of mediation. It is indeed self-evidencing, but\\nwhat it evidences is simply, of the parts, relation to and\\ndependence upon the whole, and of the whole, that it is\\nself-conditioned and self-related. Of the whole fact it may be\\nsaid indeed that it is inexplicable. \"It is true that we cannot\\nexplain the spiritual principle which is implied in all°experi-ence\\nexperience by reference to anything else than itself.\" Prof. E. Caird, Mind, vol. viii, p. 560.\\n»2 \"Because\\nall we can experience is included in this one world, and all\\nour inferences and explanations relate only to its details,\\nneither it as a whole, nor the one consciousness which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes it, can be accounted for in the ordinary sense of the\\nword. They cannot be accounted for by what they include;\\n\\n ― 163 ―\\n                            \\nand being all-inclusive, there remains nothing else by which\\nthey can be accounted for.\" Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, p. 52.\\n»3 In short, any system of°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy must ultimately fall back on the fact for which no\\nreason can be given except precisely just that it is what it is.\\nThis implication of fact The insistence upon this seems to have been Lotze\\'s great work as\\na philosopher.\\n»4 is latent in all philosophy°what-ever\\nwhatever, and all that psychology as philosophic method does is\\nto render this necessary implication explicit. It alone starts\\nfrom the completed fact, and it alone is therefore completed\\nphilosophy.\\nIf it may have seemed at times in the course of the\\ndiscussion that the nominal subject—the relation of°psychol-ogy\\npsychology to science-had been left, it will now appear, I think,\\nthat we have all the time been dealing with just that subject.\\nScience is the systematic account, or reason of fact;°Psychol-ogy\\nPsychology is the completed systematic account of the ultimate fact,\\nwhich, as fact, reveals itself as reason, and hence accounts\\nfor itself, and gives the \"reasons\" of all sciences. The other\\npoint, the relation of psychology to logic, has already been\\ndealt with by implication, and need not detain us long again.\\n2. THE RELATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO LOGIC. The whole\\ncourse of philosophic thought, so far as the writer can°com-prehend\\ncomprehend it, has consisted in showing that any distinction\\nbetween the form and the matter of philosophic truth,°be-tween\\nbetween the content and the method, is fatal to the reaching of\\ntruth. Self-consciousness is the final truth, and in°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness the form as organic system and the content as\\norganized system are exactly equal to each other. It is a\\nprocess which, as form, has produced itself as matter.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology as the account of this self-consciousness must°neces-sarily\\nnecessarily fulfil all the conditions of true method. Logic, since it\\nnecessarily abstracts from the ultimate fact, cannot reach in\\nmatter what it points to in form. While its content, if it be\\ntrue philosophy, must be the whole content of°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness or spirit, its form is only one process within this°con-tent\\ncontent, that of thought-conditions, the Idee. While the content\\nis the eternal nature of the universe, its form is adequate\\n\\n ― 164 ―\\n                            \\nonly to \"thinking what God thought and was before the\\ncreation of the world,\" that is, the universe in its unreality,\\nin its abstraction. It is this contradiction between content\\nand form in logic which makes it not philosophic method,\\nbut only one moment within that method. No contradiction\\nresults as soon as logic is given its proper place within the\\nsystem. The contradiction occurs when, at the same moment\\nthat it is said that logic is \"abstract,\" the logical method is\\nstill said to be the method of philosophy.\\nSuch contradictions certainly appear to exist, for°exam-ple\\nexample, in the philosophy of Hegel. They have been often\\npointed out, and I shall only summarize them, following for\\nthe most part a recent writer. Prof. A. Seth, \"Hegel: an Exposition and Criticism,\" Mind, vol. vi.\\n»5 There is no way of getting\\nfrom logic to the philosophy of nature logically. The only\\nway is to fall back upon the fact; \"we know from°experi-ence\\nexperience\" that we have nature as well as the Idee. In truth we do\\nnot go from logic to nature at all. The movement is a reverse\\nmovement. \"In reality, the necessity for any such transition\\nis purely factitious, because the notions never existed°other-wise\\notherwise than in nature and spirit. . . . They were got by\\nabstraction from the concrete. . . . We owe, therefore, no\\napology for a return to the reality from which we took\\nthem.\" In short, it is necessity of fact, a necessity of°con-scious\\nconscious experience, which takes us from the realm of the Idee\\nto the realm of nature, from the sphere of thought-conditions\\nto the sphere of existent relations. \"The same is true when\\nwe pass to the philosophy of spirit. The general form of\\npersonality is deducible, but not a living human spirit with\\nits individual thoughts, feelings and actions.\" This remains\\n\"the incomprehensible and inexplicable point in°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy.\" And so it does undoubtedly while we regard logic as\\nmethod of philosophy. But this \"inexplicability\" is but the\\nexpress condemnation of the method, not a fact to be°con-tented\\ncontented with. If we go deeper and inquire not how is the\\ntransition from logic to the philosophy of nature or to the\\nphilosophy of spirit made, but how is any transition°what-ever\\nwhatever possible, we find the same difficulty. It exists only by\\nreason of the presupposed fact. \"We cannot in strictness say\\n\\n ― 165 ―\\n                            \\nthat the result has been independently proved, because it has\\nbeen reached in this fashion by the method. It was°presup-posed\\npresupposed in the method all along.\" In a definite case, how is the\\ntransition, say from the category of quality to that of°quan-tity\\nquantity, made? It occurs not by virtue of the category of quality\\nin itself, but by virtue of the fact that the whole Idee is\\nimplicitly contained in the principle of quality, and must\\nmanifest itself, which it does by forcing quality, as an°inade-quate\\ninadequate expression of its own nature, into quantity, which°ex-presses\\nexpresses its being more fully. And thus the process continues\\nuntil the Idee has manifested itself as the whole organic\\nsystem, which has expressed explicitly all that which in Idee\\nit is. But this movement itself depends on spirit, and on the\\nmanifestation of spirit in nature, as already seen. Every\\npurely logical transition therefore occurs at bottom because\\nof fact, i.e., seen in its wholeness it is not a logical transition\\nbut a factual. Psychology, as philosophic method, merely\\nstarts from this everywhere presupposed fact, and by so\\ndoing, for the first time, gives logic its basis and validity.\\nThere can be no escape from this result by saying that\\nafter all in the philosophy of spirit, spirit is shown to be the\\nprius and condition of the whole, as it undoubtedly is by\\nHegel himself. This merely brings the contradiction itself\\ninto clearer light. For logic, being thus confessedly°deter-mined\\ndetermined as abstract, is still retained to determine the nature of\\nthe concrete. Logic, while it is thus declared to be only one\\nmoment of spirit, is still used to determine the nature of the\\nwhole. Thus is revealed the contradiction between form and\\ncontent involved in the use of logic as the method of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy. Spirit is reached by a logical process, and the logical\\nresult is that as fact it is not reached at all. As concrete, it is\\nbeyond the reach of any abstract process. Either one must\\ncall in the aid of the presupposed but suppressed Fact, and\\nrecognize that after all the process has been going on within\\na further and higher determination; or, failing to see this,\\nmust recognize Spirit as only one factor or moment of the\\nlogical movement, that is, give up the notion of°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness as subject, and fall back into Spinozistic°panthe-ism\\npantheism. The logical movement, considered by itself, is always\\nbalancing in unstable equilibrium between dualism and.\\n\\n ― 166 ―\\n                            \\npantheism. Set up as absolute method, it either recognizes\\nthe fact, but being unable to comprehend it, has to regard\\nthis fact, as foreign element over against it, as the matter of\\nPlato and Aristotle, the thing-in-itself of Kant, and Anstoss\\nof Fichte, The inability to go from the \"because\" of reason to the \"cause\" of\\nfact, from logic to reality, when logic is not taken simply as one movement\\nwithin reality, is clearly set forth in the closing chapters of Mr. Bradley\\'s\\nPrinciples of Logic.\\n»6 or endeavors to absorb the Fact as a mere element\\nin its own logical being, and falls into Pantheism.\\nThis is the reason why Hegel, although the very centre\\nof his system is self-conditioned spirit, lends himself so\\neasily to pantheistic treatment. Logic cannot reach, however\\nmuch it may point to, an actual individual. The gathering\\nup of the universe into the one self-conscious individuality it\\nmay assert as necessary, it cannot give it as reality. It is only\\nas logic contradicts itself and faces back on the constant\\npresupposition of this reality that it can demonstrate what it\\nasserts. Taken purely by itself it must issue in a pantheism\\nwhere the only real is the Idee, and where all its factors and\\nmoments, including spirit and nature, are real only at°differ-ent\\ndifferent stages or phases of the Idee, but vanish as imperfect\\nways of looking at things, or as illusions, when we reach the\\nIdee. And thus the Idee itself vanishes, as an organic°sys-tem\\nsystem, as a unity which lives through its distinctions, and\\nbecomes a dead identity, in no way distinguishable from the\\nsubstance of Spinoza. Logic set up as absolute method°re-veals\\nreveals its self-contradiction by destroying itself. In a purely\\nlogical method the distinctions, the process must disappear\\nin the final unity, the product. Only a living actual Fact can\\npreserve within its unity that organic system of differences\\nin virtue of which it lives and moves and has its being. It is\\nwith this fact, conscious experience in its entirety, that°psy-chology\\npsychology as method begins. It thus brings to clear light of\\nday the presupposition implicit in every philosophy, and\\nthereby affords logic, as well as the philosophy of nature, its\\nbasis, ideal and surety. If we have determined the nature of\\nreality, by a process whose content equals its form, we can\\nshow the meaning, worth and limits of any one moment of\\nthis reality.\\nThe conclusion of the whole matter is that a \"being\\n\\n ― 167 ―\\n                            \\nlike man,\" since self-conscious, is an individualized°uni-verse\\nuniverse, and hence that his nature is the proper material of\\nphilosophy, and in its wholeness the only material.°Psychol-ogy\\nPsychology is the science of this nature, and no dualism in it, or in\\nways of regarding it, is tenable. Whatever the dualism may\\nbe, it is only relative, and one which occurs within, not\\nwithout, psychological experience. Psychology, as the°com-plete\\ncomplete systematic account of man, at the same time shows the\\nvalue and meaning, and affords the condition, of the special\\nsciences, the philosophy of nature and of logic. Or, in a\\nword, if the reality of spirit be the presupposition, the prius\\nand the goal, the condition and the end of all reality, the\\nscience of spirit must occupy a corresponding position with\\nrelation to all science. Surely then, as the editor of this\\njournal formerly urged, \"the method of psychological°ap-proach\\napproach is not philosophically valueless,\" and we have\\n\"ground for the belief that it has only to be more°systemati-cally\\nsystematically followed out for the attaining of as great results as\\nhave been claimed for another way, while in this way the\\nresults are more likely to secure general acceptance,\" George Croom Robertson, \"Psychology and Philosophy,\" Mind, vol.\\nviii, p. 20.\\n»7—°be-cause\\nbecause, we may add, it simply expresses in a scientific way\\nthat which lies at the basis of all that has been otherwise\\nsecured.\\n\\n ― 168 ―\\n                            \\n\"Illusory Psychology\" [First published in Mind, XII (Jan. 1887), 83-88.

XI (Oct. 1886): 478-94  (print edition, pp. xli-lvii).]\\n»*\\nThe fact that so acute and experienced a philosophical\\nthinker as Mr. Shadworth Hodgson has misapprehended the\\nbearing of the articles by me [pp. 122-43 and 144-67]\\nmust be my excuse for again troubling the readers with\\nreference to the matters discussed there. Mr. Hodgson\\nseems to think that it was the object of one to explain the\\nnature of the individual and the universal consciousness, and\\nof the other to give some definite directions regarding the\\napplication of method to philosophy and psychology. Thus\\napprehending them, he quite naturally complains of the\\n\"blanks\" in the argument; and, if I may judge from the tone\\nof his remarks, thinks, indeed, that there is not so much an\\nargument as an assumption, while my lack of logic is to him\\nlamentable. May I be allowed to state that I had no such\\nends in view, and that what seems to Mr. Hodgson a lack of\\nlogic on my part seems to me a misunderstanding of logical\\nbearing on his part? The logical purpose of the first article\\nwas as follows: Granted the general truth of that way of\\nlooking at philosophical questions which is specifically°Eng-lish\\nEnglish (and which, following the usual custom, I called°psy-chological\\npsychological), (1) to determine whether some important°fac-tor\\nfactor has not been overlooked; (2) to show that it is involved\\nin this standpoint that all questions must be decided from\\ntheir place in conscious experience; (3) to show that this\\ngeneral statement applies to particular questions, like the\\nnature of subject and object, universal and individual; and\\n(4) to show that this in turn implies that the psychological\\nstandpoint is one which transcends and underlies the°distinc-tion\\ndistinction of subject and object, etc. Now it was open to Mr.\\nHodgson, or anyone else, to reply that I misinterpreted the\\nstandpoint of British philosophy; or that, while its°stand-point\\n ― 169 ―\\n                            \\nstandpoint was correctly stated, it involved no such implications\\nas I thought it did; or that while it did involve such°implica-tions\\nimplications, this fact is, at bottom, only a reductio ad absurdum of\\nthe standpoint. But objections like those of Mr. Hodgson,\\nwith all due deference, seem to me a huge ignoratio elenchi.\\nAnd his misunderstanding of the logical bearing of the\\nwhole has influenced his treatment of details. Mr. Hodgson\\'s\\naversion to some expressions is so acute that he seems hardly\\nto have asked himself in what connection these phrases are\\nused. If he will re-read certain pages of the article referred\\nto, I think he will see that the terms \"postulate\" and°\"pre-supposition\\n\"presupposition,\" whose use seems to him to involve a°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction on my part, are used not generally, nor with reference\\nto my own standpoint, but in connection with this°examina-tion\\nexamination of British philosophy, and that the contention of the\\narticle is, rather, that what has been an unconscious°presup-position\\npresupposition ought to be given a psychological examination and\\nposition.\\nSo the logical bearing of the second article was not to\\ngive recommendations regarding specific methods, but to\\nsuggest to those whom Mr. Hodgson calls my°\"Germanis-ing\\n\"Germanising friends\" that their results will never have a firm basis\\nuntil they are reached by a psychological method. The°arti-cle\\narticle was entitled \"Psychology as Philosophic Method,\" just\\nas Mr. Hodgson might call a portion of his article°\"Meta-physic\\n\"Metaphysic as Philosophic Method.\"\\nIt thus appears to me that the mass of Mr. Hodgson\\'s\\ndirect specific criticism is so beside the mark that it is\\nneedless to undertake a detailed review of it. But one may\\nalways learn much from Mr. Hodgson when he is positively\\npropounding his own views; and certain discussions, as,\\ne.g., regarding the nature of the universal and the°individ-ual\\nindividual, and the mutual connections of science, philosophy and\\npsychology, are never beside the mark. I should like briefly\\nto discuss the attempts which Mr. Hodgson kindly makes to\\nfill the \"blanks\" in my argument.\\nI.\\n\\nFirst, then, as to the relation of the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness, or, more properly speaking, of the\\n\\n ― 170 ―\\n                            \\nindividual and the universal in consciousness. The position\\nof Mr. Hodgson, as I understand it, is that I have not duly\\ndistinguished between perceptual processes, which give us\\nthe individual, and conceptual processes, which generalize it\\nand give us a result more or less abstract, and that°conse-quently\\nconsequently I have erected a generalized notion of my individual\\nconsciousness,—a logical abstraction into an actual ens,\\nwhich I call universal consciousness (pp. xliii and xlvii [print edition]).\\nThe real state of the case, we are to believe, is as follows:\\nThere is a \"stream of states and changes\" which comes to\\nevery individual; this is an individualized stream, and occurs\\nin perceptual order. Out of it the world of ordinary°experi-ence\\nexperience is built. But the individual can think as well as°per-ceive\\nperceive, and he comes gradually to generalize. This process of\\ngeneralization he extends even to his own consciousness; he\\ngeneralizes conscious experience itself. But the°generaliza-tion\\ngeneralization does not give, either in knowledge or belief, a universal\\nconsciousness different in any way from his own. It is\\nmerely the logical or conceptual way of representing°individ-uality\\nindividuality of what in actual experience is perceptual (pp. xliii\\nand xlvi [print edition]). A universal self can only be represented in\\nthought as an individual self indefinitely or infinitely°magni-fied\\nmagnified (p. xlix). The result is that, while we may speak of\\nuniversal knowledge, the content of consciousness, it is°falla-cious\\nfallacious and self-contradictory to speak of a universal knower,\\nthe agent or bearer of consciousness (pp. xlvii and xlviii [print edition]).\\nThe gist of the whole controversy is, that while we may and\\nmust assume individuality as given to us (pp. xlii, xlvi [print edition]),\\nuniversality is the result of a logical process. As to this I\\nhave to say:—\\n1. Mr. Hodgson is misled by an ambiguity in the use\\nof the term \"individual.\" In one sense (in which it cannot be\\nthe subject-matter of any science) it is given to us; in\\nanother (in the sense in which it is an object of scientific\\nknowledge) it is not given to us, but is a product of°psycho-logical\\npsychological experience. Every experience is given to us as a\\nunique experience, a fact of absolute and immediate interest.\\nIndividuality in this sense is indeed an assumption which we\\nneed not care to avoid. But this assumption is only the\\nassumption that a fact exists; it tells us nothing of the\\n\\n ― 171 ―\\n                            \\nmeaning of the fact. And it is the assumption that we know\\nat the outset, what individuality means, and that the°imme-diate\\nimmediate fact of experience is the same as an interpretation of\\nthe fact, which plays such havoc with Mr. Hodgson\\'s ideas.\\nIt is this assumption which enables him to slide°uncon-sciously\\nunconsciously from the immediate unique interest which°accompa-nies\\naccompanies every experience, and which makes it mine or thine, to\\nthe fact of individuality, as one being among others, limited\\nin space and time, and whose ideas occur as a \"stream.\"\\nIndividuality in this sense is not \"given,\" is not°\"immedi-ate\\n\"immediate,\" and is an assumption which we must avoid making\\nuntil we see what it means—until, in short, it is not an\\nassumption. Individuality in this sense may be provisionally\\nopposed to universality, but this sense is not an original or\\nimmediate dictum. It is a product which has come about\\nthrough experience, through psychological experience. The\\nprocess of its coming about, the way in which this gets to be\\na fact of our conscious experience, is something to be°exam-ined\\nexamined by psychology. The psychological standpoint is prior,\\nso to speak, to this result. It is confusion enough to°substi-tute\\nsubstitute this psychological product for the immediate°individual-ity\\nindividuality which is a matter of feeling, but to substitute a°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical interpretation of the fact is to carry the confusion a\\nstep further. And this Mr. Hodgson does in giving°individu-ality\\nindividuality a meaning—that is, an interpretation-which opposes it\\nabsolutely to universality. One thing which Mr. Hodgson\\nwould have learned by going to psychology rather than to\\nmetaphysics would be to avoid this threefold confusion of\\nthe individuality of immediate feeling, of constructed fact of\\nexperience and of philosophical interpretation of the fact.\\n2. The substitution appears, however, in a still worse\\nplight when we consider that this view of individuality\\nwhich opposes it absolutely to universality is an incorrect\\ninterpretation. I speak, not as a Germanizing°transcenden-talist\\ntranscendentalist, but according to my humble lights as a psychologist,\\nwhen I say that I know nothing of a perceptual order apart\\nfrom a conceptual, and nothing of an agent or bearer apart\\nfrom the content which it bears. As a psychologist, I see the\\npossibility of abstractly analyzing each from the other, and,\\nif I were as fond of erecting the results of an analysis into\\n\\n ― 172 ―\\n                            \\nreal entities as Mr. Hodgson believes me to be, I should\\nsuppose that they were actually distinct as concrete°exist-ences\\nexistences. But, sticking fast to what Psychology teaches me, I\\nmust hold that they are aspects, analytically arrived at, of\\nthe one existing reality-conscious experience. Mr. Hodgson\\nfinds no difficulty in making the separation. He assumes—\\nand speaking from the metaphysical standpoint would°natu-rally\\nnaturally assume—that there is \"a stream of changes and states\"\\nwhich \"come to an individual,\" and \"out of this as data is\\nbuilt up ordinary experience.\" So he regards this \"stream\"\\nas in some way individual, while the world built up out of it\\n—the content—may be distinguished from it. To me it seems\\nthat this \"stream\" is built up along with, and mostly out of,\\nthe experiences of the everyday world. Stream and world are\\nequally psychological constructions, built up by°psychologi-cal\\npsychological processes. It must be from Metaphysic (it cannot be\\nfrom Psychology) that Mr. Hodgson gets a \"stream\" which\\nis given ready-made. Psychology would tell us that the\\n\"stream\" is essentially due to projections out from the°pres-ent\\npresent by a psychological mechanism in the form of memory\\nand expectation. Consciousness is not a moving body, which,\\nflying through time, leaves a trail behind it, as does a rocket\\nin space. When the idea of an absent person is suggested to\\nan infant, the child does not conceive this as an idea, but\\nlooks about him to localize the person. His life is a present\\none, and it is only through a psychological development that\\nhe comes to have experiences placed as past and anticipated\\nas future. The experiences of time and of \"streams\" are due\\nto psychological dynamics. The process by which the°indi-vidual\\nindividual comes to connect certain experiences with himself as\\na being continuous in time, and to separate them from others\\nwhich he refers to existences in space, is one of the problems\\nof psychology. What is the bearing of all this? Simply, that\\nwe have no ready-made distinction between the individual\\nagent and the world of experience over against him, but that\\neach is built up out of a common material by°contempora-neous\\ncontemporaneous processes. A correct psychology would teach Mr.\\nHodgson, it seems to me, not only that the ordo ad°individ-uum\\nindividuum and the ordo ad universum are built out of a common\\nstock, but that the process is a reciprocal one, so that our\\n\\n ― 173 ―\\n                            \\nideas of ourselves as individuals, nay ourselves as°individu-als\\nindividuals, are made up out of our experiences of the world, and\\nvice versa. The agent is not the agent which it is without the\\ncontent, not only in the sense that it bears that content and\\nno other, but in the sense that this content reacts upon it and\\nis organized into it to make it what it specifically is. If Mr.\\nHodgson will make an absolute separation between the°indi-vidual\\nindividual as agent and the content of consciousness as general,\\nhe will find that all that is left to the agent is: x is°experi-enced\\nexperienced and is interesting, where it is impossible to give x any\\ndefinite values. Its analogies we may hypothetically find in\\nthe consciousness of an oyster.\\n3. And finally upon this point, I know of no perception\\nwhich is not made what it is by conceptual elements within\\nit. Mr. Hodgson well says that \"every act of attention to a\\npercept is the commencement of a generalisation\" (p. xliv [print edition]).\\nBut it cannot be possible that Mr. Hodgson supposes that\\nperceptions are given to us prior to attention, and that this is\\nan activity which supervenes, the perception once formed.\\nCorrect psychology seems to teach that the attention—the\\nactive connection between the mind and a given psychical\\ncomplex-is necessary to interpret, to make it a percept. And\\nunless there are two utterly different kinds of attention,\\ngeneralization must be thus introduced, and a universal\\nelement be present in the percept. I cannot believe°accord-ingly\\naccordingly that Mr. Hodgson\\'s attempt to set up individuality of\\nconsciousness as opposed to universality is successful,\\nwhether it proceeds by distinguishing the perceptual order\\nfrom the conceptual, or by distinguishing the stream of\\nconsciousness as given from the content of that°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness as interpreted. At all events, I hope it is clear that this\\nconception of universality of consciousness is not that of an\\nindividual indefinitely magnified. I should still be compelled\\nto ask, What is this individual which is magnified? and if I\\ndeal with facts and not with analytic abstractions, I find it to\\nbe bound up through and through with universal factors,\\nnay constituted by its relation to the universal factor. One\\nword more, and I have done with this point. The°universal-ity\\nuniversality of consciousness stands just where its individuality does.\\nAn individuality is \"given\" in the sense that every°con-sciousness\\n ― 174 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness has a unique interest; so universality is \"given\"\\nin the sense that every consciousness has a meaning. But the\\nexperience of the world as a fact, like the experience of the\\nindividual stream as a fact, is a constructed product. And\\nthe philosophical interpretation of the fact that there is a\\nworld of experience is still more remote from being°immedi-ate\\nimmediate or given. In each of these three stages it stands just\\nwhere individuality does.\\nII.\\n\\nI can treat but briefly of the other point: the relation\\nbetween Psychology and what Mr. Hodgson calls°Meta-physic\\nMetaphysic and what I called Logic. Mr. Hodgson seems to think\\nthat upon my theory no place can be left for physiological\\npsychology, for race-psychology, etc., etc. They would,\\nhowever, be left just where they are now-as special°meth-ods\\nmethods for determining the conditions and genesis of various\\nfactors in conscious experience.\\nWhen Mr. Hodgson says that Metaphysic abstracts\\nfrom the fact that consciousness is individually conditioned\\n(pp. liii and lv [print edition]) he simply suggests the point which was\\nuppermost in my mind when I wrote the article on°\"Psychol-ogy\\n\"Psychology as Philosophic Method.\" Metaphysic or Logic does\\nabstract from the individual, which conditions the content.\\nAs thus abstract, it cannot furnish the final method of°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy, for as abstract it makes an assumption and is°incom-plete\\nincomplete. It is incomplete; for is this unique and yet absolutely\\nuniversal fact that the content of consciousness is known\\nonly in and to an individual-is this fact to be left out of\\naccount? The play of Hamlet, with Hamlet left out seems to\\nme nothing in comparison. It makes an assumption, for to\\nmake assumptions is simply to see how facts look when some\\nintegral factor is omitted.\\nEnglish thought, according to Mr. Hodgson, has°com-monly\\ncommonly ignored the universal or all-embracing character of\\nthe consciousness, and has identified it with individual\\nbeing. So it seems to me, and the article [pp. 122-43] was\\nwritten to show that psychology could not be even°psychol-ogy\\npsychology, much less philosophy, until the universal factor in\\n\\n ― 175 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness was attended to. Transcendentalism, he says,\\ninclines to identify consciousness with universal being, and\\nif this be interpreted to mean that it inclines to neglect the\\nindividual agent, without which the universality of the°con-tent\\ncontent is naught, I heartily agree with him. The article [pp.\\n144-67] was written to show that transcendentalism was\\nincomplete till it recognized that the universal content can\\nbe realized only in an individual bearer. And I make bold to\\nadd that Mr. Hodgson thinks the two sides may be split, one\\nsurrendered to Psychology, the other reserved for°Meta-physic\\nMetaphysic; while to me it seems that we shall never get the\\nsurest footing and the completest results until we recognize\\nthat such halves—the individual without the universal°con-tent\\ncontent, and the universal content without the individual bearer\\n—are disjecta membra. The science which unites them, and\\nconsiders the content as realized in and by an individual, and\\nthe individual as realized through and by the content, seems\\nto me to be Psychology. A psychology which should attempt\\nto occupy the position Mr. Hodgson gives to it would have\\nnothing to say except—Here is a consciousness which°inter-ests\\ninterests me, but about which I can say nothing.\\n\\n ― 176 ―\\n                            \\nKnowledge as Idealization [First published in Mind, XII (July 1887), 382-96. Not reprinted\\nby the author.]\\n»*\\nThat the word \"idea,\" as commonly used, is about as°am-biguous\\nambiguous a term as could well be invented, is an old story. I\\nneed here to call attention only to two connotations. It°im-plies\\nimplies existence, and it implies meaning or the content of the\\npsychical existence. When we speak of the idea of virtue, we\\nmay mean either the \"idea conveyed\" by the term, its°signif-icance\\nsignificance, or we may mean the particular psychical existence,\\nwhich occurs now and here in experience, and stands for the\\nmeaning. But this double connotation is not confined to\\nabstract terms. It holds equally of the most definite°percep-tion\\nperception,—say, mine of my pen as I write. There is the idea \"in\\nmy mind,\" an existence coming after many ideas, and before\\nmany others; a psychical existence which is a unique,°un-shareable\\nunshareable, irrecoverable experience. What constitutes it we\\nneed not here inquire, though our psychological research\\ngoes to show that it is a clustering of sensations, visual,\\nmuscular and tactile, due to the immediate stimulation of\\nmy nervous system. Similar stimuli may occur again°doubt-less\\ndoubtless, but the present existence endures only while the given\\nstimulus is actually there. How stands it with the other\\nconnotation of the term? It is evident that here we are\\ndealing with meaning or significance—all that would be\\nincluded in the definition, say, of pen, plus the fact that it is\\nnow present, which is, after all, part of the meaning, and not\\nof the existence. To state the whole matter simply, every\\npsychical state or \"idea,\" in Locke\\'s sense, is at once°sensa-tion\\nsensation and interpretation of that sensation or meaning°con-veyed\\nconveyed. It is sign and signification. We do not go here into\\nthe theoretical justification of the latter element. We do not\\nask whether there is any pen really there, or whether, if there\\n\\n ― 177 ―\\n                            \\nis, our idea of it corresponds to reality. We merely state the\\nfact that in every psychical experience there is the psychical\\nexistence, and there is what this existence stands for to the\\nmind. It is an undoubted fact that the meaning seems to be\\nobjective, permanent and universal; that the idea of°exist-ence\\nexistence, in other words, seems to us to report a reality which is\\nthere, aside from our particular mental state, one which is\\nequally there for my intelligence at all times under the same\\nconditions and for all intelligences. This apparent report is\\npart of the complete psychical fact, but we do not now ask\\nwhether it has any right to be, or whether it is an illusion\\nunconsciously superadded to the legitimate content of the\\nfact. Recognizing that every psychical fact does have these\\ntwo aspects, we shall, for the present, confine ourselves to\\nasking the nature, function and origin of the aspect of°mean-ing\\nmeaning or significance—the content of the idea as opposed to its\\nexistence. In thus calling attention to the distinction of the two senses of the\\nterm \"idea,\" I am, of course, but repeating what many others have said\\n—among them most clearly Mr. F. H. Bradley, in his Principles of Logic,\\npp. 5 and 6.\\n»1\\nTo develop what is meant let us take Locke\\'s favorite\\nexample—a perception of gold. If we ask what is psychically\\npresent, by way of immediate existence, we shall find that it\\nis only a group of sensuous feelings—some strong, some\\nfaint. If we inquire further, we find that the stronger ones\\nare due to a direct stimulation of some organ of sense, while\\nthe fainter are due to the indirect stimulation of some central\\norgan. If we simply look at the piece of gold, there are the\\nvivid sensations of color and muscular tension only;°clus-tered\\nclustered about these may be less vivid feelings of contact,\\nperhaps of slight metallic taste and odor. But it is a mistake\\nto call these latter feelings ideal, and the former real. One\\nclass is just as real as the other; the only distinction is one of\\nstrength. It is quite true that the weaker feelings may be\\nfound upon examination to be due to previous stimulations,\\nand to be due to connections in the brain previously°estab-lished\\nestablished, so that now a direct peripheral excitation serves to set\\nup a change in some connected part of the brain and awaken\\nsensation. But as existences, there is no difference in the\\n\\n ― 178 ―\\n                            \\nfeelings, whether peripherally set up or centrally excited.\\nThe stronger one, as existence, does not report that it is due\\nto present direct stimulation; the weaker one does not report\\nthat it is ultimately due to past stimulations. This is a matter\\nof interpretation, and even as interpretation it does not enter\\ninto the perception of the gold. I repeat, as existence, we\\nhave only a clustering of sensuous feelings, stronger and\\nweaker.\\nBut what is perceived is not a clustering of feelings of\\nany sort. It has taken centuries of scientific psychological\\nobservation even to ascertain that sensations of these kinds\\nare involved at all: so far is their presence from being an\\nelement of the content of perception. What is perceived is\\nthe thing gold, with its various properties, which the°sensa-tions\\nsensations stand for. And in our anxiety to get at meaning, to find\\nout what is symbolized, we actually neglect utterly that\\nwhich is the symbol, the psychical existence. What is°per-ceived\\nperceived is, in short, significance, meaning. The amount of\\nperception one has, whether as a babe or adult, as layman,\\nor as chemist, is precisely the meaning that one finds°signi-fied\\nsignified by one\\'s sensations: the sensations, as such, may be\\nprecisely alike in the four cases. Perceiving, to restate a\\npsychological commonplace, is interpreting. The content of\\nthe perception is what is signified.\\nNow, it is to be noted that the meaning constitutes for\\nus the whole value of the experience. As a physiological fact,\\nthe occurrence of nerve tremors of some sort may be the\\nimportant thing. But as a fact of human experience, the\\nimportant thing is that the experience has significance. It\\nmeans something to us. It reports something to our°intelli-gence\\nintelligence. Absolute nonsense and nonentity are synonymous as\\nmatters of conscious experience. It is true enough that°with-out\\nwithout the idea as existence there would be no experience; the\\nsensuous clustering is a condition sine qua non of all, even\\nthe highest spiritual, consciousness. But it is none the less\\ntrue that if we could strip any psychical existence of all its\\nqualities except bare existence, there would be nothing left,\\nnot even existence, for our intelligence. Even the fact that\\nthere is an experience, aside from what it is, is not the\\nsensation itself; it is the interpretation of the sensation. It is\\n\\n ― 179 ―\\n                            \\npart of the meaning. If we take out of an experience all that\\nit means, as distinguished from what it is—a particular\\noccurrence at a certain time, there is no psychical°experi-ence\\nexperience. The barest fragment of consciousness that can be hit\\nupon has meaning as well as being. Take away the meaning,\\nand consciousness vanishes.\\nWe may seem to be dwelling needlessly upon the°veri-est\\nveriest truism of psychology-that its subject-matter is°con-scious\\nconscious experience, for that is all that is really meant when we\\nsay that significance constitutes the worth of an idea. But,\\nperhaps because it is such a truism, there is no fact so often\\noverlooked. The fundamental distinction between physical\\nfacts and psychical facts is not that the former exist in space,\\nthe latter in time, or any other specific distinction of mode of\\noccurrence. It is that physical facts as such are facts of\\nexistence; psychical facts are facts of meaning. Physical\\nfacts have meaning, but they have it as psychical, in relation\\nto intelligence; psychical facts have existence, but the°exist-ence\\nexistence does not constitute their express value in human°experi-ence\\nexperience. An idiot has as many ideas, qua existences, as°Shake-speare\\nShakespeare; the delirious patient has, in all probability, more in a\\ngiven time than his physician.\\nWhat then is the nature of meaning, of significance, of\\nthat which is conveyed by every fact of consciousness, and\\nwhich constitutes the value of that fact? It is, of course, a\\nmediate factor; it is due to inference. In passing, I must\\ncommend this statement to those who are telling us that the\\nonly realities which we can ultimately admit are those which\\nare immediately present in some state of consciousness, and\\nthat we must reject all inference if we are to get the fact. For\\nmy part, it seems that when the mediate element is gone,\\nmeaning is gone, and consciousness itself disappears. If\\nsomeone takes away from me all the inference contained in a\\nfact, hunt as hard as I will, I cannot find but that he has\\ntaken with him the fact also. He may have left me with\\nnervous tremors in my brain, but all significance, i.e.,°con-scious\\nconscious experience, is gone. So far is it from being true that\\nwe know only what is immediately present in consciousness,\\nthat it should rather be said that what is immediately°pres-ent\\npresent is never known.\\n\\n ― 180 ―\\n                            \\nBut we must leave these general statements and come\\nto particulars. That which is immediately present is the\\nsensuous existence; that which is known is the content°con-veyed\\nconveyed by this existence. The sensuous material is of worth\\nonly as it is a sign; it is a sign only as it signifies or points\\nout meaning. This meaning is present as mediated. It is not\\nthere as existence; it is there as pointed towards, as°symbol-ized\\nsymbolized. If we owe nothing else to what is called physiological\\npsychology, the experimental result reached by Helmholtz,\\nthat we always neglect sensations, or pay no attention to\\nthem as existence, in behalf of the meaning conveyed by\\nthem, gives physiological psychology a higher scientific\\nstand than introspective psychology has yet attained; for\\nintrospective psychology is always descriptive, while°Helm-holtz\\nHelmholtz\\'s generalization explains. It is true, for example, that\\nevery experience of tone is complex, containing the°funda-mental\\nfundamental and the partials. Yet we are entirely unconscious of\\nthis complexity, which as matter of sensuous existence is the\\nall-important thing. Why? Because this complexity is taken\\nsolely as a sign of the instrument to which the tone is\\nreferred-human voice, violin, piano. We interpret the°var-ious\\nvarious combinations of sensations as signifying this or that\\nobject. We are equally unconscious of the nature of the\\nsensations in themselves, and of the process we go through.\\nPsychical result or significance is all intelligence cares for.\\nStarting-point and way to this result are swallowed up in\\nwhat they symbolize. This explains \"unconscious°cerebra-tion\\ncerebration\" on its psychical side. Processes, whether of perception\\nor of reasoning, are of no account to intelligence except as\\nthey lead to meaning. Perception is well defined as°uncon-scious\\nunconscious reasoning. And as such it illustrates the way in which\\nthe process loses itself in the result. The process is nothing\\nas a process, or psychical existence; it is everything in what\\nit means or symbolizes. In reasoning proper, the processes\\nare of some account to us, because we know that upon\\nvariations in the process depend variations in result. The\\nmatter is more complex, and we go through it step by step;\\nbut even here we do not pay attention to the process as an\\nexistence. We simply take one meaning at a time, and then\\ngo on to the next meaning. Reasoning is the way in which\\n\\n ― 181 ―\\n                            \\nwe separate and unite meanings into one complex meaning.\\nAs our power to reason becomes developed, and the subject-\\nmatter becomes familiar, we cease considering the various\\nsubordinate meanings in their relation to each other. We\\ngrasp the meaning as a whole, as we do in perception, and\\nreasoning becomes, as we say, automatic or intuitive.°Con-versely\\nConversely, when we are in doubt in perception as to whether\\nthe result is genuine or is an illusion, we do pay attention to\\nthe process. We repeat the process, analyzing it into its\\nsteps, to see if we have drawn a correct inference. So, when\\nwe wish to decide whether that red color is really on the wall\\nor is due to a purely organic affection, we move the body or\\nhead, and observe results, and draw our inference°accord-ingly\\naccordingly. We often separate the various steps in perception,\\njust as we often consolidate them in reasoning; but the\\nseparation and the consolidation are always of meaning, and\\nnever of the psychical process as an existence.\\nBut let us consider another example or two of the fact\\nthat we neglect sensuous basis and regard meaning alone.\\nEveryone knows that we have two retinal images of an\\nobject in every case of binocular vision; that is to say, we\\nhave two complete sensuous outfits. In the vast majority of\\ncases, these two sensuous bases are slightly different; in one\\ncase in a thousand they may be alike. Yet we are ordinarily\\nconscious of but one object; in some cases, those where the\\nretinal images are similar, we can be conscious of but one,\\ndo what we will. I know of no more striking illustration of\\nthe fact that sensations, as existences, are nothing for us,\\nwhile sensations in their symbolic function are for us°every-thing\\neverything. The sensations mean but one object, and, do what we\\nwill, we see but one object. The duality of the sensation is\\nnothing for us. But we neglect the greater part of the case,\\nwhen we speak of the matter as if it were confined to a few\\nspecial cases of eye and ear, and as if in these cases the\\nsensations, as existences, were only double, or triple or\\nquadruple. In fact, as existences, they are indefinitely°multi-ple\\nmultiple in every case. As I touch the table, how many distinct\\nsensations do I have? As the ray of light affects my retina,\\nconsider what a chaos of sensations is stimulated. I may\\nremark incidentally that a large number of the psychologists\\n\\n ― 182 ―\\n                            \\nwho have occupied themselves with the problem of space-\\nperception do not seem to have realized the elements of the\\nproblem. They first talk as if the problem were: How to get\\nspace-relations out of sensations, as existences? and°sec-ondly\\nsecondly, as if the problem were: Given isolated sensations as\\nequivalent to isolated points in space, to tell how these come\\nto be connected with each other in complex space-forms?\\nBut the problem in the first place is: How do we interpret\\nsensations into spatial meanings? and secondly: How do we\\ninterpret some sensations as isolated points and others as\\nconnected bodies? We do not start with separate points\\nwhich are to be combined through the medium of motion, or\\nin any other way. The separate point is as much an°infer-ence\\ninference, an interpretation of the sensation, as the connected\\nline, surface, or solid. Our experience of one is built up\\nalong with that of the other. Sensations, as existences, in\\nspatial perceptions as in all perceptions, are naught;°sensa-tions\\nsensations, in their symbolic quality, as inference is put into them\\nand they become meaning, are all.\\nOur fundamental position is that sensation, as°exist-ence\\nexistence, and the process, as psychical occurrence, by which\\nsensations are connected, never enter into knowledge.\\nKnowledge is both the sensation and the process in their\\nsignificant or sign-bearing quality.\\nBut what is the sense in calling the sign-borne content\\ninferential, and in separating it from the sensational basis as\\nimmediate? The general ground is the fact that the sensuous\\nclustering is all that is present by way of immediate°exist-ence\\nexistence, and it is convenient to have a term to express that\\nwhich is present by way of being signified or symbolized.\\nThe sensuous basis stands for, conveys to intelligence, the\\ncontent of the experience, and the meaning is present only as\\nthus represented. The sensations, as immediate existences,\\nhave no more meaning than letters of the alphabet or than\\nvocal noises. The meaning is read into them or out of them,\\nas one may prefer to state it. But more specifically, this\\nelement may be called mediate or inferential because it is\\npresent as the result of a process of reasoning. There is no\\nneed at this time, I suppose, to do more than state the fact\\nthat every perception is a judgment based on an inference. It\\n\\n ― 183 ―\\n                            \\nis indifferent to the sensation whether it is interpreted as a\\ncloud or as a mountain; a danger-signal, or a signal of open\\npassage. The auditory sensation remains unchanged\\nwhether it is interpreted as an evil spirit urging one to\\nmurder, or as intra-organic, due to disordered°blood-pres-sure\\nblood-pressure. The result is arrived at by a process of inference. It is\\nnot the sensation in and of itself that means this or that\\nobject; it is the sensation as associated, composed, identified,\\nor discriminated with other experiences; the sensation, in\\nshort, as mediated.  The whole worth of the sensation for\\nintelligence is the meaning it has by virtue of its relation to\\nthe rest of experience. Since the rest of experience is not and\\ncannot be present as so much immediate existence, we may\\nwell call the element which gives any psychical fact its value\\nmediate.\\nWe have just been introduced to some terms which,\\nindeed, it has long been difficult to keep in the background;\\nterms like \"identification,\" \"discrimination,\" \"relation.\"\\nFor this mediate element is precisely what we mean by\\nrelation, and the processes by which it is got at, and read\\ninto the sensation, are those of association and comparison.\\nIt has long seemed to me a remarkable fact that the later\\nwriters of the specifically British school of psychology, led\\nby Mr. Spencer, recognize this truth and yet do not think it\\nnecessary to revise their fundamental notions of intelligence.\\nI can account for it only on the supposition that they do not\\nattend to the double sense of the term \"idea.\" Their general\\ntheory of intelligence, as at bottom sensational, requires that\\nit be the sensations as existences which are compared and\\nrelated. Their theory, as it actually works, is that the°sensa-tions\\nsensations in their intellectual quality, as significances, are°com-pared\\ncompared and identified. Their theory as they employ it for\\npurposes of explanation is in direct contradiction to their\\ntheory in its fundamental presuppositions. If all intelligence\\nis a product of psychical existences, called sensations, plus\\ntheir association and comparison, no amount of association\\nand comparison will ever give a result which has meaning\\nfor consciousness. Strictly speaking, it is impossible for such\\nprocesses to occur. But if the comparison of sensations does\\nresult in significant experience, there must be a certain\\n\\n ― 184 ―\\n                            \\nintellectual quality in the sensations not due to their°prop-erties\\nproperties as bare existences. A relation of identity is not a\\nsensuous skeleton which runs through psychical occurrences\\nand ribs them together. It is identity of meaning;°perma-nence\\npermanence, in short, of intelligence.\\nAnd discrimination is not the introduction of°unlike-ness\\nunlikeness between ideas as occurrences in the psychical life. They\\nare already as unlike as they can be, each being already a\\nunique distinct existence: as Hume says, every distinct idea\\nis a separate existence. Nor can it mean recognition of this\\nunlikeness of existence, except in the sense that it is°recog-nized\\nrecognized that the two psychical occurrences do not mean the\\nsame. They may be unlike, but we should never know they\\nwere did we not discover that they did not point to or\\nsymbolize the same intellectual content. They must mean\\ndifference of times at least, and conscious experience of\\ndifference of times is just as much a matter of interpretation\\nof sensations as recognition of spatial differences is.\\nWundt has shown clearly enough, as it seems to me,\\nthat association is finally a function of attention; but, not to\\nconfuse ourselves with terms, let us take a simple example.\\nOf all the sensations which, as existences, are presented to\\nus at any one time, how many come into consciousness\\ntogether? To put it in the old-fashioned way, how many\\nideas can we be conscious of at once? To answer the°ques-tion\\nquestion in this form: Of idea in the sense of meaning, we can be\\nconscious of but one; of idea in the sense of existence, or\\npsychical occurrence due to separate stimulation, we may be\\nconscious of an indefinite, limitless number. Just as many as\\ncan be made to convey one meaning, just so many may be\\ncomprehended in one idea. If we make, for the sake of\\nexample, the assumption that the universe is a unity, it is\\ntheoretically possible to grasp every detail of the universe in\\none idea. In fact, it must be so grasped, for the unity of the\\nworld can only mean that it ultimately possesses oneness of\\nmeaning.\\nIn any given complex of presentations, therefore, just\\nas much will be selected and united into a conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience as harmonizes in meaning. The astronomer cannot\\nattend to the ticking of the clock and to the passage of a star\\n\\n ― 185 ―\\n                            \\nat the same time, because they are interpreted in two°differ-ent\\ndifferent ways. Were they interpreted in the same content of\\nsignificance, they would be, ipso facto, members of the same\\nexperience. To borrow Wundt\\'s illustration, if the eye sees a\\nfalling rod at one place, and there is a noise made at a slight\\ndistance, and if the noise occurs regularly after the rod falls,\\nalthough there is no connection between them, the sight of\\nthe rod and the sound will be united in the same idea. So\\nineradicable is the mind\\'s bent after meaning, that it will\\nforce it, if it be possible. In case, however, the noise is not\\nharmoniously related to the fall of the rod, the mind will\\nhave to alternate between the two facts. They cannot both be\\npresent in the same consciousness. Their unlike significance\\nmakes them, by necessity, two distinct consciousnesses.\\nUnity and difference, relation in short, is always a\\nmatter of significance, of content for intelligence, and not of\\npsychical existence. When we say then, as Mr. Spencer and\\nall the later English writers do say, that a sensation is\\nnothing until it is identified and discriminated-that is,\\nbrought into relations of unity and difference-it is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to remember that the identification and the°discrimina-tion\\ndiscrimination are elements of meaning, of relation to intelligence. The\\nsensations, or existences, never unite themselves, and never\\ndifferentiate themselves. But sensations, as they exist in\\nconscious experience, are always united and differentiated.\\nWhat is this but to say that intelligence is necessarily°in-volved\\ninvolved in every sensation as known, and, therefore, that it is\\nimpossible to derive intelligence from any combination of\\nsensations? Let us remember two things: first, a sensation is\\nnot knowledge until united and differentiated; secondly,\\nthese processes have absolutely no reference to the existence\\nof the sensations, but only to their significance, to the°mean-ing\\nmeaning conveyed by them. Can we avoid drawing the°conclu-sions\\nconclusions: negatively, that relations—that is, connections of\\nunity and difference of meaning—can never be produced by\\nsensations as psychical existences; and, positively, that the\\nfactor of relation—or ideal significance-is necessarily°re-quired\\nrequired to make sensations elements of conscious experience?\\nThis brings us to the fact that relations are thoroughly\\nideal. Lewes frequently noted that science is a process of\\n\\n ― 186 ―\\n                            \\nidealization, but he seems never to have realized either the\\ntrue import of idealization, or the fact that all knowledge,\\nperception included, requires the ideal element. Idealization\\nis not a process of departure from the material presented in\\nperception, for this material is itself ideal. The idealization\\nof science is simply a further development of this ideal\\nelement. It is, in short, only rendering explicit and definite\\nthe meaning, the idea, already contained in perception. In\\nthe act of perception we do not realize anything like the\\nwhole meaning of what the sensations convey; our°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation is fragmentary and inadequate. The other processes of\\nknowledge, the so-called faculties of memory, conception,\\njudgment, self-consciousness, etc., are only progressively\\nfuller interpretations, as each introduces some ideal factor—\\nthat is, relation—neglected by the previous. Memory, for\\nexample, simply makes explicit that ideal relation of our\\npresent experience to past experiences, which is involved in\\nevery perception, and which indeed makes it what it is,\\nalthough in the stage of perception we are not conscious of\\nthis relation. Self-consciousness, again, is simply the°con-scious\\nconscious recognition that the ideal element is involved in all\\nknowledge together with what is implied in this statement.\\nSelf-consciousness is the idealizing process of all knowledge\\ncontinued till it becomes conscious of itself. But these are\\naspects of the question that must now be deferred.\\nWe have to ask what is the especial ground for calling\\nthe element which makes knowledge significant an ideal\\nelement? The answer in general is that this factor is ideal,\\nbecause it is not present by way of immediate psychical\\noccurrence, but as meaning. It is significance; and this is\\nsignificance, presence as symbolized. It is convenient to have\\na term to denote what is present in the way of meaning\\nrather than in the way of existence, and the term \"ideal\"\\njust meets the demand. It meets it negatively in suggesting\\nthat this factor is not one of space- and time-existence and\\noccurrence; it meets it positively in suggesting that it is due\\nto intelligence.\\nThis is the point which has now to be shown, and\\nshown not through an examination of the logical conditions\\nof experience, but through a psychological inquiry into its\\n\\n ― 187 ―\\n                            \\nfacts. Whence come the ideal elements which give to°experi-ence\\nexperience its meaning? By what process do we interpret°sensa-tions\\nsensations so that they become significant to us of objects and\\nevents in space and time? These questions are simply the\\nfundamental questions of psychology, and can be answered\\nonly by a complete treatise on psychology. Nothing but very\\ngeneral considerations may be expected of me here. The\\nanswer which is ordinarily given to the question, the one we\\nhave just seen given, is undoubtedly the correct answer.\\nSensations get meaning by being interpreted through their\\nrelations to the rest of experience; through the processes of\\nidentification and discrimination. But the sensation is not\\nidentified with nor discriminated from another sensation.\\nThis would add no whit to its significance, besides being a\\nprocess psychologically impossible. Previous sensations, as\\nexistences, are gone for ever; gone as much as the time in\\nwhich they occurred. It is true, doubtless, that they have left\\norganic traces of their occurrence in the brain; it may be\\ntrue that these organic traces may, by indirect stimulation,\\nre-awaken sensations like to the previous ones. But in this\\nprocess there is, as such, no aid. There is so much sensuous\\nmaterial indirectly stimulated added to the sensuous°mate-rial\\nmaterial directly stimulated, and that is all. If sensations before\\nwere multiple, chaotic, needing interpretation, there has\\nbeen added more multiple chaotic material, equally in need\\nof interpretation. Multiplication of sensations is not°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation of sensations previously existent.\\nThe identification is of the meaning of the present\\nsensation with some meaning previously experienced, but\\nwhich, although previously experienced, still exists because\\nit is meaning, and not occurrence. This identification gives\\nthe present sensation all the meaning possessed by those\\nexperiences with which it is identified. It renders it symbolic\\nof whatever these other experiences signified. If I attribute\\nany meaning to the idea gold, all that meaning is transferred\\ninto the present sensation as soon as this sensation is seen to\\nhave the same symbolism. And it is seen to have the same\\nsymbolism just because the mind brings this meaning to\\nbear upon the given sensation. There is undoubtedly a°mech-anism\\nmechanism, conveniently termed the association of ideas, which\\n\\n ― 188 ―\\n                            \\ninsures that the mind brings a certain set, as it were, of its\\ninterpreting activities to bear rather than another, but the\\nfinal result of meaning is wholly dependent upon the group\\nof ideal significances which is brought to bear. The°inter-preting\\ninterpreting activity may bring itself to bear in such a way that it\\nshall regard the sensations as iron pyrites or as the talisman\\nof life; but upon this way depends the meaning of the\\nexperience. In short, the sole way of accounting for the fact\\nthat we have significant experience, or that sensations, in\\naddition to being psychical occurrences, are also psychical\\nmeanings, is that the mind conserves permanently out of\\nevery experience the meaning of that experience, and, when\\nit sees fit, reads this conserved meaning into a given°sensa-tion\\nsensation, thereby completing the transfer of significance. The\\nexperience, as an existence at a given time, has for ever\\nvanished. Its meaning, as an ideal quality, remains as long\\nas the mind does. Indeed, its remaining is the remaining of\\nthe mind; the conservation of the ideal quality of experience\\nis what makes the mind a permanence.\\nIf it be asked, then, how psychical experience can\\nbegin, the answer is, indifferently, either that it does not\\nbegin, or that it begins as the beginning of the development\\n—the manifestation—of internal content of intelligence. It\\ndoes not begin in the sense that meaning arises out of that\\nwhich has no meaning. It does not begin in the sense that\\nsensations as mere occurrences ever group themselves so\\nthat they have in addition meaning. For meaning is mediate,\\nbeing through relation; it is ideal, being what is symbolized\\nto intelligence. If intelligence were not present with a°mini-mum\\nminimum of intelligent or ideal quality to read into sensations,\\nthese sensations would never get significance, or presence in\\nconscious experience. The mind must possess at the very\\noutset the idea that there is meaning there. It must project\\ninto sensations the conception that they are significant, even\\nif it does not develop the measure of this significance. A\\nmind which does not come to sensations with an ineradicable\\npre-judgment that the sensations are interpretable, that is,\\npossible bearers of an ideal quality, does not have the°start-ing\\nstarting-point for any interpretation, and its sensation could not\\never get a beginning on the road of meaning. The sensations\\n\\n ― 189 ―\\n                            \\nmight conceivably revive each other and fuse with each\\nother indefinitely, but meaning is absent until they°symbol-ize\\nsymbolize each other; and they fail to symbolize each other until the\\nmeaning of one is represented by another. But, after all, the\\nconception of the recalling and fusing of sensations is not\\none to be allowed, except upon the supposition of the°inter-preting\\ninterpreting activity of intelligence. The very fact that sensations\\nare so connected that the peripheral stimulation of one kind\\nwill set up the central stimulation of another is due to the\\nunification of meaning which has some time made them\\nfractional members of one whole, so that one cannot recur,\\neven as existence, without the other. Attention has at some\\ntime laid its delaying hand upon them and conjoined them; it\\nhas selected them for and excluded others from its°connect-ing\\nconnecting grasp; and this is to say that they have been given a\\nunity in that which they symbolize. Sensations cannot revive\\neach other except as members of one whole of meaning; and\\neven if they could, we should have no beginning of°signifi-cant\\nsignificant experience. Significance, meaning, must be already\\nthere. Intelligence, in short, is the one indispensable°condi-tion\\ncondition of intelligent experience.\\nThis seen and stated, it becomes a question of simple\\nfact how far developed in any case the necessary intelligence\\nmay be. For our general considerations, it is enough that the\\nminimum requirement of an intelligence which recognizes\\nthat its sensations have meaning be met; whether any°defi-nite\\ndefinite meanings, and, if so, what, are projected into°sensa-tions\\nsensations, is at present a matter of indifference. We do not care\\nwhether they are interpreted as in space and time; as°pos-sessing\\npossessing necessarily quantity, quality, relation and modality\\nor not. It is enough to know that they become experience\\nonly as interpreting intelligence projects into them°some-thing\\nsomething of its own being; they are what they are through this\\nrelation to intelligence. There is therefore no beginning of\\nintelligent experience, except such as involves intelligence.\\nThis leads us to recognize that intelligence has a°neces-sary\\nnecessary internal permanent content; and that it is only because\\nit has, and because it supplies it to its sense-stimuli, that\\nthere ever arises significant experience, and that this occurs\\njust in the degree in which intelligence possesses a synthetic\\n\\n ― 190 ―\\n                            \\ncontent which it can project into its stimuli. In other words,\\nwhether we inquire after the origin or growth of mental\\nexperience we find involved a synthetic intelligence, that is\\nto say, an intelligence which possesses a content as opposed\\nto one which is purely formal. Recent Empirical Psychology\\nshows that it has run the circuit and returned to the position\\nof Locke. Locke fitted the mind out with sensations on the\\none side, and associating comparing activities on the other.\\nThese latter were purely formal. They merely operated from\\nwithout upon the material of sense, dividing and combining.\\nThen Psychology attempted to get along with the sensations\\nonly. But it was driven to re-introduce the associating°activ-ity\\nactivity, and now we see it driven to bring back the comparing\\nrelating activity. We have complaints that the Empirical\\nSchool has neglected the native ^relating capacity of the\\nmind, and that we must recognize that it is endowed with\\nthe ability to identify and discriminate. But this relating\\ncapacity is still conceived as formal, although the conception\\ninvolves a contradiction. The relations are conceived as°su-perinduced\\nsuperinduced, as it were, upon the material of sensation,°intro-ducing\\nintroducing ab extra order into them; instead of as necessary to\\nconstitute their entire being as members of conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. When Psychology recognizes that the relating activity\\nof mind is one not exercised upon sensations, but one which\\nsupplies relations and thereby makes meaning (makes°expe-rience\\nexperience, as Kant said), Psychology will be in a position to\\nexplain, and thus to become Philosophy.\\nThe mention of Kant\\'s name suggests that both his\\nstrength and his weakness lie in the line just mentioned. It is\\nhis strength that he recognizes that an apperceptive unity\\ninterpreting sensations through categories which constitute\\nthe synthetic content of self-consciousness is indispensable to\\nexperience. It is his weakness that he conceives this content\\nas purely logical and hence as formal. Self-consciousness has\\na material, a psychological content. Kant was never able to\\nbridge the dualism between his a priori form and his a\\nposteriori content, because he conceived of sensations as\\nfurnishing meaning provided only they were unified by the\\nforms of intuition and the categories of understanding. In\\ntruth, the sensations supply no meaning. It is the sensations,\\n\\n ― 191 ―\\n                            \\nhowever, with the ideal content given them by the self,\\nwhich are meaning. The self does not work with a priori\\nforms upon an a posteriori material, but intelligence as ideal\\n(or a priori) constitutes experience (or the a posteriori) as\\nhaving meaning.\\nBut I must return from this digression. Experience\\nbegins when intelligence projects something of itself into\\nsensations. We have now to recognize that experience\\ngrows, or gets more meaning, just in the degree in which\\nintelligence reads more ideal content into it. The adult has\\nmore experience than the child-the Englishman than the\\nBushman—because he has more ideas in his intellect to\\nbring to bear upon his sensations and thus make them°sig-nificant\\nsignificant. Were the theory of our recent writers of the°Empir-ical\\nEmpirical School correct, the difference must be (1) that the\\nEnglish adult has his formal capacity of relating more\\nsharpened, and (2) that he has a greater number of revived\\nsensations which he combines with his present. But it ought\\nto be evident by this time that (to take the latter point first)\\nthe addition of revived sensations would in itself make the\\nexperience more confused, make it less significant. It is the\\naddition of sensations selected because they possess the same\\nmeaning, it is their unification with the present as same\\ncontent to intelligence, it is their discrimination as°suggest-ing\\nsuggesting here and there a new and different shade of meaning,—it\\nis, in short, the supplying of meaning through sensations,\\nand not of sensations, that makes the experience more°signif-icant\\nsignificant. And this is to say that experience grows as°intelli-gence\\nintelligence adds out of its own ideal content ideal quality. So we\\nmay see (to take up the other point) that any amount of\\nsharpening of the mere power of identification and°discrimi-nation\\ndiscrimination, of comparison as a formal power, would add no whit\\nto the experience. The experience as an existence, as a\\nclustering of sensations, is already there. The sole thing is to\\nfind out what it means, and this can be done only as there is\\nsupplied the mediate relational ideal factor. The growth of\\nthe power of comparison implies not a formal growth, but a\\nsynthetic internal growth. It implies that when the mind is\\nstimulated to an act of comparison, it has a more varied,\\ncomplex, better organized system of ideas or meanings to\\n\\n ― 192 ―\\n                            \\nbring to bear upon its sensations, and thus to transfer to\\nthese its own content of significance.\\nThis transference evidently incorporates the given°ex-perience\\nexperience into the system of meanings or of intelligence, and\\nthereby the better prepares the latter for future apperceptive\\nacts; its incorporation adds to the synthetic content of°intel-ligence\\nintelligence, and thereby to the meaning of possible future°expe-riences\\nexperiences. The process of the growth of experience is°accord-ingly\\naccordingly a reciprocal one. Any experience has meaning as the\\nself projects this meaning into it from its own ideal store;\\nthis projection appropriates the given experience, as to its\\nmeaning, into the ideal store of the self, thereby farther\\ndeveloping it. Knowledge might be indifferently described,\\ntherefore, as a process of idealization of experience, or of\\nrealization of intelligence. It is each through the other.°Ulti-mately\\nUltimately the growth of experience must consist in the°develop-ment\\ndevelopment out of itself by intelligence of its own implicit ideal\\ncontent upon occasion of the solicitation of sensation. But\\nthis is again a thought to be elaborated at another time.\\nWe may sum up our results as follows: meaning°con-stitutes\\nconstitutes the worth of every psychical experience; meaning is\\nnot bare existence, but is an inferential mediate factor; it is\\nrelation and is ideal; as ideal it is supplied by intelligence out\\nof its own content; this content constitutes, indeed, the°real-ity\\nreality of intelligence. I think we may have reason now to\\ncongratulate ourselves that we did not, at the beginning,\\nmake any inquiry into the connection between this ideal\\nquality or the meaning of experience and objective reality.\\nFor, it seems to me, that would have been to begin at the\\nwrong end, and imply that there was somehow, somewhere\\npresent to consciousness, a conception of what reality is by\\nwhich we could measure the significance of our experience.\\nAnd I have become convinced by the inquiry set forth in the\\npreceding pages that if reality is itself an element in°con-scious\\nconscious experience, it must as such come under the scope of\\nthe significance, the meaning of experience, and hence°can-not\\ncannot be used as an external standard to measure this°mean-ing\\nmeaning. The reality of experience is, in short, an element of its\\ninterpretation, of its ideal quality or relation to intelligence.\\nWe do not have externally given to us some fixed conception\\n\\n ― 193 ―\\n                            \\nof reality which we can compare with our ideas, and thereby\\nsee how much agreement with reality the latter have.°Real-ity\\nReality, like everything else that has meaning, is a function of\\nour ideas. To find out what it is we must look within these\\nideas. It is the great merit of English psychology that in\\nattempt, at least, it has recognized this. It is its defect that it\\nhas tried to find this reality in the ideas, as existences, where\\nnaught can be found. We have now to see whether better\\nfortune may meet an attempt to discover the nature of°real-ity\\nreality, where all is ultimately contained and must be found in\\nthe ideas as significances, as meanings. I hope, accordingly,\\nat some future time, to ask after this relation of idea to\\nreality.\\n\\n ― 194 ―\\n                            \\nProfessor Ladd\\'s Elements of Physiological Psychology [First published in New Englander and Yale Review, XLVI (June\\n1887), 528-37. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nElements of Physiological Psychology. A Treatise of theActivities and Nature of the Mind, from a Physical and\\nExperimental Point of View. By George T. Ladd,°Pro-fessor\\nProfessor of Philosophy in Yale University. New York:\\nCharles Scribner\\'s Sons, 1887. 8vo., pp. 696.\\n\\nIt is safe to say that the publication of Professor Ladd\\'s\\nElements of Physiological Psychology marks an important\\nepoch in the study of psychology in this country, and even of\\nphilosophy. It would mark a fact of much significance were\\nit only that it presents such a striking contrast to what is\\npopularly understood in English-speaking countries as°phys-iological\\nphysiological psychology. Rash speculation, immature and\\ncrude generalization, unfounded assertion of individual\\nopinion as scientific fact, a maximum of fancy with a°modi-cum\\nmodicum of fact, this has been too often presented as°physiologi-cal\\nphysiological psychology. If we add that materialism of an unreasoned\\nand primitive type has frequently gone along with this°mix-ture\\nmixture, we shall not wonder that some psychologists have been\\nled to attack all psychology of a \"physiological\" character in\\nthe name of that which they call \"pure.\" But such works\\nhave had no countenance nor support from the real°investi-gators\\ninvestigators in this new science. Their work has been patient,\\nthorough, and detailed, for the most part on definite and\\nlimited topics. Scattered through various journals and°mono-graphs\\nmonographs, and making no pretensions to present wide°generali-zations\\ngeneralizations, its value has been overlooked even by special°culti-vators\\ncultivators of general psychology; how much more by the public\\n\\n ― 195 ―\\n                            \\nto whom popular writings appeal. In Germany, matters\\nhave been somewhat better, not only because there are many\\nmore special investigators, but because many of the higher\\nphysiologies, and Wundt\\'s masterly work in particular,\\nhave familiarized the philosophic audience with its broader\\nfeatures. Professor Ladd\\'s work ought to do this for the\\nEnglish-speaking public. Few men have either the occasion,\\nthe patience or the desire to wade through the immense\\namount of detailed specific articles, and reports which form\\nthe real physiological psychology. But no man interested in\\nsuch subjects at all has any excuse, henceforth, for°remain-ing\\nremaining ignorant of its wider aspects or even of many of its\\nspecial facts. Dr. Ladd has done this wading, this°compil-ing\\ncompiling, this condensing, this arranging for him, and has done it\\nwith a carefulness, a width of research, a thoroughness and\\na patience which leave little to be desired.\\nBut this, after all, is only the negative side of the\\nmatter. Its important and positive significance is that it\\nmarks the beginning of new methods of psychological study\\nin this country. It is natural, perhaps inevitable, that°enthu-siastic\\nenthusiastic devotees of the new discipline should greatly overrate\\nthe importance of these new methods, and even take°excep-tions\\nexceptions to such apparently axiomatic statements as that°phys-iological\\nphysiological knowledge in and of itself is of no psychological\\navail; but this one-sided and somewhat unintelligent°overrat-ing\\noverrating should not lead others to a neglect equally blind. Indeed,\\none of the traits of Dr. Ladd\\'s book is the skill and wisdom\\nwith which he holds the scales on this point. His generous\\nbut cautious position on the value and limits of the new\\nscience will command, I am sure, the adherence of the most\\nof his readers. But in lingering upon these general remarks\\nwe have kept ourselves too long from an account of the\\ncontents of Ladd\\'s work, which, though termed°\"Ele-ments\\n\"Elements,\" is of 700 pages.\\nAfter a brief introduction upon the science itself (to\\nwhich we shall return later), Dr. Ladd gives the first part of\\nhis work to a description of the structure and functions of\\nthe nervous system, without any reference to the phenomena\\nof consciousness as determined by introspection; the second\\npart describes the various correlations between these nerve\\n\\n ― 196 ―\\n                            \\nphenomena and those of consciousness, with an account of\\ntheir laws, while the third part presents \"such conclusions\\nas may be legitimately gathered or more speculatively°in-ferred\\ninferred concerning the nature (considered as a real being) of\\nthe human mind.\" The second part, which treats of°physio-logical\\nphysiological psychology, in its limited sense, is further divided by\\ntopics. It includes a pretty complete discussion of cerebral\\nlocalization; of psycho-physics, as an account of the quality,\\nquantity, combination and temporal order of physical°stim-uli\\nstimuli with their psychical responses; a very interesting chapter\\non \"certain statical relations of the body and mind,\" an\\naccount of the relation between mind and sex, age, race,\\ntemperament, etc.; and a chapter on the physical basis of the\\nhigher faculties—memory, attention, etc. The first or strictly\\nphysiological part occupies just about one-third of the book,\\nand gives a compact, accurate and for the most part clear\\naccount of the anatomy, histology, and physiology of the\\nnervous system. This portion of the book gives an account of\\nthe spinal cord, of the brain and its component parts, based\\nupon the researches of the best of modern investigators with\\nalmost a hundred illustrative plates (whose almost uniform\\ntechnical excellence is worthy of high praise); an account of\\nthe investigations of Du Bois Reymond, Hermann and\\nothers on the electrical properties of the nerves; a summary\\nof the views of Meynert, Flechsig and others upon the\\nnerves as conductors; an account of the sensory organs, and\\nof the embryological development of the nervous system. In\\nshort, we find that Dr. Ladd has possessed himself of pretty\\nmuch all that the best neurologists have had to say in their\\nchosen fields, and that he has summarized it excellently for\\nthe general reader.\\nIt is, however, to the second and third parts that the\\none interested especially in psychology will turn with the\\nmore eagerness, and also, I may add, with the more°satisfac-tion\\nsatisfaction. Dr. Ladd gives sixty pages to the vexed question of\\ncerebral localization. In this discussion, he states lucidly and\\naccurately the theories of Hitzig and Ferrier; of Munk and\\nExner, of Goltz and Wundt, as well as the researches of\\nmany less known investigators. We are also given quite a\\ndetailed account of the principal evidences bearing upon the\\n\\n ― 197 ―\\n                            \\nmatter, which are rightly classified under the three heads of\\nexperimental, of pathological and histological (and°anatomi-cal\\nanatomical). Finally, the general trend of the whole matter is\\nsummed up in a few judicial generalizations. We speak of\\nthis matter in particular not only because it is one of very\\nconsiderable importance, but also because it illustrates Dr.\\nLadd\\'s usual method of procedure in vexed questions—and\\nwhat questions in this subject are not vexed? We are always\\npresented fairly with the various theories upon the subject;\\nwith as full an outline as possible of the special scientific\\nevidence, and finally with a few careful and impartial°con-clusions\\nconclusions. Not every one, of course, will agree with these\\nsummaries; not every one will think that just the right\\nmeasure of credence has been given to this or that authority;\\nbut no one, I believe, will deny the spirit of thoroughness,\\ncaution and justice in which the work is done. In this°partic-ular\\nparticular point, Dr. Ladd\\'s conclusions seem to me to be in\\naccordance with the tendency of the best authorities at°pres-ent\\npresent—namely, in the recognition of the general principle of\\nlocalization, but with a denial of definite and separated\\n\"centres,\" and with less emphasis than formerly upon the\\nimportance of the cells as compared with the fibres. In his\\nown words \"everything in both anatomy and physiology\\nindicates that the principle of localized function applies, in\\nsome sort, to the cerebral hemispheres. So-called \\'centres,\\'\\n\\'areas,\\' are however in no case to be regarded as portions of\\nits nervous substance that can be marked off by fixed lines\\nfor the confinement of definite functions within rigid limits.\"\\nDr. Ladd\\'s treatment of sensation is, so far as the\\nsubject of quality is concerned, as full as the limits of space\\nwould allow. Following Helmholtz in general both as to\\nhearing and sight, he has by no means neglected other\\nauthorities. The discussion of \"muscular\" sensation is\\nhardly as complete as the present importance of the subject\\nwould warrant. Our author is justified in rejecting the°the-ory\\ntheory as to its central origin, but he does not seem to me\\nadequately to have weighed the evidence for resolving it into\\nsensations of contact, of the mutual push and pull of the\\nskin, joints, tendons, etc. The weakest point in the°discus-sion\\ndiscussion of sensations is, however, the chapter upon quantity.\\n\\n ― 198 ―\\n                            \\nWe are given, indeed, much the fullest statement that exists\\nin English of the methods employed, and of the particular\\nfacts ascertained by Weber, Fechner and others. But these\\nfacts have been employed by the latter as the basis of a\\n\"science\" of psycho-physics, and the importance of this\\nmatter would justify an extended reference to matters which\\nare not alluded to. How far can the category of extensive\\nquantity be applied to psychical states at all? Do we really\\nmeasure the relation between stimulus and sensation, or\\nsimply our own judgments? Can \"the least distinguishable\\nsensation\" be regarded in any sense as a fixed quantity, so as\\nto serve as a unit? Can Fechner\\'s formula be interpreted so\\nas to give a very different result from that which he gets?\\nDiscussion in Germany at the present time is turning very\\nlargely upon such points as these. Accepting the facts,°at-tempts\\nattempts are now being made to get at their highest°signifi-cance\\nsignificance, and an account of these discussions with a judicial\\nsummary would have added to the interest of Dr. Ladd\\'s\\nchapter. However, in a field of such vastness and°complex-ity\\ncomplexity, it is not surprising to find some important matters only\\nlightly touched upon.\\nFrom these topics, we are brought to that of sense-\\npresentation, as distinct from mere sensations; in especial to\\nthat of the projection and localization of sensations in space.\\nThis seems to me to be, upon the whole, the very best of Dr.\\nLadd\\'s work. It is equally excellent in the thoroughness and\\nability with which the specific evidence is treated, and in the\\nability and wisdom of its conclusions. Inverting Dr. Ladd\\'s\\norder, we will state the latter first: \"The object of sense-\\nperception, the presentation of sense, is not an extra-mental\\nentity, made up outside the mind, and borne into or°im-pressed\\nimpressed upon it through the avenues of sense. It is a mental\\nconstruction. The field of vision is a subjective affair, and so\\nis the field of touch. The same psychical subject which\\nreacts upon the stimulation of the nervous organs of sense,\\nin the form of sensations, by its activity in synthesizing these\\nsensations, constructs the objects of sense. The fundamental\\nfact is the presence and activity of the subject known as\\nMind.\" Or, as he states the matter at another time, \"only\\nmental factors can be built into mental products,\" and this\\n\\n ― 199 ―\\n                            \\nmust be by means of a mental constructive synthesis. The\\nsensation is itself a mental state; the process by which the\\nsensation is projected and localized is itself a mental process,\\nnay, \"a mental achievement.\" These statements put the\\nexplanation of space-perception upon its only possible°signif-icant\\nsignificant basis, and it is to be counted a great gain that no \"wolf\\ncry\" of \"idealism\" has kept Dr. Ladd from them.\\nI should be giving a very wrong impression, however,\\nif I let it be supposed that the chief emphasis is put upon\\nthese conclusions. The emphasis rests upon the painstaking,\\nminute and thorough analysis of the process. Dr. Ladd\\nstates that the explanation of space-perception involves the\\nrecognition of the following particular truths: (1) There\\nmust be a combination of two or more qualitatively different\\nseries of sensations. Thus pure differences in pitch alone, or\\npressure or color do not give material for constructing°spe-cial\\nspecial objects. (2) There must be a certain adaptability in the\\nsensations to form graded series and to combine with other\\nseries—a condition which is found for the most part only in\\ntouch and vision. (3) Every sensation, besides its general\\nqualitative character, must have its own \"local stamp,\"°cor-responding\\ncorresponding in some way to the part of the organism affected.\\n(4) There are various stages in the elaboration of°sensa-tions\\nsensations into extended objects. Of these, localization and°eccen-tric\\neccentric projection are the more important. (5) There is°con-stantly\\nconstantly required not only the activity of mind in responding\\nto stimuli with sensations, but in combining them in a°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic and constructive way.\\nDr. Ladd\\'s discussion consists in the extended and\\ncomprehensive treatment of each of the above five points.\\nOur limits of space forbid touching upon more than one, the\\nthird. Dr. Ladd adopts completely the theory of Lotze as to\\nthe existence of local signs, though not so completely his\\ntheory as to their nature. Dr. Ladd would hold that it\\nconsists in a certain shading of the sensation, and that every\\n\"spatial\" sense has a local system of its own. He thus\\nopposes the extreme theory of the English school, which\\nmakes spatial perception to rest upon \"muscular\" sensation.\\nIn this he is at one with Ward in England, and James in this\\ncountry. Whether he would also admit \"extensity\" or not as\\n\\n ― 200 ―\\n                            \\na specific element in the sensation does not°appear—appar-ently\\nappear—apparently, however, he would refer \"extensity\" rather to the\\nsynthetic reaction of the mind than to the sensuous element\\nitself. It would certainly simplify matters, however, if the\\nlocal sign could itself be made out to be an \"extensive\"\\nfactor, and not merely qualitative in the general sense. From\\nthese general principles, Dr. Ladd goes on to apply them to\\nthe special subjects of touch and visual space-perception.\\nFor this we must refer to the book itself, as, indeed, we must\\nfor all the other topics treated, except to mention that the\\nlast four chapters discuss the results of the previous portions\\nof the book in the light of fundamental metaphysical°princi-ples\\nprinciples. These chapters will be to many readers the most°inter-esting\\ninteresting part of the book, for no one but a narrow specialist\\nwill deny that the chief value of the specific psycho-physical\\ninvestigations lies in the aid which they afford in building up\\na \"spiritual picture\" of ourselves and of our relation to the\\nuniverse. A discussion of these results lies far outside the\\ncapacity of this article, and it is enough to say that in a\\ngeneral way the conclusions reached tend to agree with\\nthose of Lotze.\\nI have already suggested that I should have a word or\\ntwo to say upon the view of physiological psychology taken\\nin this book. The criticism which I personally should have to\\nmake upon it is that it is not one view, but a wavering\\nbetween two. The older opinion regarding physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology is that it is the science of the relations of mind and\\nbody; of the correlations of the physical and the psychical.\\nThe cause is evident enough. Psychology began with a\\npurely \"introspective\" study of consciousness, and after it\\nhad attained some completeness on this line, it was found\\nthat nerve processes are at the basis of many, if not all, of\\nthese conscious states. So there grew up the idea of a third\\nscience, distinct in some sort from both physiology and\\npsychology, which should deal with the correlations of the\\ntwo. It was not to deal in any way with the psychical in itself\\n(that was fully ascertained by introspection) but with its\\nparallelism with the physical. But it was found that this\\nphysiological application did not leave the strictly°psycho-logical\\npsychological facts unaltered; it led to pretty complete°transforma-tions\\n ― 201 ―\\n                            \\ntransformations of them, especially in the theory of sensation where the\\nchange was a revolution. Thus there has gradually arisen,\\nespecially under the influence of Wundt, the conception of\\nphysiological psychology as a method, whose end is not the\\nparallelisms between the brain and consciousness, but the\\ninvestigation of consciousness itself by physical methods.\\nDr. Ladd can hardly be said to have adopted either of these\\nviews, or even to have discriminated them. On the one hand,\\nhe says: \"Two sets of phenomena must be examined in their\\nrelations to each other, and the laws of these relations\\npointed out,\" (page 6). Again, (page 7): \"The constant\\nforms of correlation constitute the laws for the discovery of\\nwhich physiological psychology undertakes its special°re-searches\\nresearches,\" and (page 13), \"that the structures and°func-tions\\nfunctions of the body, especially of the nervous mechanism, and\\nthe activities of the mind are extensively and intimately\\ncorrelated, is a fact beyond all doubt. It is the particular task\\nof physiological psychology to show in what manner and to\\nwhat extent such correlation exists.\" On the other hand, he\\nsays: \"It is to be regarded simply as psychology approached\\nand studied from a certain side or point of view,\" (page 1;\\nsimilarly defined, page 4). \"The peculiarity of physiological\\npsychology, considered as a branch of the general science of\\nmind consists largely in the method of its approach,\" (page\\n9). \"The enlargement of our knowledge of psychology is the\\nend to be reached; physiology is to give us the way by which\\nand the guidance under which the approach to this end must\\nbe made,\" (page 11).\\nIt is thus difficult to avoid the conclusion that Dr. Ladd\\nhas confused two opposed—almost contradictory, opinions.\\nOn the one hand, physiological psychology is nothing but\\npsychology approached by a certain method; on the other,\\npsychology is to be completed by one method, that of°intro-spection\\nintrospection, and then there is to be a science of the relations\\nthus discovered, to those discovered by the science of°phys-iology\\nphysiology. That the two views involve radically distinct ideas\\nconcerning the mind and its relations to the body need not be\\npointed out. They also lead up to radically distinct°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical conceptions. The inevitable outcome of the°\"corre-lation\\n\"correlation\" theory is a continuation, under modified form, of the\\n\\n ― 202 ―\\n                            \\nCartesian Dualism. The other would seem to lead up to a\\nMonism or a theory which should regard mind and body as\\nnot merely correlate, but as members of one \"real being.\"\\nThis, of course, would affect only the third part of Dr.\\nLadd\\'s work which has been omitted from this review. But\\nthe confusion has its effect upon the specific treatment of\\ntopics like that of cerebral localization. The spinal cord and\\nlower centres of the brain are treated in part first, as having\\nno immediate psychical bearing, while the parts above the\\nbasal ganglia are treated in part second as being in°immedi-ate\\nimmediate relation to conscious facts. In other words some nervous\\nphenomena are treated as psycho-physical, others as purely\\nphysiological, although it is also clearly stated that the°en-tire\\nentire nervous system forms a unity, and is as a whole a\\ndifferentiation of one of the layers of the body. Dr. Ladd is\\nalso led into evident embarrassment at just this point upon\\nthe relations of animal and human intelligence, and, indeed,\\nupon the various forms of animal intelligence. On page 249\\nit is stated that the spinal cord of a frog, with the lower\\ncentres of the brain give signs of psychical phenomena; on\\npage 251, he says that the nervous mechanism, working\\nwithout any accompaniment of mental phenomena, may°ac-count\\naccount for the most of what is done by the hen or pigeon\\ndeprived of its cerebral hemispheres. Either different°princi-ples\\nprinciples are applied to cold and warm blooded animals, or such\\nstatements contradict each other. This is not the place to\\nenter into the discussion of the matter, but in view of the\\nfact that the nervous system is a unit and that the°applica-tion\\napplication of physiology has given us new and changed ideas in\\npsychology, and not merely an account of the physical basis\\nof already ascertained psychical facts, would it not be well\\ndefinitely to adopt the view that physiological psychology is\\na branch of general psychology characterized solely by its\\nexperimental method of approach?\\nThe other criticism which I should be inclined to make\\nupon the general character of Dr. Ladd\\'s book is that it\\ngreatly under-estimates the importance of the doctrine of\\napperception. Wundt\\'s work is, indeed, remarkably varied\\nand touches almost every side of psychology, but it is to be\\nregretted that his chief theory, that of central innervation\\n\\n ― 203 ―\\n                            \\n(stated in physiological terms), or of apperception, in°psy-chological\\npsychological language, should be so largely overlooked in a\\nbook of the importance of the one under review. Dr. Ladd\\nlimits apperception to clear and distinct perception; while in\\nthe German use, introduced by Leibnitz, and continued in\\ndifferent aspects by Kant and Herbart, and made central by\\nWundt, it signifies the inner central reaction upon stimuli\\nwhich reach the brain; or in psychological terms, the°influ-ence\\ninfluence of the organized mind upon the separate sensations\\nwhich reach it. Distinctness of impression is, indeed, one\\nresult of this central activity, but only one, and in many\\nrespects a subordinate one. Dr. Ladd\\'s under-estimate of its\\nimportance is to be regretted not only because it fails to\\nbring before the reader one of the highest and most°compre-hensive\\ncomprehensive generalizations (to my mind, the most so) yet\\nreached in physiological psychology, but also because of its\\ninfluence on the treatment of specific topics. For example,\\nDr. Ladd gives a very interesting chapter on the time-\\nmeasurement of psychical phenomena, which shows deep°re-search\\nresearch, great accuracy and which is brought narrowly to\\ndate. It fails, however, to convey the full importance of the\\nsubject, because it states the facts as a series of isolated\\nmeasurements. Such, indeed, they are to many investigators,\\nbut in the light of Wundt\\'s theory, they are no longer mere\\nstatements that such and such a process occupies so much\\ntime; they are facts illustrating the nature and working of\\nthe central activity of mind. So too Dr. Ladd\\'s treatment of\\nthe physical relations of the will, and of attention, would\\nhave been, in my opinion, greatly enriched by a better°appre-ciation\\nappreciation of Wundt\\'s theory—and all this, whether one accept\\nor deny the theory.\\nTaking the book as a whole, however, one cannot but\\nadmire its patient research, its massive learning, its°thor-oughness\\nthoroughness, and its candor. Dr. Ladd appears to have made\\nhimself acquainted and at first hand, with almost every\\nauthority on the almost infinite number of topics which fall\\nunder his comprehensive scope, even to the most recent. His\\nuse of them is discriminating and able. That there should be\\noccasional inequalities, is inevitable, but it is safe to say that\\nthese will be discovered only by the specialist, and even\\n\\n ― 204 ―\\n                            \\nthen, for the most part, only by the specialist in his one\\nspecial field. The book, to use a term generally better left\\nunused in a review, is indeed a monument; it is not only the\\nonly physiological psychology in the English language, but\\nit is deserving of this distinction.\\n\\n ― 205 ―\\n                            \\nEthics and Physical Science [First published in Andover Review, VII (June 1887), 573-91.

But discussion with regard to it\\nis continually shifting its point of view and its immediate\\naim. The discussions which filled our periodicals only four\\nor five years ago already seem untimely and aside from the\\npoint. New interests have emerged, new problems have\\nthrust themselves upon us. A new face has been put upon\\nthe matter. The question is one of such infinite variety and\\nmagnitude that we see now one of its facets, now another,\\nand the centre of discussion is ever changing. Certain of its\\nwider features endure for a longer time. The battle of the\\nseventeenth century was waged concerning the relations of\\nspirit and matter; the rallying ground of the eighteenth\\ncentury was the relation of God and Nature; the battle-field\\nof to-day is the human soul. Spiritualism or Materialism,\\nDeism or Theism, an anthropology which sees in man a\\ndivine image and superscription, or one which finds him a\\nproduct of the shaping of earthly clay,—these various°antin-omies\\nantinomies are some of the protean forms which the one°endur-ing\\nenduring question of humanity takes upon itself.\\nThe present way of putting the question, that which\\nmakes it centre in human origin, nature, and development,\\nis the outcome of the growth of physical science in general\\nand of the theory of evolution in particular. Is man the last\\noutcome of a series of physical changes following°mechani-cal\\nmechanical laws, or is he the spiritual end which nature in all her\\nprocesses has been aiming towards? Is man one of the forms\\nwhich the kaleidoscope of animal life has assumed, is he one\\nof the transitory varieties in which the type has embodied\\n\\n ― 206 ―\\n                            \\nitself; or is his origin from God, that in his very life in\\nnature he may yet find a way to make life divine and°God-like\\nGodlike?\\nIt is necessarily involved in this manner of conceiving\\nthe problem that agnosticism is a transitory resting-place, a\\nmere breathing-time for the renewal of the contest.°Agnosti-cism\\nAgnosticism is by nature a compromise. It is a treaty of partition\\nwhich would divide the kingdom of reality into halves, and\\nproclaim one supernatural and unknowable, the other°natu-ral\\nnatural and the realm of knowledge. It is an attempt to induce\\nthe Human and the Divine to dwell side by side of each\\nother, each in possession of his own domain, barred off from\\nthe other. It will forward us somewhat upon our way, which\\ntakes us into a consideration of the relations between ethics\\nand the physical interpretation of reality, if we look a little\\nfurther into this matter. There is something more than a\\nmerely general reason for the insufficiency of the agnostic\\nsolution. It is true, indeed, that God cannot be limited to the\\nsupremacy of one part of the universe; it is true, indeed, that\\na \"fact encompassing, closing in upon, absorbing every\\nother fact conceivable,\" cannot be treated as something°dis-tinct\\ndistinct and isolate from all facts. This, undoubtedly, alone\\nwould have been enough to compel thought finally beyond\\nthe evasion of agnosticism, the division of reality into°natu-ral\\nnatural and supernatural; but there has been a specific cause at\\nwork which has brought about the same result even more\\nspeedily. Where in this partition does man belong? Does he\\ngo into the realm of the physical or that of the spiritual? Or\\nis he too divided, his soul being allotted to the supernatural,\\nwhile his body is apportioned to the natural? The°impossibil-ity\\nimpossibility of any such division was rendered evident by that rapid\\ndevelopment of physical science which resulted in the°asser-tion\\nassertion that man belongs wholly to its sphere. Physics,°chemis-try\\nchemistry, biology, geology, each separately, and all in their°combi-nation\\ncombination, reached a point where they thrust forth their arms to\\nclaim man as a mere fact within the world of nature, the\\nrealm of events in space and time. And with man included\\nwholly in the physical kingdom vanishes wholly the last\\nremnant of excuse for even the shadow of the supernatural,\\nfor even that unknowable corner of the universe which°ag-nosticism\\n ― 207 ―\\n                            \\nagnosticism would still reserve for the sovereignty of the God\\nover all. In short, the history of the last few years has\\nrevealed that physical science, no more than theology, will\\nput up with a partition of territory. If a spiritual philosophy\\nwill not make and justify a claim to the divine and spiritual\\ncharacter of all reality, physical science will erect itself into\\na mechanical philosophy and formulate a counter claim.\\nFrom the religious side and the scientific, then, comes one\\ncry: What of man, of his origin, and his destiny?\\nA still further result of this development is the fact\\nthat scientific men no longer present themselves in a°destruc-tive\\ndestructive attitude, but claim a constructive mission. One whose\\nintellectual connection with the world ceased eight or ten\\nyears ago would be fairly astounded if he could regain\\nentrance into the realm of thought at this point alone. He\\ndeparted seeing scientific men attacking and denying, or\\nexplaining away the reality of religion and all forms of\\nreligion; he would return to find scientific men formulating a\\nreligion based on what they term scientific categories. He\\ndeparted seeing them engaged in fierce polemics upon free-\\nwill, responsibility, personality; he would return to find\\nthem framing ethical systems, having conveniently dropped\\ntheir negations. While his last glimpse of them would have\\nrevealed them pointing the finger of scorn and contempt at\\nmetaphysics, the first sight which would greet his°bewil-dered\\nbewildered eyes would be the vast structures of philosophy which\\nwere in process of erection. In short, he would find that,\\nwith the application of physical science to man and his\\naffairs, the whole attitude of this science had changed from a\\nnegative position to a constructive one. Lewes, who began\\nhis philosophic career by writing a history of philosophy\\nwith the express object of showing the impossibility of°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy, closed it by writing The Foundations of a Creed.\\nAnd this instance is accurately typical of the recent°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of thought.\\nWhat, then, are we to say to these constructive°at-tempts\\nattempts of physical science? Gladly welcoming its°abandon-ment\\nabandonment of destructive negation, and even of the position of\\nindifferent agnosticism, shall we equally welcome the°con-structive\\nconstructive picture of the universe which it is elaborating? In\\n\\n ― 208 ―\\n                            \\nthe vast field opened by such an inquiry, I shall simply select\\nthat corner which has to do with the ethical efforts of our\\nscientific men turned moralists, and shall glean only over a\\nportion of that.\\nIt is the especial contention of men of science who have\\nturned their thoughts to the sphere of moral action that they\\nare putting ethics, for the first time, on a scientific basis, and\\ngiving to it a positive sanction and a positive end. They can\\nnever cease contrasting it with what they term \"theological\\nethics.\" The latter, according to them, has no firm°founda-tion\\nfoundation. It rests upon the arbitrary decrees of the will of God,\\nand this will is an unverifiable assumption, or at best is\\npurely supernatural and hence out of relation to the true\\nends of humanity. The aim which theological ethics propose\\nis of equal flimsiness with the foundation, or, according to\\nsome of the more ardent, is even immoral, consisting in a\\ndevotion to one\\'s personal salvation in a future realm, and is,\\ntherefore, either utterly disparate with man\\'s daily activities\\nhere, or in conflict with them. And the sanction to which\\ntheological ethics appeals is, if we may trust these writers,\\nworthless, even if not morally degrading, being the escape\\nfrom some arbitrary penalty, or the winning of some equally\\narbitrary reward.\\nIn strong contrast to this picture is the glowing°specta-cle\\nspectacle of scientific ethics. Its basis is the ascertained and°dem-onstrated\\ndemonstrated laws of the universe. We are no longer in the\\nrealm of guess-work, of caprice, or of arbitrary decision; but\\nscience has discovered certain truths about all beings, about\\nanimal life more particularly, and about man and his°rela-tions\\nrelations to fellow-man most especially. These truths, capable of\\nthe same certitude and definiteness as the law of gravitation,\\nor of chemical combination, are the future basis of ethics.\\nAnd the end offered is equally sure and precise. Science has\\ndiscovered the law of evolution; this law shows the universe\\nmaking towards a certain end. What higher object, indeed,\\nwhat other object of human action can be conceived than\\nconformity with the law of all existence? Furthermore, there\\nis no longer a sanction needed; it becomes lost in the motive\\nto right action. Teach man the unity of his nature with that\\nof the world, make him realize that he is an outgrowth of its\\ndevelopment, show him, in particular, his oneness with the\\n\\n ― 209 ―\\n                            \\nsocial organism, foster in him the idea and the feeling that\\nhis good is the good of this larger whole and its detriment\\nhis loss,—and all this not as a matter of speculation but of\\nscientific fact,—and what more is demanded? Thus the°sci-entific\\nscientific men insist upon the certainty of their ethics as°con-trasted\\ncontrasted with the insecurity and arbitrariness of°\"theologi-cal\\n\"theological\" morals; they emphasize its reality, as put side by side\\nwith the artificial and factitious atmosphere of unsecularized\\nmorals; they extol its lofty ideals towering over the personal\\nand even selfish character of the ethics of°\"other-worldli-ness\\n\"other-worldliness.\"\\nIn spite of the vigor and ardor with which these ideas\\nare urged, some of us, at least, remain unmoved. We believe\\nthat the cause of theology and morals is one, and that\\nwhatever banishes God from the heart of things, with the\\nsame edict excludes the ideal, the ethical, from the life of\\nman. Whatever exiles theology makes ethics an expatriate.\\nAnd we believe these things not from obstinacy, nor from\\ntraditional prejudice, as it seems to us, nor yet alone from a\\nmere conviction that supernatural restraints and sanctions\\nare needed for the practical moralizing of humanity; but we\\nare convinced that the physical interpretation of the universe\\nis one which necessarily shuts out those ideas and principles\\nwhich are fundamental to ethics; we are sure that an°inter-pretation\\ninterpretation of reality which confines it to the coexistences of\\nspace, the sequences of time, and the reign of mechanical\\nlaw, is fatal at once to the categories of morals and to the\\nattitude of the practical life of morality. What can we say to\\njustify our tenacious belief?\\nIf we are to justify it at all, we shall have to make out\\ntwo things—one negative, the other positive. We shall have\\nto show that ethics, as an account of right conduct, and the\\nmoral life as the practical ordering of conduct in the right,\\nare not compatible with a physical interpretation of reality.\\nWe shall have to show that they are compatible only with a\\nspiritual interpretation, which in its broad and essential\\nfeatures is identical with the theological teaching of°Christi-anity\\nChristianity. Of these two aspects of the question we can at present\\nhope to touch only the negative, reserving the other for some\\nfuture occasion.\\nIn moral action we find at least three traits which are\\n\\n ― 210 ―\\n                            \\nboth incongruous with and contradictory to the principles\\nwhich a purely physical philosophy (that is, a philosophy\\nwhich applies only the categories of physical science) must,\\nat all hazards, insist upon. These are—(1) activity for an\\nend, that which has a purpose or aim, in technical phrase\\nteleological action; (2) activity from choice, from the°deci-sion\\ndecision of personality, volitional action; and (3) activity°to-wards\\ntowards an ideal, that which is not, but which ought to be. Of\\nthese three traits the first and the last run into each other\\nenough so that they may be conveniently treated together.\\nAction which is purposive, and action which is for the°reali-zation\\nrealization of an ideal, are closely allied phases of the same thing.\\nAs respects this one broad fact and the fact of choice,\\nhowever, the position of the physical philosophers is not at\\nall similar. They admit, nay, rather they claim, that ethical\\naction is that which has an end or ideal; their especial theme\\nfor self-felicitation is that they have discovered and°formu-lated\\nformulated it. But, on the other hand, the fact of choice in the\\nsense of implying any decisive power in personality, they\\ndeny. There are advantages, then, in meeting them on the\\nground that is common. Putting aside the possibility and\\nexistence of choice, we may inquire whether physical science\\nas such is adequate to determining the ideal of human°con-duct\\nconduct. If it fails here, upon its own chosen ground, we may be\\nassured that its failure is only the more manifest when we\\ncome to deal with the questions of personality and°obliga-tion\\nobligation.\\nWe will, accordingly, discuss the question of the°ethi-cal\\nethical ideal. The position of the physical philosophers may be\\nstated as follows: Modern science has reached a point where\\nit can include man under the same generalization with other\\nfacts of nature. The law of evolution shows him to be the\\nmost complete product of the same forces and principles that\\nare at work everywhere in the world. Now, this fact has two\\nethical bearings: it shows that man is not generically°differ-ent\\ndifferent from nature, and that consequently ethical science is not\\ndistinct in its methods and conceptions from physical°sci-ence\\nscience; and that, to determine the fundamental law of man\\'s\\nconduct, we have only to ascertain the fundamental law of\\nthe world. In short, ethics is freed from theological or°meta-physical\\n ― 211 ―\\n                            \\nmetaphysical connections. This is one bearing. The other is, that\\nwe have in the law of evolution itself this fundamental law\\nof both the world and man. Evolution shows us the goal\\nwhither the universe is tending, and also shows the means,\\nthe processes, by which it is reaching this goal. Evolution\\nhas now proceeded far enough so that we can see the general\\nlines on which it is working, and behold the general features\\nin which it is portraying its nature. In particular, the°evolu-tion\\nevolution of the social organism sets before us a definite law,\\nwhich enables us to extend vastly and deepen indefinitely the\\nethics of previous empirical schools without abandoning the\\nsure ground of experience. The law of evolution shows that\\nwe must give up the purely individualistic conception of\\nman, and must regard him as one differentiation of a type of\\nlife which, in working itself out, has developed the°individ-ual\\nindividual. By \"type\" is not implied any metaphysical conception,\\nbut simply that generic animal life is fundamental and prior\\nto any of the specific forms which it has assumed. This\\ngeneric animal life, this type, is the social organism.°Individ-ual\\nIndividual man has not an independent law for his own being; but,\\nsince he is a derivative product, an outgrowth of the social\\ntissue, the law of his being is that of society as a connected\\nwhole.\\nThis law of society, the well-being of the community,\\nis, therefore, the ideal for all human conduct. The individual\\nwho acts in conformity with it is moral; the individual whose\\nconduct makes against the furthering of the social organism\\nis immoral. It further results from this that the particular\\nvirtues, like courage, honesty, wisdom, benevolence, etc.,\\nare put upon a strictly scientific standing; their validity is as\\ncertain as that of electricity, or heat, or light. They tend to\\nbring about and develop the well-being of the social°organ-ism\\norganism; they lend a helping hand to the tendency of evolution.\\nThey are thus no longer arbitrary assertions of one supreme\\nwill, nor arbitrary and isolated declarations of a mysterious\\ninternal power called conscience. Indeed, we may go a step\\nfurther, and say that conscience itself gets for the first time a\\nscientific position. The individual, being an outgrowth of the\\nsocial tissue, must have embodied in himself signs of his\\nunity with it. He must bear in himself the witness of his\\n\\n ― 212 ―\\n                            \\norigin in the larger and more generic existence. This sign,\\nthis witness, is conscience. Man instinctively feels that°hon-esty\\nhonesty is right, and feels disapproval at injustice, because there\\nis incorporated within him the feeling that one helps, the\\nother hinders, that whole of which he is a differentiated\\nmember. Conscience is consolidated and social experience of\\nwhat makes for and against social well-being. It is the\\nsolidarity of consciousness.\\nThis picture of \"scientific ethics\" is, of course, an\\noutline sketch, and yet, if it fails anywhere, it is in that it\\nsets forth the advantages in the foreground and in high\\nlights, while the difficulties are relegated to the background\\nand smothered in the local shadows. It might pay us well to\\nexplore these obscure recesses, to insist upon a nearer view\\nof the diminished figures in the background; but, instead,\\nwe shall challenge the right of the whole picture to be\\nconsidered anything more than an illusion. It is painted with\\ncolors which are borrowed from the school of spiritualism,\\nand to which it has no claim; it is filled in with the shadows\\nof figures who live only in the realm of Will and Reason; it\\nreflects a light which has its source in God himself. Take\\naway this light, abolish this realm, dismiss this school, and\\nthe picture fades out into a mere meaningless blank. Such is\\nour contention. Or, dropping the figure and expressing the\\nmatter positively: if we grant the postulates of the ideal\\nconception of the world, if we assume the primacy of reason,\\nif we acknowledge the supremacy of will,—then we may see\\na certain truth in this scientific ethics, we may see how it\\naids here and there our account of the moral life, how it\\nsupplies, here and there, needed fulcra for the moralization\\nof man. But, denying these conceptions, as in consistency\\nwith a mechanical theory we must do, the whole scheme\\nempties itself of value. In a single sentence the problem\\nreduces itself to this: Can the ethical be regarded as one\\nwith the natural? It may be the natural transformed and\\nhighly developed; but if it is only natural and physical we\\ndeny the possibility of the emergence of the moral from it.\\nGranted the germ of morals working from the first, granted\\nthat this whole structure of the physical is only the garment\\nwith which the ethical has clothed itself, then we can see\\n\\n ― 213 ―\\n                            \\nhow the germ shall finally flower in the splendor of the\\nmoral life, how the garment shall finally manifest the living\\nform within; but not otherwise. In a word, we utterly deny\\nthat the physical world, as physical, has any end; that°na-ture\\nnature, as natural, can give birth to an ideal. How shall we\\nmake good this sweeping denial? By calling attention to\\nthree facts out of a multitude. First, this ideal is°incompati-ble\\nincompatible with the processes by which it is (theoretically) evolved.\\nIt is contradictory to that out of which it is supposed to be\\ndeveloped. The process is one of conflict; its very condition\\nis opposition, competition, selection, survival. The ideal is\\nharmony, unity of purpose and life, community of well-\\nbeing,—a good which does not admit of being competed for,\\nbut in which all must share. And, again, admitting the\\nphysical universe to have evolved a certain goal or end, this\\nis not ethical, for it is in no necessary relation to man; or,\\nspeaking more strictly, it is not man\\'s end: it is something\\nto which he is related as an instrument, a means. While the\\nethical ideal must be one of personality, the ideal which\\nphysical science presents is one which subordinates persons\\nto the relations of things. And, thirdly, we have been°admit-ting\\nadmitting altogether too much: not only is the ideal one which\\nconflicts with the processes by which it is evolved; not only\\nis it an objective ideal,—being in wholly external relation to\\nman,—but there is and can be no such thing as a physical\\nideal. Nature has no end, no aim, no purpose. There is\\nchange only, not advance towards a goal.\\nWe will take up these points one by one. First, as to\\nthe conflict between the ideal and the processes from which\\nit is thought to be developed. However much ethical schools\\ndiffer theoretically, they are all practically agreed upon one\\npoint: the universality of the moral end, in the sense that it\\nis applicable to all who come under it. The intuitionalist,\\nlike Lotze, who makes benevolence in itself the final end; the\\nutilitarian, whose formulæ are the \"greatest happiness of\\nthe greatest number,\" and that in its enumeration \"each\\nshall count as one and only one\"; the Aristotelian and post-\\nKantian, who assert as the end self-realization,°understand-ing\\nunderstanding by \"self\" not something particular, but a universal,\\nmanifested in every man; the evolutionist, who finds the goal\\n\\n ― 214 ―\\n                            \\nto be altruism,—all these, I say, are agreed that all persons\\nhave necessarily an equal claim upon the good. The thought\\nof each finds its practical expression in the dictate that we\\nare to strive for a community of the good, for a state of\\nsociety in which each has an equal share in the ethical,\\nhowever it may be in the other goods of life. The problem is\\nto reconcile this unity, this harmony, with the forces which,\\naccording to scientific men, are at work in bringing about\\nthat series of changes which we call evolution. These are\\nfamiliarly known as the \"struggle for existence\" and°\"sur-vival\\n\"survival of the fittest\"; or, rather, these are the results of the\\nforces. The process of evolution is going on because various\\nforms of life are competing for the quantum of food, etc.,\\nwhich is offered, and because in this competition those\\nwhich gain any advantage which will give them a greater\\nhold upon this supply, whether by organs better fitted for\\nsecuring it, or by those which give them advantages in\\nreproduction, are preserved while others are crowded out.\\nThose better fitted to the environment survive; those less\\nfitted go to the wall. Rivalry, struggle, is thus the very heart\\nof the physical process. In short, the ethical law is not only\\nunlike the natural law, but it is contradictory to it. It sets up\\nas its ideal certain conditions utterly opposed to the°condi-tions\\nconditions of physical change. There is presented to us the°diffi-culty\\ndifficulty, not only of getting the moral out of the non-moral, but\\nout of that which, if it be in the ethical sphere at all, is\\nimmoral. The ideal of the physical world is superiority in\\nstrength or skill; the ideal in the ethical world is community\\nof good, moral equality.\\nI should not mention this point—much less dwell upon\\nit—if it seemed to me merely a logical or dialectic difficulty\\nin the theory, which may be got over by a readjustment of\\nstatement. On the contrary, it appears to me to touch the\\nfundamental fallacy of physical ethics. It is not an objection\\nwhich can be met by showing that enlightened self-interest\\nwill necessarily develop benevolence, or that egoism will\\nmiss its end unless it has due regard to the feelings and\\npurposes of others, and thus become altruistic. If any one\\ndesire, it may be here conceded that benevolence came into\\nexistence when men saw that, because of the identity of their\\n\\n ― 215 ―\\n                            \\ninterests with those of others, it was well for them to pay\\nattention to the interests of others and to include the latter in\\nthe struggle for their own well-being. The difficulty is, that\\nthis assumes the whole point at issue, the very nerve of the\\ndiscussion, viz., the existence of an identity of interests and\\nthe more or less conscious recognition of it. This is the very\\nessence and meaning of the moral order: grant this, and any\\ndevelopment whatever of particular virtues and duties is\\nhypothetically conceivable. Omit this identity and the°recog-nition\\nrecognition of it in some poor way, though it be only in feeling,\\nand there is absolutely no ground for the evolution of any\\nvirtue.\\nIf anything is clearly recognized to be a fact, and is\\nrecognized as such by all schools, there is a radical twist in\\nman\\'s intellectual nature, comparable apparently to original\\nsin in his theological make-up, which causes him to ignore\\nthat fact, though it be central, or else use it in any way that\\nseems good to him, though the meaning of the fact be the\\npoint at issue. Such has been the fate of the fact of the\\nidentity of men\\'s interests, of that community in the good\\nwhich makes the welfare of one the welfare of all. This is\\nsuch an undoubted, patent fact to modern moralists, that\\nthey mostly take it for granted before beginning to theorize.\\nBut this identity, this community, is, nevertheless, the very\\nmoral problem which demands solution at their hands. To\\nsay that because of this solidarity, this union of interests,\\nmen become altruistic and benevolent, and so on, is simply\\nto say, that because of a moral order men live in a moral\\norder. The real question is, What is involved in this moral\\norder? what does it mean?—and this remains untouched.\\nThe true inquiry to be put in this matter is not,°there-fore\\ntherefore, how, granted an identity of interests, conduct changes\\nfrom self-regarding into other-regarding, nor even whether\\nsuch conduct ceases thereby to be selfish, but whether such\\nan identity of interests as is here postulated can be got out of\\nthe physical order, or whether it be not radically inconsistent\\nwith it. The answer which the physical evolutionist gives,\\nwhen he recognizes the problem at all, is an equivoke. There\\nmust be an identity of interests, he says, because all forms of\\nanimal life are differentiated varieties of one fundamental\\n\\n ― 216 ―\\n                            \\nform: there is an actual solidarity between them; they are\\nrelated, they make up one whole, by the very law of their\\nexistence. Such an answer seems conclusive because of the\\nbeautiful completeness with which it begs the question. It\\nmerely says that because there is a physical community of\\norigin there must be an ethical community of end. Does,\\nthen, the shark, which devours his prey, afford us an object\\nlesson in morals? a satisfactory demonstration of the unity of\\nall life in the common sharing in a good? But we are not\\nobliged to resort to examples to show, ad captandum, the\\nutter inadequacy of such a view. The logical ambiguity upon\\nwhich it rests is easily made evident. The fact that animals\\nhave a common animal origin does not prove that they have\\na common interest in life; the fact that all have before\\nthemselves the same end, namely, survival, does not prove\\nthat all have an equal share in this end. How have they been\\ndeveloped from their one source? By rivalry, by struggle, by\\ngaining a good at the expense of others, by differentiation of\\ninterests, by stronger weapons of attack, by superior°meth-ods\\nmethods of defense, by multiplying so that others are crowded\\nout. Physical oneness of origin is only the more convincing\\ntestimony to actual clash and conflict of aims. Where is\\nthere room for identity of interests, and this not by way of\\naccident or sporadic occurrence, but as the fundamental,\\nradical, all-important fact? And, again, how shall they all\\nattain the common end—survival? Ah! they shall not all\\nattain it, and those which do shall attain it at the expense of\\nthe others: so careless is nature of types and of individuals! I\\nhave insisted upon this fact of rivalry and competition, to an\\nundue extent perhaps; for, logically, it is a work of°superero-gation\\nsupererogation. It is not necessary to prove that the ethical ideal and\\nthe natural process are opposed. But it is necessary for the\\nphysical moralist to show that the natural process can°pro-duce\\nproduce a community of interest, a good which does not admit\\nof competition, one which belongs with equal right to all.\\nAnd how can he do this? What has he to offer, except the\\nrepetition of a physical unity of origin, which, however true\\nin its place, is utterly irrelevant to the ethical unity of aim or\\nideal? But, in fact, he rarely goes so far back as this. He\\ncontents himself with showing that, since there is among\\n\\n ― 217 ―\\n                            \\nmen a certain unity of interests, the recognition of this unity\\nis constantly growing and becoming a more efficient force.\\nIn other words, he begins by assuming that moral order\\nwhich he professes to explain. He comes to do this, we may\\nsuppose, by a process not unlike the following: Men have\\nbeen developed by a process of physical evolution; there is\\nactually among men a community of interests, a certain\\noneness of aim, therefore the former produced the latter. All\\nthat is further necessary is to show how the latter in its\\nextension has evolved the various recognized forms of°moral-ity\\nmorality. But this is an inversion of the true logic. Valid thinking\\nwould say that, since we have here a community of interest,\\na oneness of end, which cannot be the product of a physical\\nprocess, there must have been something at work besides\\nphysical evolution. Since we nowhere find man except in\\nsome relations of unity with other men,—be it in the family,\\nin the tribe, in the nation, or in humanity itself,—we°no-where\\nnowhere find man except as already living in the consciousness\\nof a moral order, an order which binds him to other men in a\\ncommunity of good. If, then, we find this rude and for the\\nmost part non-moral condition developing into higher and\\nhigher moral states, it is but the flowering and fruitage of\\nthe moral germ already there. It is but the wider recognition\\nof that oneness of man with man which is the essential\\nfeature of the moral life as distinguished from the natural.\\nIn short, the reasonings of the physical moralists gain\\nmost of their suggestiveness and all of their conclusiveness\\nbecause they unconsciously assume a moral environment as\\nwell as a physical, in relation to which the life of man goes\\non. Grant that a specifically moral order exists,—and a°the-ory\\ntheory of evolution may tell us much as to how this moral order\\nhas been realized in social and individual life in the past,—it\\nmay give us suggestions as to the use of means of further\\nrealization in the future; but it is forever helpless in calling\\ninto existence the moral order.\\nBut we must go on to the second point. Admit now that\\npurely natural processes may succeed in developing a°cer-tain\\ncertain end and in bringing into consciousness a knowledge of\\nthis end, and yet we have no ethical end. The mere fact that\\nthe physical universe as such is making towards a certain\\n\\n ― 218 ―\\n                            \\ngoal does not decide that man should aim at the same goal.\\nWhat is wanted is, not a goal for the universe, but a goal for\\nman. The ethical ideal is an ideal for personality. The°physi-cal\\nphysical evolutionist solves this difficulty by ignoring it. Having\\nconvinced himself that the processes of nature are tending\\ntowards a certain result, and that man is included in these\\nprocesses, it seems natural enough to conclude that this\\nresult is the end, the ideal, for man also. It is difficult to\\navoid forming the conclusion that here, too, he is a victim of\\na logical ambiguity, a confusion between end as something\\nactual and end as something ideal.\\nWe may be willing to admit at this stage that the°uni-verse\\nuniverse is tending towards a perfect unity in variety, a°com-plete\\ncomplete harmony, towards abundance and efficiency of life,\\nadjustment of an existence in its environment, or towards\\nany other of the many ends which have been suggested; but\\nthis is only to say that their last term is such and such, that,\\nwhen the physical processes have been going on long\\nenough, such and such a condition of affairs will actually\\ncome about. In short, what evolution presumably presents us\\nwith is an actual end; what we want in ethics is an ideal end,\\nsomething towards which man should direct his conduct.\\nNow, this objection may be interpreted to mean that\\nthe mere fact that the universe is going to come out so and so\\nin the long run does not constitute any reason why we\\nshould act accordingly,—that it offers no authority, no°ele-ment\\nelement of obligation, that it utters no \"ought.\" \"Will be\" is\\nonly a way of saying \"is\": it is only \"is\" projected in time.\\nEthics demands an ideal which says \"ought,\" irrespective of\\nthe \"is.\" But this objection, however cogent, would lead us\\nto the discussion of the subject of choice, for obligation is\\nthe objective correlate of choice. Obligation has no meaning\\nwithout choice. It expresses a relation which exists between\\nthe object-matter and the subject-choosing. And as we°de-cided\\ndecided to leave the subject of choice out of consideration at\\nthis time, the objection, interpreted in this way, does not fall\\nin the present discussion.\\nWhat, then, is meant by it? In substance this: an end\\nwhich is man\\'s end, whether ethical or not, must be one\\nwhich he has himself the power of realizing; it must stand in\\n\\n ― 219 ―\\n                            \\na direct and personal relation to him. All talk about an\\nethical ideal is utter nonsense unless man has, or rather is,\\nan end in himself. It is not enough that there be an end\\nwhich is worked out through man as an instrument; man\\nmust himself work out this end. Unless the term \"ethics\" is\\nto be extended so as to lose all specific meaning, it cannot\\nmean the behavior, the conduct, of the universe at large: it\\nmust mean the conduct of man. It implies that man has a\\ncertain end which he is to fulfill, to whose realization he is to\\ndevote his life.\\nCertainly, the evolutionist may say, but the very°advan-tage\\nadvantage of the theory of evolution is that in showing the end of\\nthe universe it also shows the end of man. Such reasoning\\nappears to me to be on a par with that example which\\nenlivens the treatment of fallacies in our text-books of°for-mal\\nformal logic: The end of anything is its perfection; death is the\\nend of life; therefore, death is the perfection of life. The\\nterm \"end\" when we speak of the universe means its last\\nterm, the direction towards which it is actually tending; the\\nterm \"end\" when we speak of the ethical end of man means\\nthe goal to which he is to direct his attention, that to which\\nhe is, so far as in him lies, to give reality. But there is a\\nfeeling, and one upon the whole well-grounded, that purely\\nlogical objections are not worth much; that they serve to trip\\nup an opponent in argument, to convict him of°inconsis-tency\\ninconsistency, rather than to establish any truth. So we must develop\\nthis line of thought somewhat.\\nAccording to the physical evolutionist, a given man is\\nonly one term in the revolving cycles of nature; he is the\\nmechanical product of past changes; he is one step towards\\nfuture change. He is a link in an endless chain. He is a\\nconsequent of antecedent states; he is precedent to coming\\nstates. The dashing waves have given birth to him, one\\neddy, in their endless motion. He comes into existence as the\\nmechanical result of past motions, he passes out of existence\\nas he dissolves into other motions. He appears as a°tempo-rary\\ntemporary unity, but in reality he is a mere part of a boundless\\naggregate. In other words, if we conceive of the universe as\\na whole, and then conceive it as having a certain end, on the\\ntheory of mechanical evolution, man can only be one means\\n\\n ― 220 ―\\n                            \\ntowards this end. He is an incident as regards the present\\nstate of things; he is an instrument as regards the future. He\\nmay be one form through which the course of evolution\\npasses; but that is all that he can be. What, then, in bald\\nAnglo-Saxon, is the sense of talking about the goal of the\\nprocess of evolution being a goal for man, except that it be\\nsomething in which he is absorbed, swallowed up, forever\\nlost? If man is a mere means in bringing about a certain\\ngoal, how can he have any end in that sense of the word\\nwhich is necessary to constitute ethical action? Can it be laid\\ndown as the ultimate law of human conduct: Thou shalt\\nmake thyself a means towards an end in which thou hast\\nneither part nor lot? The doctrine which is reputed to have\\nbeen current at some periods in theological circles, namely,\\nthat man ought to be willing to be damned for the glory of\\nGod, pales into insignificance by the side of such a command\\nlaid down as the sole and ultimate law of ethical action. And\\nyet, if man be interpreted solely by the theory of physical\\nevolution, the only possible significance of the statement that\\nthe end of the process of evolution is also the end for man is\\nthat man is a means towards this end.\\nBut this ambiguity between end as an actual last term\\noccurring at some future time, and as an ideal forever°pres-ent\\npresent in the way of a norm for action, is so deeply rooted in\\nthe consciousness of the times that we cannot yet dismiss the\\nmatter. I imagine that I can hear some one saying that these\\npast utterances are a needless confusing of a simple matter.\\nThe law of evolution shows whither the process of things is\\ntending; from this it is an obvious deduction that the°con-duct\\nconduct of man consists in furthering this end. The end cannot\\nbe brought about all at once, but there is progress towards\\nit, and it is the part of man to help on this progress. But, just\\nas we saw before that attempts to derive the moral order\\nfrom natural processes got all their force from an°uncon-scious\\nunconscious assumption of a moral order, a spiritual environment,\\nalready existing, so this answer derives its apparent value\\nfrom its assumption that there is an ethical ideal already\\nexisting. Granted that there is such a thing as an ethical\\nideal, and we may, at this point, concede that the law of\\nevolution can determine what ^it is, it can supply content to\\n\\n ― 221 ―\\n                            \\nthe otherwise empty form. But what we have been urging is\\nthat physical processes, mechanical laws of the universe,\\ncannot give birth to any ethical ideal. They may conceivably\\nimpel the world onwards towards a certain final outcome; but\\nwhere does the idea of an end for man\\'s conduct emerge? It\\ndoes not emerge; it is only taken for granted. We have here\\nanother evidence of the truth, that, if a fact be only common\\nand certain, it will be used to support a tottering theory,\\neven when the very existence of the fact is good witness to\\nthe worthlessness of the theory. The problem which lies\\nbefore the physical evolutionist is: How does there come to\\nbe an ethical ideal, and what is involved in its existence? But\\nthe physical evolutionist, with an instinctive feeling of his\\nhelplessness before such a question, passes it by, and°assum-ing\\nassuming that there is an ethical ideal, goes on to show how the\\ntheory of evolution determines what it is. Instead of°answer-ing\\nanswering the question which demands response, he takes it for\\ngranted that an answer has been given, and substitutes\\nanother for it. How does the idea of a natural end or goal,\\nthe final outcome of the universe, give birth to the°concep-tion\\nconception of an ethical end, an ideal of human conduct? To this\\nquestion he returns, in substance, the reply: There is, of\\ncourse, an ethical ideal; and the great merit of physical\\nethics is, that it reveals definitely and with demonstrable\\naccuracy the nature of the ideal.\\nNow, this paper is not written to deny that there is an\\nethical ideal; but this recognized existence of an end of\\nhuman conduct must not be taken as a matter of course\\nwhen the test of the efficiency of a theory is precisely an\\nability to account for this existence. The case stands here\\njust as it stood with the former objection. I was not there\\ndenying that as matter of fact there is a community of\\ninterests, a solidarity of humanity, which allows us to°postu-late\\npostulate a good in whose realization all men are to share. The\\npoint was that this identity, this harmony, is a spiritual\\nprinciple, an ideal which cannot be got out of the physical\\nprocesses by any amount of manipulation. And I am not now\\ndenying that, as matter of fact, there is an ethical ideal in\\nview of which all sane men live, move, and have their being\\nin varying degrees of completeness. The point is that this\\n\\n ― 222 ―\\n                            \\nethical ideal is a spiritual conception, one which demands for\\nits justification an ideal way of looking at the universe, and\\nthat natural processes have no such life in them as will\\nenable them to bring to birth such a principle.\\nWe pass on accordingly to our third objection. We\\nhave so far allowed to pass unchallenged the assumption\\nthat the physical processes have an end, a tendency, a goal, a\\nresult, for which they are making. We have only denied that\\nthis end gave any means for determining the end and ideal\\nfor man\\'s conduct. We have now to recognize that this\\nadmission has no justification. There is in nature, as natural,\\nno end; there is no final result; there is no outcome; there is\\nno tendency. None are more ready to admit this fact, or\\nrather to assert it, than these same scientific men when these\\nare not engaged in founding ethical systems. There is then\\nunanimity of agreement with Spinoza, that the idea of an\\nend in nature is a figment of the human imagination. Final\\ncauses have no right in physical explanations, no basis in\\nphysical processes, they tell us. And, indeed, speaking from\\ntheir standpoint, they tell us correctly. The idea of end\\ninvolves the conception, first, of the universe as a whole,\\nand, secondly, of a certain idea or purpose which the°uni-verse\\nuniverse is fulfilling. Now, the categories of physical science do\\nnot enable us to lay hold on either of these factors. Scientific\\nmen are constantly telling us that they are not concerned\\nwith the nature of Being in itself; they have not concerned\\nthemselves with the Absolute. Such empty abstractions,\\nsuch unattainable notions, they gladly leave to the°metaphy-sicians\\nmetaphysicians. For their part, they have their hands full finding out\\nabout the relative and the phenomenal. Now, this simply\\nmeans that they deal with the various connections which\\nexist among facts, finding out one here, ascertaining°an-other\\nanother there; it means that they deal with the world partially,\\nnot attempting to see it as a whole. The nature of things as\\nthey really are, the Absolute, on the other hand, ^is precisely\\nthings taken as a whole, viewed as one comprehensive unity,\\nself-related, because involving all relations within itself, and\\nself-explanatory.\\nBut we are not dependent upon the witness of authority\\nmerely. These scientific men are not giving us an account of\\n\\n ― 223 ―\\n                            \\ntheir own individual predilections; they are stating°some-thing\\nsomething that exists in the nature of the case. Science, as°physi-cal\\nphysical, deals with objects coexistent in space, and events°se-quent\\nsequent in time, and connected by the laws of mechanical\\ncausation. That is to say, it sees the universe not as a whole,\\nbut as conditioned by space and time, and shows the world\\nnot as self-explanatory, but as in every detail requiring\\nexplanation outside of itself. No natural fact gives any°rea-son\\nreason for itself; to ascertain its reason we must go outside of it,\\nand find its condition. In a threefold way, then, the world of\\nscience is not a whole; it is only a world of progressus ad\\ninfinita, whether of space, of time, or of causes. Hence the\\nabsurdity of attempting to find any final term, any outcome,\\nany result. Constant change, transformation of motion, is\\nthe law of nature. We cannot stop here nor there, and say,\\nBehold the end, the intention of it all. We are all familiar, ad\\nnauseam, with the arguments which show that in the°physi-cal\\nphysical realm there is and can be no first cause; the fact that\\nthere can be no end, no unifying tendency, is simply the\\nobverse of this.\\nAgain: end, if it mean anything, signifies the fulfilling\\nof purpose, the realizing of an idea. The end, the goal of the\\nuniverse, cannot be a last term; it cannot be something\\nwhich the past ages have been obliged to do without, and\\nwhich some happy moment in the future will see ushered\\ninto existence. Such an end would be an incident, an°acci-dent\\naccident rather, nay, a catastrophe. The end, in any intelligible\\nsense, must be a unity which binds together every event,\\nevery existence. It must have the same reference to an event\\nwhich occurred a million years ago, as to one which will\\noccur ten million years from now. In other words, it is that\\nwhich interprets, which gives meaning to, which unifies all\\nprocesses. And such a unity cannot be an object which exists\\nin some place, or an event which occurs at some time. It\\ncannot be one conditioned existence in a series of conditioned\\nexistences. It can be only an idea, a spiritual, an ideal unity\\nof purpose and meaning.\\nThe conception of end, therefore, has no place in the\\nlexicon of the physicist. It is consistent only with a°teleologi-cal\\nteleological interpretation of the world; one which sees it as the\\n\\n ― 224 ―\\n                            \\nembodiment of reason, and the manifestation of intelligent\\npurpose. We get now very close to the truth of the matter.\\nThe arguments of the physical evolutionists, when they offer\\nthemselves as constructive moralists, are to the effect that,\\nno matter if our arguments do show that there cannot be an\\nend or goal in the physical world, facts show there is one. It\\nis because of this, they further say, that they are not°incon-sistent\\ninconsistent in denying teleology, and in yet recognizing an end or\\ngoal as an ethical ideal. They deny teleology as a matter of\\nspeculation, as a matter of reasoning; but they recognize the\\ngoal simply as a fact, just as they would recognize any other\\nfact presented to their inspection. They are not concerned\\nwith the idea of purpose, or of final causation; but just as\\nthey see that a certain union of hydrogen and oxygen°pro-duces\\nproduces water, so they see a certain tendency going on—one\\nwhich has transformed the world from a homogeneous°neb-ula\\nnebula, barren of all distinction or intelligent worth, into the\\ncomplex universe of physical, biological, and social facts\\nwhich now confronts us. The law of evolution shows the\\nworld, together with the various subordinate departments\\nof reality included within it, changing from an incoherent,\\nindefinite homogeneity into a coherent, definite, or unified\\nheterogeneity. This latter condition, then, this differentiated\\nunity of related factors, is the end implied in all physical\\nchange. It is there as a fact; and beyond this our scientific\\nmen say that they decline to go. The fact is enough for\\nthem, without losing themselves in metaphysical subtleties.\\nAnd all this, it is not to be denied, strikes us as having\\na certain force. But where does it get this force? Simply\\nfrom an assumption of what is to be explained. The virtual\\nassertion of these men is that if you will only assert a fact\\nwith sufficient resoluteness, you may deny, with equal°reso-luteness\\nresoluteness, the need of any inquiry into its meaning. No one—\\nat least no one who is convinced that ethics has its basis in\\nthe rational and spiritual constitution of reality-denies that\\nthere is a tendency towards an end, an end which is°de-scribed\\ndescribed well enough in the terms of Mr. Spencer, but more\\nsimply as a perfect harmony, a unity in variety. But the\\nquestion is, What is implied in the existence of this fact?\\nAnd this question is not got rid of, much less answered, by\\n\\n ― 225 ―\\n                            \\nany amount of ponderous reiteration of the fact. We do not\\ndeny it: we inquire whether it is consistent with the theory\\nwhich makes such use of it, or whether it necessarily°in-volves\\ninvolves that reality is spiritual to its very core. Certainly, this\\nis not the first time in the history of thought when a theory\\nhas sought to eke out its insufficiency with the reiterated\\ndisplay of the very fact which is most incompatible with the\\ntheory. The ordinary mind hears the theory; it recognizes\\nthe fact, and carries over the strength of the fact to make up\\nfor the weakness of the theory. But it is never possible to\\nsuppress completely the inquiry concerning the relation°be-tween\\nbetween the two. And in this case we would say that the fact\\nthat the universe is seen to be tending towards a goal, and is\\npossessed of an end, is simply evidence that the purely\\nphysical theory of evolution, however good in its place,°ut-terly\\nutterly fails to work when applied to the universe as a whole.\\nWhen we come to this, we must substitute a teleological\\ntheory of evolution for the mechanical: we must read°physi-cal\\nphysical causes in terms of rational purpose.\\nSuch a procedure, therefore, as the physical moralist\\noffers us has at least two faults. It begs the question whether\\naction towards an end is derivable from physical categories;\\nand it falls into the plight of employing a fact to deny that\\nwhich alone gives it its existence and significance, namely,\\nthe incorporation of ethical ends in the very structure of\\nreality. We must, therefore, continue to deny that the°physi-cal\\nphysical universe as merely physical has any end or goal.\\nThe end of the somewhat long and tedious road which\\nwe have been following is that we cannot admit the claims of\\nphysical science to be the founder of the ethical system of\\nthe coming man. We have to deny it, because (1) ethics\\ndeals with an end, and there is no place for an end in nature\\nas confined to space and time; and because (2) even if there\\nwere an end in the universe, this would not of itself°consti-tute\\nconstitute the ideal for human conduct; and because (3) science is\\nutterly unable to establish the essential feature of the ethical\\nideal, its insistence upon the identity of humanity in their\\nrelation to it.\\nWhat is the bearing of this and similar protests? Is it\\nthe mingled objurgation and lamentation of those who see\\n\\n ― 226 ―\\n                            \\ntheir monopoly disappearing? Is it the clamor of those who\\nwant to cheapen the worth of goods offered by others, in\\norder that, when their own inevitable bankruptcy comes,\\nthey may dispose of their own stock and good-will with the\\nleast possible loss? So it would seem if we hearken to some.\\nBut it may be that the denial of the possibility of physical\\nscience to formulate a constructive ethics does not arise from\\na carping exclusive spirit, but from the profound conviction\\nthat in a world such as physical science takes cognizance of\\nthere is no ground for morals, no place where the moral life\\nmay so much as set its foot; and in the conviction that a\\nspiritual interpretation of reality can alone found a truly\\nscientific ethics and justify the living ways of man to man.\\n\\n ― 227 ―\\n                            \\nThe Ethics of Democracy [First published as No. 1, Second Series, University of Michigan\\nPhilosophical Papers. Ann Arbor: Andrews & Co., 1888. 28 pp. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nApparent contradictions always demand attention. When\\nthe contradiction is between a manner of life seemingly\\nbecoming universal, and a theory of this manner which\\nmakes it almost worthless, it is yet more striking. Such a\\ncontradiction we have in the present status of democracy. As\\nit gains practical extension in the affairs of society, it is\\ngetting lower theoretical appreciation. While it has never\\nhad such an actual hold on life as at present, no observer can\\ndeny, I believe, that its defenders have never been so°apolo-getic\\napologetic; its detractors so aggressive and pessimistic. To them,\\nthis state of affairs is no doubt additional evidence of the\\ntruth of their position; the more men see of democracy, the\\nless they like it. The contradiction is thus easily accounted\\nfor. But those who believe that the practical instincts of\\nmen, as witnessed in a long stretch of history and over a\\nbroad area of political existence, do not easily go wholly\\nwrong; and that in the case of a conflict of practical life with\\ntheoretical criticism, the latter is most apt to be at fault, will\\nbe likely to demand a revision of theory. Without further\\ninquiry into the causes of this break between the beliefs of\\neducated men, and the actual tendencies of political°organ-isms\\norganisms, I wish to make one of its recent manifestations the\\nexcuse for an examination into the basal conception, the\\nideal of democracy. This is Sir Henry Maine\\'s remarkable\\nbook on Popular Government.\\nThis book gives the ablest and most coherent°exposi-tion\\nexposition of one school of political philosophy known to me, for it\\nrests upon wide historical knowledge and is the product of\\nkeen analysis. Its examination accordingly will give not a\\n\\n ― 228 ―\\n                            \\ncriticism of Sir Henry Maine\\'s individual views, but the\\nmeans of coming to some conclusions regarding the°funda-mental\\nfundamental nature of democracy. The thoroughness of Maine\\'s\\nposition may be got at from the fact that he sees in°democ-racy\\ndemocracy no historical meaning, no realization of any idea. It is\\nbut the \"product of a whole series of accidents.\" Its future\\nprospects are as uncertain as its past is brief. It is \"the most\\nfragile and insecure\" of governments; since its introduction\\ngovernment is more instable than it has been since the time\\nof the Pretorian Guards. Judging from past experience it\\nalways \"ends in producing monstrous and morbid forms of\\nmonarchy and aristocracy.\" His account of its actual°tenden-cies\\ntendencies is such as his summary of its past career and°vaticina-tion\\nvaticination of its future might lead us to expect. \"Its legislation is a\\nwild burst of destructive wantonness; an arbitrary°over-throw\\noverthrow of all existing institutions, followed by a longer period\\nin which its principles put an end to all social and political\\nactivity, and result in a dead level of ultra-conservatism,\"\\nfor, as he oracularly remarks: \"There can be no delusion\\ngreater than that democracy is a progressive form of°govern-ment\\ngovernment.\" \"The establishment of the masses in power is of\\nblackest omen for all legislation founded on scientific°opin-ion\\nopinion.\" The summary of the whole matter is the dictum°ap-provingly\\napprovingly quoted from Strauss, \"History is a sound°aristo-crat\\naristocrat.\"\\nAs it is his theoretical, his philosophical basis that is in\\nquestion here, these views may pass without question,°al-though\\nalthough I confess that his ideas regarding the origin of\\ndemocracy seem to be based upon a view of history which\\ndenies to it all meaning except that arising from the°acciden-tal\\naccidental juxtaposition of circumstance; that his forebodings for its\\nfuture rest upon an irrelevant basis; and that the supposed\\ndestructiveness is due to the occasional necessity of doing\\naway with the evils engendered of aristocracy; and that the\\nlegislative infertility attributed to it goes rather to show that\\nin every state except the democratic, the masses of the\\npeople are more opposed to change and progress than the\\nfew. And so it may well be. But the charge lies against the\\nform of government which breeds such a mass, not against\\ndemocracy.\\n\\n ― 229 ―\\n                            \\nBut leaving these considerations, we must come to\\nMaine\\'s philosophy of democracy and government. Maine\\'s\\nfundamental position, the one which he considers°indispen-sable\\nindispensable to any understanding of the matter, is that \"democracy\\nis only a form of government.\" All views which attribute to\\nit any significance or functions not based upon the clear\\ninsight that it is only one among various forms of°govern-ment\\ngovernment are to be ruled out. This is our starting point. The next\\nstep is as to the meaning of government. Here the view of\\nHobbes, as worked out by the analytic school of Bentham\\nand Austin, is virtually adopted. Government is simply that\\nwhich has to do with the relation of subject to sovereign, of\\npolitical superior to inferior. This is the second point. The\\nthird concerns that which is taken as the distinguishing\\nmark of governments—that which differentiates democracy\\nfrom other forms. This is quantitative or numerical. If the\\nsovereign is one or few, the subject a multitude, we have\\nmonarchy or aristocracy. If the sovereign is the multitude,\\nthe subject a small number, we have democracy. For it is a\\ntrait of democracy that the apparent ruler is in reality the\\nservant; the seeming subject the true ruler.\\nWe have here in skeleton outline the main points of\\nthis school of political philosophy. But they must be°ex-panded\\nexpanded somewhat. Democracy is the rule of the Many, of\\nthe Mass. That is the essential point. Democracy is nothing\\nbut a numerical aggregate, a conglomeration of units.°De-mocracy\\nDemocracy is, accordingly, the most difficult form of°govern-ment\\ngovernment. For while it is conceivable that one man or a few men\\nshould have a common will, in no intelligible sense can a\\nmultitude be said to exercise will (Maine, p. 88). All°gov-ernment\\ngovernment is based on the exercise of volition, and yet a\\nmultitude cannot be said to have a common will (Maine, p.\\n202). It must be manufactured, however, in order to have\\neven a semblance of government, and Maine says the only\\npowers adequate to bring about this artificial unity are party\\nand corruption,—means of which, as he says, one is°inju-rious\\ninjurious to the intellect, the other to the morals of the°govern-ing\\ngoverning mass (Maine, p. 98). Democracy being this numerical\\naggregate, it follows, of course, that in it sovereignty or\\npolitical power is minced into morsels and each man\\'s°por-tion\\n ― 230 ―\\n                            \\nportion is almost infinitesimally small (Maine, p. 29). Citizens\\nin a democracy are \"fragments of political power\"; the\\ngrowth of democracy is the \"process of cutting up political\\npower into petty fragments.\" Here we have the adequate\\ntheoretical explanation of the instability and the°unprogres-sive\\nunprogressive character of democracy. Democracy, again, being a\\nnumerical aggregate, the multitude, although the ruler and\\nmaster, is obliged to delegate his power, since being a°multi-tude\\nmultitude he cannot himself exercise it, to the so-called ruler\\n(Maine, p. 81). In democracy, in short, the government is\\nan external power formed by a process of delegation.\\nIt will be seen accordingly, that the gist of the matter\\nlies in the question whether democracy is adequately°de-scribed\\ndescribed as the rule of the many, whether the numerical\\nattribute of democracy is primary and causal, or secondary\\nand derived. From the decision of this question will flow the\\nfurther answers to questions regarding, first, the nature of\\nsovereignty, secondly, the relation of government to the\\nstate, or the adequacy of the delegation theory, and, finally,\\nas to whether democracy is adequately described as only a\\nform of government.\\nIt is worth remarking that it is only superficially that\\nMaine has the authority of Aristotle for defining democracy\\nsimply as the rule of the many. Aristotle, indeed, uses the\\nnumerical mark as the basis of his classification, but in his\\nanalysis he realizes what Maine never does: that in reality it\\nis laws which govern the state, and that the men, whether\\nfew or many, are but the instruments of the law. Many\\nresults follow, of course, from this latter trait; it is not a\\nmatter of indifference whether few or many rule; but the\\nessential characteristic of each state is found, after all, in its\\nform of constitution and organic law. And certainly the\\nwhole drift of political theory since the abstract natural\\nright philosophy of the French Revolution has been towards\\nthe conception that society is an organism, and government\\nan expression of its organic nature. If this be so, it is no\\nmore adequately defined by any merely quantitative°concep-tion\\nconception than a tree is defined by counting the number of cells\\nwhich constitute it.\\nWhat makes it more surprising that Maine should\\nadopt the numerical aggregation, the multitude conception,\\n\\n ― 231 ―\\n                            \\nis the fact that in times past he has dealt such vigorous\\nblows against a theory which is the natural and inevitable\\noutcome of this conception. The \"Social Contract\" theory of\\nstates has never been more strongly attacked than by Maine,\\nand yet the sole source of this theory is just such a°concep-tion\\nconception of society, as a mass of units, as the one Maine here\\nadopts. The essence of the \"Social Contract\" theory is not\\nthe idea of the formulation of a contract; it is the idea that\\nmen are mere individuals, without any social relations until\\nthey form a contract. The method by which they get out of\\ntheir individualistic condition is not the important matter;\\nrather this is the fact, that they are in an individualistic\\ncondition out of which they have to be got. The notion, in\\nshort, which lay in the minds of those who proposed this\\ntheory was that men in their natural state are non-social\\nunits, are a mere multitude; and that some artifice must be\\ndevised to constitute them into political society. And this\\nartifice they found in a contract which they entered into with\\none another. Maine rejects this artifice as unreal, but keeps\\nthe fundamental idea, the idea of men as a mere mass, which\\nled to it.\\nThe fact is, however, that the theory of the \"social\\norganism,\" that theory that men are not isolated non-social\\natoms, but are men only when in intrinsic relations to men,\\nhas wholly superseded the theory of men as an aggregate, as\\na heap of grains of sand needing some factitious mortar to\\nput them into semblance of order. This, indeed, does not\\nmake it incumbent upon one to accept the one theory or to\\nreject the other; the argument to authority is always open to\\nquestion; but it does make it incumbent that one rest his case\\nupon something more than a definition which begs the°ques-tion\\nquestion by its very make-up. For the picture which is drawn of\\ndemocracy is, in effect, simply an account of anarchy. To\\ndefine democracy simply as the rule of the many, as°sover-eignty\\nsovereignty chopped up into mince meat, is to define it as°abroga-tion\\nabrogation of society, as society dissolved, annihilated. When so\\ndefined, it may be easily shown to be instable to the last\\ndegree, and so difficult that a common will must be°manu-factured\\nmanufactured—if not by means of a contract, then by means of a\\ncombined action of the firm of Party and Corruption.\\nBut if we do not start with a definition of democracy\\n\\n ― 232 ―\\n                            \\nwhich makes it equivalent to the destruction of society, it\\nmay not be found so easy to derive all these evil°conse-quences\\nconsequences from it. If we start from the conception of a social\\norganism, the prima facie case stands quite otherwise. For\\nwhile in a mass, in a numerical aggregate, the ultimate\\nreality is an individual unit, and the isolated atoms are the\\n\"facts of the case,\" in an organism man is essentially a\\nsocial being. Society in its unified and structural character is\\nthe fact of the case; the non-social individual is an°abstrac-tion\\nabstraction arrived at by imagining what man would be if all his\\nhuman qualities were taken away. Society, as a real whole,\\nis the normal order, and the mass as an aggregate of isolated\\nunits is the fiction. If this be the case, and if democracy be a\\nform of society, it not only does have, but must have, a\\ncommon will; for it is this unity of will which makes it an\\norganism. A state represents men so far as they have become\\norganically related to one another, or are possessed of unity\\nof purpose and interest. But as Maine\\'s a priori definition of\\ndemocracy, based upon an exploded theory of society, does\\nnot suffice to condemn democracy, neither will a conception\\nof it which rests upon an accepted theory suffice to justify it.\\nNo one can claim that any society is wholly organized, or\\npossessed of one interest and will to the exclusion of all\\nstruggle and opposition and hostility. There are still classes\\nwithin society, circles within the classes and cliques within\\nthe circles. If it can be shown that democracy more than\\nother forms tends to multiply these subdivisions, that it\\ntends to increase this opposition; that it strengthens their\\nefficiency at the expense of the working force of the°organ-ism\\norganism—in short, that its tendencies are towards disintegration,\\ntowards mere government by the mass, on the one side, and\\nresolution into infinitesimal fragments, on the other, the case\\nagainst democracy is amply made out. But an arbitrary\\ndefinition and analysis will not serve.\\nWhat gives the democracy more than other forms of\\ngovernment the appearance of being a mere rule of a mass\\nor multitude is, without doubt, the use which it makes of\\nindividual suffrage on the one hand and majority rule on the\\nother. Since it thus appears to decide all questions of policy\\nand of men by mere weighing of numbers, it is easy to\\n\\n ― 233 ―\\n                            \\nrepresent democracy as concerned for the most part with a\\nproblem in arithmetic. Analytic abstraction, having°per-chance\\nperchance already deprived men of all their qualities due to\\ntheir social relations, now proceeds further to reduce them\\ninto merely numerical individuals, into ballot-projecting\\nunits. Then the mere accident of a few bare units more or\\nless on this side or that, seems, by bare numerical°prepon-derance\\npreponderance, to form the will of the people in this direction or\\nthat. Such is the theoretical analysis of democracy most\\noften presented to us. Many of its upholders have no more\\nadequate idea of it than this, and rest for their final support\\non the fact that after all the numerical majority would have,\\nin case of an appeal to arms, the brute force to coerce the\\nminority. Such presentations come off very poorly when\\ncompared with the sketch of an ideal aristocracy, where not\\nmere stress of numbers, but superiority in wisdom, elevation\\nin goodness, enable the few having these qualities to guide\\nthe mass without them. All Carlyle\\'s political writings rest\\ntheir lamentation on just such a conception of democracy as\\nthis numerical one, which he has set forth in a more many-\\nsided, vivid and forcible way than even Sir Henry Maine.\\nAnd the educated men of to-day, who have been trained\\nexclusively in the school of physical science, with its°tenden-cies\\ntendencies towards mechanical and mathematical abstraction,°al-most\\nalmost without exception have no notion of the meaning of\\ndemocracy other than this.\\nBut the student of society has constantly to be on his\\nguard against the abstract and purely mechanical notions\\nintroduced from the physical sciences. If he will beware of\\nsuch abstractions, he will remember that men cannot be\\nreduced for political purposes, any more than for any other,\\nto bare figure ones, marks to be placed in rows set over\\nagainst one another. A man when he comes to vote does not\\nput off from him, like a suit of old clothes, his character, his\\nwealth, his social influence, his devotion to political°inter-ests\\ninterests, and become a naked unit. He carries with him in his\\nvoting all the influence that he should have, and if he°de-serves\\ndeserves twice as much as another man, it is safe to say that he\\ndecides twice as many votes as that other man. Even if his\\ncharacter is corrupt, and his devotion to politics is from\\n\\n ― 234 ―\\n                            \\nmotives of pelf, it yet remains true that he votes, not as a\\nmere unit, but as a representative of the social organism. It\\nis only because society allows him, nay, grants him power on\\nsuch grounds, that he can use it. His very corruption is the\\nexpression of society through him. A vote, in other words, is\\nnot an impersonal counting of one; it is a manifestation of\\nsome tendency of the social organism through a member of\\nthat organism.\\nBut this only touches the matter. There still appears to\\nbe in majority rule an instrument for putting all on a dead\\nlevel, and allowing numerical surplus to determine the°out-come\\noutcome. But the heart of the matter is found not in the voting\\nnor in the counting the votes to see where the majority lies.\\nIt is in the process by which the majority is formed. The\\nminority are represented in the policy which they force the\\nmajority to accept in order to be a majority; the majority\\nhave the right to \"rule\" because their majority is not the mere\\nsign of a surplus in numbers, but is the manifestation of the\\npurpose of the social organism. Were this not so, every\\nelection would be followed by a civil war; there would be no\\nneed of writing concerning the weakness of popular°govern-ment\\ngovernment; it would be the only striking fact about democracy.\\nI know of no one by whom this matter of majority rule is\\nbetter stated than by the late Governor Tilden—whose\\nopinion is the more worth quoting in this connection because\\nhe too saw in democracy only a device for carrying on°govern-ment\\ngovernment. He calls attention to the fact that generally the°dif-ference\\ndifference between the minority and the majority party in a\\ngeneral election does not exceed five per cent of the entire\\nvote. Instead of jumping at the conclusion that thus a small\\nproportion of the population really determines the policy of\\nthe whole, he sees that the small numerical difference is in\\nreality testimony to the coinciding of the two parties. \"The\\nminority,\" he says, \"adopts enough of the ideas of the°ma-jority\\nmajority to attract those who are nearest to the line of division;\\nand the majority in struggling to reclaim them makes°con-cessions\\nconcessions. The issue is thus constantly shifting with the°wa-vering\\nwavering tide of battle, until the policy which at last prevails\\nhas become adjusted so as nearly to represent the average\\nsense of the whole people. In shaping the policy which\\n\\n ― 235 ―\\n                            \\nemerges from the conflict the minority acts a part scarcely\\nless important than the majority.\" (Tilden, Writings and\\nSpeeches, vol. i, p. 290.) Or as he sums up the whole matter:\\n\"In trying to acquire the means to govern, the majority\\nbecomes qualified to govern.\" The only case in which such statements cease to represent facts is\\nwhen a constitutional amendment is submitted to a people, and they are\\ncompelled to vote yes or no, with no possibility of modification oramend-ment\\namendment. But this is only an argument against the plebiscitum, (for such this\\nprocess really is) not against democracy.\\n»1 When, therefore, we hear\\nthe derider of democracy discrediting it by declaring that\\nthrough manhood suffrage and majority rule all are put on\\na level, with no quality concerned but their numerical, we\\nmay be confident that he has only the most superficial view\\nof the matter, and that the process of finding out the policy\\nof the majority is the process by which the social organism\\nweighs considerations and forms its consequent judgment;\\nthat the voting of the individual represents in reality, a\\ndeliberation, a tentative opinion on the part of the whole\\norganism.\\nWe must now turn to the other side of the picture. The\\ntheory which makes of democratic society a mere mass,\\nmakes, on the other hand, the democratic citizen a mere\\nminced morsel of this mass, a disorganized fragment. If,\\nhowever, society be truly described as organic, the citizen is\\na member of the organism, and, just in proportion to the\\nperfection of the organism, has concentrated within himself\\nits intelligence and will. Disguise it as we may, this theory\\ncan have but one result, that of the sovereignty of the\\ncitizen. There are various theories which have served to\\nkeep this in the background, and to hide the fact that the\\nordinary American expression of the sovereignty of every\\nelector is not a mere exaggerated burst of individualistic\\nfeeling, fostered through crude Fourth of July patriotism,\\nbut is the logical outcome of the organic theory of society.\\nThere is the French theory which makes sovereignty\\nthe natural (that is, the pre-political, even the non-political)\\nattribute of the people; a trait inhering in the people by mere\\nstress of their including everyone within themselves,°with-out\\nwithout respect to organization. There is the German theory,\\nwhich, although recognizing professedly the organic°concep-tion\\n ― 236 ―\\n                            \\nconception, rids it of its significance in this respect by giving a\\nphysiological sense to the term, by interpreting the term in\\nanalogy with the human body. Thus Bluntschli, in spite of\\nall that there is valuable in him, cannot free himself from the\\nidea that since society is an organism it must have°some-thing\\nsomething corresponding to the division of sexes, to the limbs, to\\nthe trunk, and to the head. Just as the head represents the\\nwisdom and control of the body, so the mystic attribute of\\nsovereignty, which is diffused indeed in a vague way\\nthrough the nation, gets reality only in the aureole that rests\\nupon the monarch. The English theory, as presented by\\nHobbes and worked out by Austin, virtually makes it consist\\nin irresponsible power. According to one theory, sovereignty\\nis located in the people as a whole, one might say as a mob;\\naccording to another it is latent in the nation as a definite\\npolitical body, but manifest only in the head of the nation;\\naccording to the third (the one adopted here at least by\\nMaine) it is situated in whatever portions of the state have\\nthe power to make, alter and enforce laws without appeal. If\\nwe take the latter notion, sovereignty is simply power to do\\nthis or that. It follows that in the democratic state°(accord-ing\\n(according to Maine\\'s conception of it as a multitude) this power\\nmust be divided into fragments, each citizen having simply\\nhis fractional part of the total amount of sovereignty at\\ncommand. Thus the exercise of sovereignty is a question of\\ndivision, just as the formation of a common will is one in\\naddition. Given so much sovereignty, and so many citizens,\\nhow much does each member have? The individual, the\\nultimate unit, thus becomes an n-millionth of political\\npower. But if we really adopt the organic conception of\\nsociety, the case stands quite otherwise. The attempt to\\nmake the organic theory work only in one direction, namely,\\nas applicable to society but not to its members, is to deny the\\ntheory. This is as much an account of the individual as it is\\nof the whole. One who has really adopted the notion can say\\nnot less, but more than any one else, that society exists for\\nand by individuals. But it is because he has given up the\\nfiction of isolated unsocial units, and has realized that the\\nindividual embodies and realizes within himself the spirit\\nand will of the whole organism.\\n\\n ― 237 ―\\n                            \\nThis is not the place for an examination of the°concep-tion\\nconception of organism; but it must be remembered that it is a\\nthoroughly reciprocal conception. The animal body is not\\nthe type of an organism, because the members, the organs,\\nhave their life, after all, only as parts, conditioned by their\\nexternal space relations. They indeed participate in the life\\nof the whole, while the whole lives in them, giving them\\ntheir activity. But they are absorbed in this whole. The\\nwhole has not given its life to them so freely that they can\\ntake on the appearance of independent lives, isolated in\\nspace. The organic relation is incomplete. But human°so-ciety\\nsociety represents a more perfect organism. The whole lives\\ntruly in every member, and there is no longer the°appear-ance\\nappearance of physical aggregation, or continuity. The organism\\nmanifests itself as what it truly is, an ideal or spiritual life, a\\nunity of will. If then, society and the individual are really\\norganic to each other, then the individual is society°concen-trated\\nconcentrated. He is not merely its image or mirror. He is the\\nlocalized manifestation of its life. And if, as actually°hap-pens\\nhappens, society be not yet possessed of one will, but partially is\\none and partially has a number of fragmentary and warring\\nwills, it yet follows that so far as society has a common\\npurpose and spirit, so far each individual is not°representa-tive\\nrepresentative of a certain proportionate share of the sum total of will,\\nbut is its vital embodiment. And this is the theory, often\\ncrudely expressed, but none the less true in substance, that\\nevery citizen is a sovereign, the American theory, a doctrine\\nwhich in grandeur has but one equal in history, and that its\\nfellow, namely, that every man is a priest of God.\\nIn conception, at least, democracy approaches most\\nnearly the ideal of all social organization; that in which the\\nindividual and society are organic to each other. For this\\nreason democracy, so far as it is really democracy, is the\\nmost stable, not the most insecure, of governments. In every\\nother form of government there are individuals who are not\\norgans of the common will, who are outside of the political\\nsociety in which they live, and are, in effect, aliens to that\\nwhich should be their own commonwealth. Not°participat-ing\\nparticipating in the formation or expression of the common will, they\\ndo not embody it in themselves. Having no share in society,\\n\\n ― 238 ―\\n                            \\nsociety has none in them. Such is the origin of that body of\\nirreconcilables which Maine, with inverted logic, attributes\\nto democracy.\\nWe have thus far analyzed the popular numerical°con-ception\\nconception of democracy as bearing upon the notions of the\\ncommon will and of sovereignty. We have now to examine it\\nin its relation to the theory of government. From this°quanti-tative\\nquantitative notion it necessarily follows that government comes\\ninto being by the process stated by Maine, that of°delega-tion\\ndelegation. If society is only a mass or aggregate, it must call\\ngovernment into being by some artificial means. There then\\nexist two classes, one of governors, one of governed, and the\\nonly question is as to which is the real master, which the real\\nservant. Democracy, like every other form of government,\\nhas these two classes set over against each other, but it\\nreverses the relation existing in aristocracy. But, once\\nmore, if society be organic, the notion of two classes, one of\\nwhich is inferior to the other, falls to the ground. The basal\\nconception, here, is of unity, and all distinctions must occur\\nwithin and on account of this unity. The organism must\\nhave its spiritual organs; having a common will, it must\\nexpress it. A national consciousness which does not give\\nitself outward reality, which does not objectify itself, is like\\nany other consciousness in similar plight—simply°non-exis-tent\\nnon-existent. There is, indeed, a popular but none the less superficial\\nmode of speech which identifies the government and the\\nstate. This is as if a physiologist were to identify seeing with\\nthe eye, or even with the whole body. The eye is the body\\norganized for seeing, and just so government is the state\\norganized for declaring and executing its judgments.°Gov-ernment\\nGovernment is to the state what language is to thought; it not\\nonly communicates the purposes of the state, but in so doing\\ngives them for the first time articulation and generality.\\nThe chief bearing of this upon our present discussion\\nlies in the fact that it does away with the dualism inherent in\\nthe delegation theory. Government does not mean one class\\nor side of society set over against the other. The government\\nis not made up of those who hold office, or who sit in the\\nlegislature. It consists of every member of political society.\\nAnd this is true of democracy, not less, but more, than of\\n\\n ― 239 ―\\n                            \\nother forms. The democratic formula that government°de-rives\\nderives its powers from the consent of the governed, like the\\ntheory of the sovereignty of the political citizen, has suffered\\nas much at the hands of its friends as of its enemies; but its\\ntrue significance is not thereby destroyed. It means that in\\ndemocracy, at all events, the governors and the governed are\\nnot two classes, but two aspects of the same fact—the fact of\\nthe possession by society of a unified and articulate will. It\\nmeans that government is the organ of society, and is as\\ncomprehensive as society. Here, as before, we may reverse\\nMaine\\'s argument and say that democracy, since it more\\nfully conforms to the ideal of society, is more stable than\\naristocracy. Wherever government is a matter of birth, of\\nheredity, of wealth, of superior \"social\" standing, in a word,\\nof privilege, society is still unorganized, and in so far,°cha-otic\\nchaotic. There are two wills; the governors and the governed\\nare two separate classes. Unless there is complete despotism\\nor stagnation, there is constant clashing of the two wills\\ncontained, and a constant shifting of power. There is a\\ncondition of unstable equilibrium. What Plato said of his\\nideal state, we may with greater truth say of democracy:\\n\"What simplicity is this that you should use the term \\'state\\'\\nof any but ours! Other states may indeed be spoken of more\\ngrandiloquently and in the plural number-for they are\\nmany. Any ordinary state, however small, is indeed two\\nstates at war with each other, and in either division there are\\nmany smaller states.\" (Republic iv. 423.) And again as\\nPlato acutely remarks: \"All political changes originate in\\ndivisions of the governing power, for a government which is\\nunited, however small, cannot be moved.\" (Republic viii.\\n545.)\\nWe have completed the first part of our examination.\\nWe have considered the theory of democratic government\\nsuggested by Sir Henry Maine, so far as it relates to the\\nconception of the common will, of the individual citizen, and\\nof the origin of government. We have now to see whether\\nwe can stop with the idea of democracy as merely a form of\\ngovernment, or whether it implies something more. James\\nRussell Lowell is a man of letters, not a professed student of\\npolitics, and yet where he says of democracy that he is\\n\\n ― 240 ―\\n                            \\n\"speaking of a sentiment, a spirit, and not of a form of\\ngovernment, for this is but the outgrowth of the latter and\\nnot its cause,\" we must recognize that the weight of history\\nand of politics is on his side, as it is not on that of Maine.\\nThe conception that democracy and aristocracy are°expedi-ents\\nexpedients for reaching certain jural ends, for exercising certain\\npolice powers, for compelling obedience, and that the sole\\nquestion is as to what piece of machinery can accomplish\\nthis most efficiently, and with the greatest stability and\\neconomy, is one which has no justification outside of°ab-stract\\nabstract theory. It is the relic of the time when governmental\\npolities were regarded as articles of clothing, to be cut and\\nsewed by any acute political tailor, and fitted to any nation.\\nIt belongs to a time when it was thought that a constitution\\ncould be made ad hoc, and established on a tabula rasa of\\npast history, also manufactured with express reference to\\nthe given case. A government springs from a vast mass of\\nsentiments, many vague, some defined, of instincts, of°aspi-rations\\naspirations, of ideas, of hopes and fears, of purposes. It is their\\nreflex and their incorporation; their projection and°out-growth\\noutgrowth. Without this basis, it is worth nothing. A gust of\\nprejudice, a blow of despotism, and it falls like a card house.\\nTo say that democracy is only a form of government is like\\nsaying that home is a more or less geometrical arrangement\\nof bricks and mortar; that the church is a building with\\npews, pulpit and spire. It is true; they certainly are so much.\\nBut it is false; they are so infinitely more. Democracy, like\\nany other polity, has been finely termed the memory of an\\nhistoric past, the consciousness of a living present, the ideal\\nof the coming future. Democracy, in a word, is a social, that\\nis to say, an ethical conception, and upon its ethical°signifi-cance\\nsignificance is based its significance as governmental. Democracy\\nis a form of government only because it is a form of moral\\nand spiritual association.\\nBut so ^is aristocracy. What is the difference? What\\ndistinguishes the ethical basis and ideal of one from that of\\nthe other? It may appear a roundabout way to reach a simple\\nend, to refer to Plato and to Greek life to get data for an\\nanswer; but I know of no way in which I can so easily bring\\nout what seems to me the truth. The Platonic Republic is a\\n\\n ― 241 ―\\n                            \\nsplendid and imperishable formulation of the aristocratic\\nideal. If it had no value for philosophical reasons, if its\\ntheory of morals, of reality and of knowledge had°disap-peared\\ndisappeared as utterly as the breezes which swept the grasses\\nunder the plane tree by which Plato and his disciples sat and\\ntalked, the Republic would be immortal as the summary of\\nall that was best and most permanent in Greek life, of its\\nways of thinking and feeling, and of its ideals. But the\\nRepublic is more; it seizes upon the heart of the ethical\\nproblem, the relation of the individual to the universal, and\\nstates a solution. The question of the Republic is as to the\\nideal of men\\'s conduct; the answer is such a development of\\nman\\'s nature as brings him into complete harmony with the\\nuniverse of spiritual relations, or, in Platonic language, the\\nstate. This universe, in turn, is man writ large; it is the\\nmanifestation, the realization of the capacities of the°individ-ual\\nindividual. Such a development of the individual that he shall be in\\nharmony with all others in the state, that is, that he shall\\npossess as his own the unified will of the community; that is\\nthe end both of politics and of ethics. Nothing could be more\\naside from the mark than to say that the Platonic ideal\\nsubordinates and sacrifices the individual to the state. It\\ndoes, indeed, hold that the individual can be what he ought\\nto be, can become what, in idea, he is, only as a member of a\\nspiritual organism, called by Plato the state, and, in losing\\nhis own individual will, acquiring that of this larger reality.\\nBut this is not loss of selfhood or personality, it is its\\nrealization. The individual is not sacrificed; he is brought to\\nreality in the state.\\nWe certainly cannot find here any ground upon which\\nto distinguish the aristocratic from the democratic ideal. But\\nwe have not asked how this unity of the individual and the\\nuniverse, this perfect man in the perfect state, is to be\\nbrought about. Here lies the distinction sought for; it is not a\\nquestion of end, but of means. According to Plato (and the\\naristocratic idea everywhere), the multitude is incapable of\\nforming such an ideal and of attempting to reach it. Plato is\\nthe true author of the doctrine of the \"remnant.\" There is,\\nin his words, \"no chance of perfection either in states or in\\nindividuals until a necessity is laid upon the small class of\\n\\n ― 242 ―\\n                            \\ncaring for the state.\" It is to the one wise man, or to the few,\\nthat Plato looks for redemption. Once found these are to be\\ngiven absolute control, and are to see to it that each°individ-ual\\nindividual is placed in such a position in the state that he may make\\nperfect harmony with the others, and at the same time\\nperform that for which he is best fitted, and thus realize the\\ngoal of life—\"Justice,\" in Plato\\'s word.\\nSuch is the barest outline of the most perfect picture of\\nthe aristocratic ideal which history affords. The few best,\\nthe aristoi; these know and are fitted for rule; but they are to\\nrule not in their own interests but in that of society as a\\nwhole, and, therefore, in that of every individual in society.\\nThey do not bear rule over the others; they show them what\\nthey can best do, and guide them in doing it. There is no\\nneed to dwell upon the charm, upon the attractiveness of the\\naristocratic ideal. The best witness to it is in the long line of\\ngreat men who have reiterated with increasing emphasis\\nthat all will go wrong, until the few who know and are\\nstrong, are put in power, while others, foregoing the°asser-tion\\nassertion of their individuality, submit to superior wisdom and\\ngoodness.\\nBut history has been making the other way. If history\\nbe, as Strauss said, a sound aristocrat, then history is°com-mitting\\ncommitting suicide. It is working towards something which is\\nnot history. The aristocratic ideal, spite of all its attractions,\\nis not equal to reality; it is not equal to the actual forces\\nanimating men as they work in history. It has failed because\\nit is found that the practical consequence of giving the few\\nwise and good power is that they cease to remain wise and\\ngood. They become ignorant of the needs and requirement\\nof the many; they leave the many outside the pale with no\\nreal share in the commonwealth. Perchance they even°wil-fully\\nwilfully use their wisdom and strength for themselves, for the\\nassertion of privilege and status and to the detriment of the\\ncommon good. The aristocratic society always limits the\\nrange of men who are regarded as participating in the state,\\nin the unity of purpose and destiny; and it always neglects to\\nsee that those theoretically included really obtain their well\\nbeing. Every forward democratic movement is followed by\\nthe broadening of the circle of the state, and by more°effec-tive\\n ― 243 ―\\n                            \\neffective oversight that every citizen may be insured the rights\\nbelonging to him.\\nBut even were it possible to find men so wise as not to\\nignore the misery and degradation beyond their immediate\\nken, men so good as to use their power only for the°commu-nity\\ncommunity, there is another fact which is the condemnation of the\\naristocratic theory. The ethical ideal is not satisfied merely\\nwhen all men sound the note of harmony with the highest\\nsocial good, so be it that they have not worked it out for\\nthemselves. Were it granted that the rule of the aristoi\\nwould lead to the highest external development of society\\nand the individual, there would still be a fatal objection.\\nHumanity cannot be content with a good which is procured\\nfrom without, however high and otherwise complete that\\ngood. The aristocratic idea implies that the mass of men are\\nto be inserted by wisdom, or, if necessary, thrust by force,\\ninto their proper positions in the social organism. It is true,\\nindeed, that when an individual has found that place in\\nsociety for which he is best fitted and is exercising the\\nfunction proper to that place, he has obtained his completest\\ndevelopment, but it is also true (and this is the truth omitted\\nby aristocracy, emphasized by democracy) that he must find\\nthis place and assume this work in the main for himself.\\nDemocracy does not differ from aristocracy in its goal. The\\nend is not mere assertion of the individual will as individual;\\nit is not disregard of law, of the universal; it is complete\\nrealization of the law, namely of the unified spirit of the\\ncommunity. Democracy differs as to its means. This°univer-sal\\nuniversal, this law, this unity of purpose, this fulfilling of function\\nin devotion to the interests of the social organism, is not to be\\nput into a man from without. It must begin in the man\\nhimself, however much the good and the wise of society\\ncontribute. Personal responsibility, individual initiation,\\nthese are the notes of democracy. Aristocracy and°democ-racy\\ndemocracy both imply that the actual state of society exists for the\\nsake of realizing an end which is ethical, but aristocracy\\nimplies that this is to be done primarily by means of special\\ninstitutions or organizations within society, while democracy\\nholds that the ideal is already at work in every personality,\\nand must be trusted to care for itself. There is an individual\\n\\n ― 244 ―\\n                            \\nism in democracy which there is not in aristocracy; but it is\\nan ethical, not a numerical individualism; it is an°individual-ism\\nindividualism of freedom, of responsibility, of initiative to and for the\\nethical ideal, not an individualism of lawlessness. In one\\nword, democracy means that personality is the first and final\\nreality. It admits that the full significance of personality can\\nbe learned by the individual only as it is already presented to\\nhim in objective form in society; it admits that the chief\\nstimuli and encouragements to the realization of personality\\ncome from society; but it holds, none the less, to the fact that\\npersonality cannot be procured for any one, however°de-graded\\ndegraded and feeble, by any one else, however wise and\\nstrong. It holds that the spirit of personality indwells in\\nevery individual and that the choice to develop it must\\nproceed from that individual. From this central position of\\npersonality result the other notes of democracy, liberty,\\nequality, fraternity,—words which are not mere words to\\ncatch the mob, but symbols of the highest ethical idea which\\nhumanity has yet reached—the idea that personality is the\\none thing of permanent and abiding worth, and that in every\\nhuman individual there lies personality.\\nBy way of illustration (and what is said in the°remain-der\\nremainder of this paper is only by way of illustration), let us take\\nthe notion of liberty. Plato gives a vivid illustration of what\\nhe means by democratic freedom. It is doing as one likes. It\\nis ordering life as one pleases. It is thinking and acting as\\none has a mind to. Liberty in a democracy can have no limit.\\nIts result is loss of reverence and of order. It is the denial of\\nmoderation, of the principle of limit. Democratic liberty is\\nthe following out of individual wills, of particular desires, to\\nthe utmost degree. It has no order or law (Republic viii.\\n557-563). In a word, it is the extreme assertion of°individu-alism\\nindividualism, resulting in anarchy. In this conception of liberty he\\nhas been followed by all of the anti-democratic school. But\\nfrom the democratic standpoint, it must be remembered that\\nthe individual is something more than the individual,\\nnamely, a personality. His freedom is not mere°self-asser-tion\\nself-assertion, nor unregulated desire. You cannot say that he knows\\nno law; you must say that he knows no law but his own, the\\nlaw of personality; no law, in other words, externally°im-posed\\n ― 245 ―\\n                            \\nimposed, however splendid the authority, and undoubted the\\ngoodness of those that impose it. Law is the objective°ex-pression\\nexpression of personality. It is not a limitation upon individual\\nfreedom; it is correlative with it. Liberty is not a numerical\\nnotion of isolation; it is the ethical idea that personality is the\\nsupreme and only law, that every man is an absolute end in\\nhimself. The democratic ideal includes liberty, because°de-mocracy\\ndemocracy without initiation from within, without an ideal\\nchosen from within and freely followed from within, is°noth-ing\\nnothing.\\nAgain, for illustration, take the notion of equality. If\\nwe heed the aristocratic school, we learn that equality means\\nnumerical equality, that one number one is just as good as\\nany other number one. Conceiving it to refer to bald°individ-uality\\nindividuality, they think its inevitable outcome, logical if not°histor-ical\\nhistorical, is an equal division of all things from virtue to wealth.\\nDemocracy is condemned because it regards as equal the\\nworst and the best of men, the wisest and the most ignorant.\\nIt is condemned because it is said to aim at an equal°distribu-tion\\ndistribution of wealth and of the happiness that grows from material\\npossessions and surroundings. It is said that it is both foolish\\nand wicked to attempt by the lie of equality to blind one\\'s\\neyes to the differences of men in wisdom, virtue, and°indus-try\\nindustry; that upon these differences, indeed, rests the whole\\nstructure of society with its necessary grades of°subordina-tion\\nsubordination and service; and that the only society which is either\\nstable or progressive is one in which the motives of°inequal-ity\\ninequality, both political and industrial, have fair play. As Maine\\nsays, the motives which have always impelled mankind to\\nthe production of increasing industrial resources are such as\\ninfallibly entail inequality in its distribution. It is the never-\\nending struggle for existence, the private war which makes\\none man strive to climb upon the shoulders of another and\\nstay there, which have been the springs to action. Take them\\naway, introduce equality, and you have no motive to°prog-ress\\nprogress.\\nWhat shall we say to this indictment? Simply that it is\\nbeside the mark. As relates to democracy, it corresponds to\\nno reality. Equality is not an arithmetical, but an ethical\\nconception. Personality is as universal as humanity; it is\\n\\n ― 246 ―\\n                            \\nindifferent to all distinctions which divide men from men.\\nWherever you have a man, there you have personality, and\\nthere is no trace by which one personality may be°distin-guished\\ndistinguished from another so as to be set above or below. It\\nmeans that in every individual there lives an infinite and\\nuniversal possibility; that of being a king and priest.°Aris-tocracy\\nAristocracy is blasphemy against personality. It is the doctrine\\nof the elect few applied not to some life in the future, but to\\nall relations of humanity. Hero-worship means man°de-spised\\ndespised. The true meaning of equality is synonymous with\\nthe definition of democracy given by James Russell Lowell.\\nIt is the form of society in which every man has a chance\\nand knows that he has it—and we may add, a chance to\\nwhich no possible limits can be put, a chance which is truly\\ninfinite, the chance to become a person. Equality, in short, is\\nthe ideal of humanity; an ideal in the consciousness of which\\ndemocracy lives and moves.\\nOne aspect of the indictment remains to be touched—\\nthe nature of industrial equality, or the supposed tendency of\\ndemocracy towards socialism, if not communism. And there\\nis no need to beat about the bush in saying that democracy is\\nnot in reality what it is in name until it is industrial, as well\\nas civil and political. Such a condition is indeed far enough\\naway; on this point, democracy is an ideal of the future, not\\na starting point. In this respect, society is still a sound\\naristocrat. And the reflex influence of this upon our civil and\\npolitical organization is such that they are only imperfectly\\ndemocratic. For their sakes, therefore, as well as for that of\\nindustrial relations, a democracy of wealth is a necessity.\\nAll that makes such assertions seem objectionable is\\nthat this democracy of wealth is represented, often by its\\nadherents, always by its opponents, as if it meant the°numeri-cal\\nnumerical division into equal portions of all wealth, and its°numeri-cal\\nnumerical redistribution. But all that has been said in this paper\\nhas been said in vain, unless it be now recognized that\\ndemocracy is anything but a numerical notion; and that the\\nnumerical application of it is as much out of place here as it\\nis everywhere else. What is meant in detail by a democracy\\nof wealth we shall not know until it is more of a reality than\\nit is now. In general, however, it means and must mean that\\n\\n ― 247 ―\\n                            \\nall industrial relations are to be regarded as subordinate to\\nhuman relations, to the law of personality. Numerical°iden-tity\\nidentity is not required, it is not even allowed; but it is absolutely\\nrequired that industrial organization shall be made a social\\nfunction. And if this expression again seems objectionable, it\\nis because it is interpreted to mean that in some way society,\\nas a whole, to the abolition of all individual initiative and\\nresult, is to take charge of all those undertakings which we\\ncall economic. It seems to imply socialism in the sense in\\nwhich that mode of life destroys that individual°responsibil-ity\\nresponsibility and activity which are at the very heart of modern life.\\nBut when we are told that the family is a social institution,\\nand that life in the family is a social function, do we°under-stand\\nunderstand this to mean that it is a form of existence in which\\nall individuality is renounced, and an artificial entity created\\nwhich absorbs the rightful activities of the individual? I\\nthink not; we mean that the family is an ethical community,\\nand that life in the family conforms to its idea only when the\\nindividual realizes oneness of interest and purpose with it.\\nAnd this, in kind, is precisely what is meant when we\\nspeak of industrial relations as being necessarily social; we\\nmean that they are to become the material of an ethical\\nrealization; the form and substance of a community of good\\n(though not necessarily of goods) wider than any now\\nknown: that as the family, largely in its best examples, the\\nstate somewhat, though in a less degree, mean unity of\\npurpose and interest, so economic society must mean unity\\nof interest and purpose. The truth is that in these matters we\\nare still largely in the intellectual bounds which bound pre-\\nChristian thought. We still think of life as having two parts,\\none animal, the other truly human and therefore truly°ethi-cal\\nethical. The getting and distributing of the material benefits of\\nlife are regarded as indeed a means to the possibility of the\\nhigher life, the life of men in their distinctively human\\nrelations, but as in themselves wholly outside of that life.\\nBoth Plato and Aristotle, for example, always take it as a\\nmatter of course, that everything which is industrial, which\\nconcerns the getting or distributing of wealth, lies wholly\\noutside, nay, is opposed to the life of the citizen, that is, of\\nthe member of an ethical community. Plato\\'s attacks upon\\n\\n ― 248 ―\\n                            \\nthe Sophists for receiving money for teaching were on the\\nground that they thus degraded a personal (that is, a moral)\\nrelation, that of teacher and pupil, to an industrial; as if the\\ntwo were necessarily hostile. Aristotle denies that an artisan\\ncan have virtue, i.e., the qualities pertaining to the°fulfill-ment\\nfulfillment of social functions. Mechanics are, indeed,°indispensa-ble\\nindispensable to the state, \"but not all who are indispensable to the\\nstate are citizens.\" (And we must remember that the terms\\n\"citizen\" and \"state\" have, in Aristotle, always an ethical\\nbearing.) It was necessary that there should be some who\\nshould give themselves to that which is purely material, the\\nindustrial, in order that others might have the leisure to give\\nthemselves to the social and political, the ethical. We have,\\nnominally, at least, given up the idea that a certain body of\\nmen are to be set aside for the doing of this necessary work;\\nbut we still think of this work, and of the relations°pertain-ing\\npertaining to it, as if they were outside of the ethical realm and\\nwholly in the natural. We admit, nay, at times we claim,\\nthat ethical rules are to be applied to this industrial sphere,\\nbut we think of it as an external application. That the\\neconomic and industrial life is in itself ethical, that it is to be\\nmade contributory to the realization of personality through\\nthe formation of a higher and more complete unity among\\nmen, this is what we do not recognize; but such is the\\nmeaning of the statement that democracy must become°in-dustrial\\nindustrial.\\nI have used these illustrations simply for the sake of\\nshowing what I understand the conception of democracy to\\nmean, and to show that the ordinary objections to democracy\\nrest upon ideas which conceive of it after the type of an\\nindividualism of a numerical character; and have tried to\\nsuggest that democracy is an ethical idea, the idea of a\\npersonality, with truly infinite capacities, incorporate with\\nevery man. Democracy and the one, the ultimate, ethical\\nideal of humanity are to my mind synonyms. The idea of\\ndemocracy, the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity,\\nrepresent a society in which the distinction between the\\nspiritual and the secular has ceased, and as in Greek theory,\\nas in the Christian theory of the Kingdom of God, the\\nchurch and the state, the divine and the human organization\\n\\n ― 249 ―\\n                            \\nof society are one. But this, you will say, is idealism. In\\nreply, I can but quote James Russell Lowell once more and\\nsay that \"it is indeed idealism, but that I am one of those\\nwho believe that the real will never find an irremovable basis\\ntill it rests upon the ideal\"; and add that the best test of any\\nform of society is the ideal which it proposes for the forms of\\nits life, and the degree in which it realizes this ideal.\\n\\n ― 250 ―\\n                            \\n ― 251 ―\\n                            \\n'),\n",

In treating the Nouveaux Essais of\\nLeibniz, I have found myself obliged, at times, to violate the\\nletter of this expressed intention, in order to fulfil its spirit.\\nThe Nouveaux Essais, in spite of its being one of the two\\nmost extended philosophical writings of Leibniz, is a°com-pendium\\ncompendium of comments, rather than a connected argument or\\nexposition. It has all the suggestiveness and richness of a\\nnote-book, but with much also of its fragmentariness. I have\\ntherefore been obliged to supplement my account of it by\\nconstant references to the other writings of Leibniz, and\\noccasionally to take considerable liberty with the order of\\nthe treatment of topics. Upon the whole, this book will be\\nfound, I hope, to be a faithful reflex not only of Leibniz\\'s\\nthought, but also of his discussions in the Nouveaux Essais.\\nIn the main, the course of philosophic thought since\\nthe time of Leibniz has been such as to render almost self-\\nevident his limitations, and to suggest needed corrections\\nand amplifications. Indeed, it is much easier for those whose\\nthoughts follow the turn that Kant has given modern°think-ing\\nthinking to appreciate the defects of Leibniz than to realize his\\ngreatness. I have endeavored, therefore, in the body of the\\nwork, to identify my thought with that of Leibniz as much\\nas possible, to assume his standpoint and method, and, for\\nthe most part, to confine express criticism upon his°limita-tions\\nlimitations to the final chapter. In particular, I have attempted to\\nbring out the relations of philosophy to the growing science\\nof his times, to state the doctrine of pre-established harmony\\nas he himself meant it, and to give something like°consist-ency\\n ― 254 ―\\n                            \\nconsistency and coherency to his doctrine of material existence and\\nof nature. This last task seemed especially to require doing.\\nI have also endeavored to keep in mind, throughout,°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz\\'s relations to Locke, and to show the Nouveaux Essais as\\ntypical of the distinction between characteristic British and\\nGerman thought.\\n\\n ― 255 ―\\n                            \\n1: The Man\"He who knows me only by my writings does not know\\nme,\" said Leibniz. These words—true, indeed, of every\\nwriter, but true of Leibniz in a way which gives a peculiar\\ninterest and charm to his life—must be our excuse for°pref-acing\\nprefacing what is to be said of his New Essays Concerning the\\nHuman Understanding with a brief biographical sketch.\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig, June\\n21, 1646. His father, who died when Leibniz was only six\\nyears old, was a professor in the university and a notary of\\nconsiderable practice. From him the future philosopher\\nseems to have derived his extraordinary industry and love of\\ndetail. Such accounts as we have of him show no traces of\\nthe wonderful intellectual genius of his son, but only a\\ndiligent, plodding, faithful, and religious man, a thoroughly\\nconscientious husband, jurist, and professor. Nor in the lines\\nof physical heredity can we account for the unique career of\\nLeibniz by his mother\\'s endowments. The fact, however,\\nthat she was patient in all trial, living in peace with her\\nneighbors, anxious for unity and concord with all people,\\neven with those not well disposed to her, throws great light\\nupon the fundamental trait of Leibniz\\'s ethical nature. As in\\nso many cases, it is the inherited moral characteristics which\\nform the basis of the intellectual nature. The love of unity\\nwhich was a moral trait in Leibniz\\'s mother became in him\\nthe hunger for a harmonious and unified mental world; the\\nfather\\'s devotion to detail showed itself as the desire for\\nknowledge as minute and comprehensive as it was°inter-re-lated\\ninter-related.\\nLeft without his father, he was by the advice of a\\ndiscerning friend allowed free access to the library. Leibniz\\n\\n ― 256 ―\\n                            \\nnever ceased to count this one of the greatest fortunes of his\\nlife. Writing in after years to a friend, he says:—\\n\"When I lost my father, and was left without any\\ndirection in my studies, I had the luck to get at books in all\\nlanguages, of all religions, upon all sciences, and to read\\nthem without any regular order, just as my own impulse led\\nme. From this I obtained the great advantage that I was\\nfreed from ordinary prejudices, and introduced to many\\nthings of which I should otherwise never have thought.\"\\nIn a philosophical essay, in which he describes himself\\nunder the name of Guilielmus Pacidius, he says:—\\n\"Wilhelm Friedlieb, a German by birth, who lost his\\nfather in his early years, was led to study through the innate\\ntendency of his spirit; and the freedom with which he moved\\nabout in the sciences was equal to this innate impulse. He\\nburied himself, a boy eight years old, in a library, staying\\nthere sometimes whole days, and, hardly stammering Latin,\\nhe took up every book which pleased his eyes. Opening and\\nshutting them without any choice, he sipped now here, now\\nthere, lost himself in one, skipped over another, as the\\nclearness of expression or of content attracted him. He\\nseemed to be directed by the Tolle et lege of a higher voice.\\nAs good fortune would have it, he gave himself up to the\\nancients, in whom he at first understood nothing, by degrees\\na little, finally all that was really necessary, until he assumed\\nnot only a certain coloring of their expression, but also of\\ntheir thought,—just as those who go about in the sun, even\\nwhile they are occupied with other things, get sun-\\nbrowned.\"\\nAnd he goes on to tell us that their influence always\\nremained with him. Their human, their important, their\\ncomprehensive ideas, grasping the whole of life in one\\nimage, together with their clear, natural, and transparent\\nmode of expression, adapted precisely to their thoughts,\\nseemed to him to be in the greatest contrast with the°writ-ings\\nwritings of moderns, without definiteness or order in expression,\\nand without vitality or purpose in thought,—\"written as if\\nfor another world.\" Thus Leibniz learned two of the great\\nlessons of his life,—to seek always for clearness of diction\\nand for pertinence and purpose of ideas.\\n\\n ― 257 ―\\n                            \\nHistorians and poets first occupied him; but when in\\nhis school-life, a lad of twelve or thirteen years, he came to\\nthe study of logic, he was greatly struck, he says, by the\\n\"ordering and analysis of thoughts which he found there.\"\\nHe gave himself up to making tables of categories and\\npredicaments, analyzing each book that he read into suitable\\ntopics, and arranging these into classes and sub-classes. We\\ncan imagine the astonishment of his playmates as he burst\\nupon them with a demand to classify this or that idea, to find\\nits appropriate predicament. Thus he was led naturally to\\nthe philosophic books in his father\\'s library,—to Plato and to\\nAristotle, to the Scholastics. Suarez, in particular, among\\nthe latter, he read; and traces of his influences are to be\\nfound in the formulation of his own philosophic system. At\\nabout this same time he took great delight in the theological\\nworks with which his father\\'s library abounded, reading\\nwith equal ease and pleasure the writings of the Lutherans\\nand of the Reformed Church, of the Jesuits and the°Jansen-ists\\nJansenists, of the Thomists and the Arminians. The result was, he\\ntells us, that he was strengthened in the Lutheran faith of\\nhis family, but, as we may easily imagine from his after life,\\nmade tolerant of all forms of faith.\\nIn 1661 the boy Leibniz, fifteen years old, entered the\\nUniversity of Leipzig. If we glance back upon his°attain-ments\\nattainments, we find him thoroughly at home in Latin, having\\nmade good progress in Greek, acquainted with the°histori-ans\\nhistorians and poets of antiquity, acquainted with the°contempo-rary\\ncontemporary range of science, except in mathematics and physics,\\ndeeply read and interested in ancient and scholastic°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy and in the current theological discussions. Of himself he\\nsays:—\\n\"Two things were of extraordinary aid to me: in the\\nfirst place, I was self-taught; and in the second, as soon as I\\nentered upon any science I sought for something new, even\\nthough I did not as yet thoroughly understand the old. I thus\\ngained two things: I did not fill my mind with things empty\\nand to be unlearned afterwards,—things resting upon the\\nassertion of the teacher, and not upon reason; and secondly,\\nI never rested till I got down to the very roots of the science\\nand reached its principles.\"\\n\\n ― 258 ―\\n                            \\nWhile there is always a temptation to force the facts\\nwhich we know of a man\\'s early life, so as to make them\\nseem to account for what appears in mature years, and to\\nfind symbolisms and analogies which do not exist, we are not\\ngoing astray, I think, if we see foreshadowed in this early\\neducation of Leibniz the two leading traits of his later\\nthought,—universality and individuality. The range of°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz\\'s investigations already marks him as one who will be\\ncontent with no fundamental principle which does not°mir-ror\\nmirror the universe. The freedom with which he carried them\\non is testimony to the fact that even at this age the idea of\\nself-development, of individual growth from within, was\\nworking upon him. In the fact, also, that he was self-taught\\nwe find doubtless the reason that he alone of the thinkers of\\nthis period did not have to retrace his steps, to take a hostile\\nattitude towards the ideas into which he was educated, and\\nto start anew upon a foundation then first built. The°devel-opment\\ndevelopment of the thought of Leibniz is so gradual, continuous,\\nand constant that it may serve as a model of the law by\\nwhich the \"monad\" acts. Is not his early acquaintance with\\nancient literature and mediæval philosophy the reason that\\nhe could afterwards write that his philosophical system\\n\"connects Plato with Democritus, Aristotle with Descartes,\\nthe Scholastics with the moderns, theology and morals with\\nreason\"? And who can fail to see in the impartiality, the\\ncomprehensiveness, of his self-education the prophecy of the\\ntime when he can write of his ideas that \"there are united in\\nthem, as in a centre of perspective, the ideas of the Sceptics\\nin attributing to sensible things only a slight degree of\\nreality; of the Pythagoreans and Platonists, who reduce all\\nto harmonies, numbers, and ideas; of Parmenides and°Plo-tinus\\nPlotinus, with their One and All; of the Stoics, with their notion\\nof necessity, compatible with the spontaneity of other\\nschools; of the vital philosophy of the Cabalists, who find\\nfeeling everywhere; of the forms and entelechies of°Aris-totle\\nAristotle and the Schoolmen, united with the mechanical°expla-nation\\nexplanation of phenomena according to Democritus and the°mod-erns\\nmoderns\"?\\nBut we must hurry along over the succeeding years of\\nhis life. In the university the study of law was his principal\\n\\n ― 259 ―\\n                            \\noccupation, as he had decided to follow in the footsteps of\\nhis father. It cannot be said that the character of the°instruc-tion\\ninstruction or of the instructors at Leipzig was such as to give\\nmuch nutriment or stimulus to a mind like that of Leibniz.\\nHe became acquainted there, however, with the Italian°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy of the sixteenth century,—a philosophy which, as\\nformulated by Cardanus and Campanella, formed the°transi-tion\\ntransition from scholastic philosophy to the \"mechanical\" mode of\\nviewing the universe. He had here also his first introduction\\nto Descartes. The consequences of the new vision opened to\\nLeibniz must be told in his own words: \"I was but a child\\nwhen I came to know Aristotle; even the Scholastics did not\\nfrighten me; and I in no way regret this now. Plato and\\nPlotinus gave me much delight, not to speak of other°philos-ophers\\nphilosophers of antiquity. Then I fell in with the writings of\\nmodern philosophy, and I recall the time when, a boy of\\nfifteen years, I went walking in a little wood near Leipzig,\\nthe Rosenthal, in order to consider whether I should hold to\\nthe doctrine of substantial forms. Finally the mechanical\\ntheory conquered, and thus I was led to the study of the\\nmathematical sciences.\"\\nTo the study of the mathematical sciences! Surely\\nwords of no mean import for either the future of Leibniz or\\nof mathematics. But his Leipzig studies did not take him\\nvery far in this new direction. Only the elements of Euclid\\nwere taught there, and these by a lecturer of such confused\\nstyle that Leibniz seems alone to have understood them. In\\nJena, however, where he went for a semester, things were\\nsomewhat better. Weigel, a mathematician of some fame, an\\nastronomer, a jurist, and a philosopher, taught there, and\\nintroduced Leibniz into the lower forms of analysis. But the\\nThirty Years\\' War had not left Germany in a state of high\\nculture, and in after years Leibniz lamented the limitations\\nof his early mathematical training, remarking that if he had\\nspent his youth in Paris, he would have enriched science\\nearlier. By 1666 Leibniz had finished his university career,\\nhaving in previous years attained the degrees of bachelor of\\nphilosophy and master of philosophy. It is significant that\\nfor the first he wrote a thesis upon the principle of°individua-tion\\nindividuation,—the principle which in later years became the basis of\\n\\n ― 260 ―\\n                            \\nhis philosophy. This early essay, however, is rather an°exhi-bition\\nexhibition of learning and of dexterity in handling logical°meth-ods\\nmethods than a real anticipation of his after-thought.\\nFor his second degree, he wrote a thesis upon the\\napplication of philosophic ideas to juridic°procedure,—con-siderations\\nprocedure,—considerations which never ceased to occupy him. At about the\\nsame time appeared his earliest independent work, De Arte\\nCombinatoria. From his study of mathematics, and°espe-cially\\nespecially of algebraic methods, Leibniz had become convinced\\nthat the source of all science is,—first, analysis; second,\\nsymbolic representation of the fundamental concepts, the\\nsymbolism avoiding the ambiguities and vagueness of°lan-guage\\nlanguage; and thirdly, the synthesis and interpretation of the\\nsymbols. It seemed to Leibniz that it ought to be possible to\\nfind the simplest notions in all the sciences, to discover\\ngeneral rules for calculating all their varieties of°combina-tion\\ncombination, and thus to attain the same certainty and generality of\\nresult that characterize mathematics. Leibniz never gave up\\nthis thought. Indeed, in spirit his philosophy is but its°appli-cation\\napplication, with the omission of symbols, on the side of the\\ngeneral notions fundamental to all science. It was also the\\nidea of his age,—the idea that inspired Spinoza and the\\nAufklärung, the idea that inspired philosophical thinking\\nuntil Kant gave it its death-blow by demonstrating the°dis-tinction\\ndistinction between the methods of philosophy and of°mathe-matical\\nmathematical and physical science.\\nIn 1666 Leibniz should have received his double°doc-torate\\ndoctorate of philosophy and of law; but petty jealousies and\\npersonal fears prevented his presenting himself for the°ex-amination\\nexamination. Disgusted with his treatment, feeling that the\\nties that bound him to Leipzig were severed by the recent\\ndeath of his mother, anxious to study mathematics further,\\nand, as he confesses, desiring, with the natural eagerness of\\nyouth, to see more of the world, he left Leipzig forever, and\\nentered upon his Wanderjahre. He was prepared to be no\\nmean citizen of the world. In his education he had gone from\\nthe historians to the poets, from the poets to the philosophers\\nand the Scholastics, from them to the theologians and\\nChurch Fathers, then to the jurists, to the mathematicians,\\nand then again to philosophy and to law.\\n\\n ― 261 ―\\n                            \\nHe first directed his steps to the University of Altdorf;\\nhere he obtained his doctorate in law, and was offered a\\nprofessorship, which he declined,—apparently because he\\nfelt that his time was not yet come, and that when it should\\ncome, it would not be in the narrow limits of a country\\nvillage. From Altdorf he went to Nürnberg; here all that\\nneed concern us is the fact that he joined a society of\\nalchemists (fraternitas roseæcrucis), and was made their\\nsecretary. Hereby he gained three things,—a knowledge of\\nchemistry; an acquaintance with a number of scientific men\\nof different countries, with whom, as secretary, he carried\\non correspondence; and the friendship of Boineburg, a°diplo-mat\\ndiplomat of the court of the Elector and Archbishop of Mainz.\\nThis friendship was the means of his removing to Frankfurt.\\nHere, under the direction of the Elector, he engaged in\\nremodelling Roman law so as to adapt it for German use, in\\nwriting diplomatic tracts, letters, and essays upon°theologi-cal\\ntheological matters, and in editing an edition of Nizolius,—a now\\nforgotten philosophical writer. One of the most noteworthy\\nfacts in connection with this edition is that Leibniz pointed\\nout the fitness of the German language for philosophical\\nuses, and urged its employment,—a memorable fact in\\nconnection with the later development of German thought.\\nAnother important tract which he wrote was one urging the\\nalliance of all the German States for the purpose of°advanc-ing\\nadvancing their internal and common interests. Here, as so often,\\nLeibniz was almost two centuries in advance of his times.\\nBut the chief thing in connection with the stay of Leibniz at\\nMainz was the cause for which he left it. Louis XIV had\\nbroken up the Triple Alliance, and showed signs of°attack-ing\\nattacking Holland and the German Empire. It was then proposed\\nto him that it would be of greater glory to himself and of\\ngreater advantage to France that he should move against\\nTurkey and Egypt. The mission of presenting these ideas to\\nthe great king was intrusted to Leibniz, and in 1672 he\\nwent to Paris.\\nThe plan failed completely,—so completely that we\\nneed say no more about it. But the journey to Paris was none\\nthe less the turning-point in the career of Leibniz. It brought\\nhim to the centre of intellectual civilization,—to a centre\\n\\n ― 262 ―\\n                            \\ncompared with which the highest attainments of disrupted\\nand disheartened Germany were comparative barbarism.\\nMolière was still alive, and Racine was at the summit of his\\nglory. Leibniz became acquainted with Arnaud, a disciple of\\nDescartes, who initiated him into the motive and spirit of his\\nmaster. Cartesianism as a system, with its scientific basis\\nand its speculative consequences, thus first became to him an\\nintellectual reality. And, perhaps most important of all, he\\nmet Huygens, who became his teacher and inspirer both in\\nthe higher forms of mathematics and in their application to\\nthe interpretation and expression of physical phenomena.\\nHis diplomatic mission took him also to London, where the\\ngrowing world of mathematical science was opened yet\\nwider to him. The name of Sir Isaac Newton need only be\\ngiven to show what this meant. From this time one of the\\ngreatest glories of Leibniz\\'s life dates,—a glory, however,\\nwhich during his lifetime was embittered by envy and°unap-preciation\\nunappreciation, and obscured by detraction and malice,—the°in-vention\\ninvention of the infinitesimal calculus. It would be interesting,\\nwere this the place, to trace the history of its discovery,—the\\ngradual steps which led to it, the physical facts as well as\\nmathematical theories which made it a necessity; but it must\\nsuffice to mention that these were such that the discovery of\\nsome general mode of expressing and interpreting the newly\\ndiscovered facts of nature was absolutely required for the\\nfurther advance of science, and that steps towards the°intro-duction\\nintroduction of the fundamental ideas of the calculus had already\\nbeen taken,—notably by Kepler, by Cavalieri, and by°Wal-lis\\nWallis. It would be interesting to follow also the course of the\\ncontroversy with Newton,—a controversy which in its\\nmethod of conduct reflects no credit upon the names of\\neither. But this can be summed up by saying that it is now\\ngenerally admitted that absolute priority belongs to Newton,\\nbut that entire independence and originality characterize\\nnone the less the work of Leibniz, and that the method of\\napproach and statement of the latter are the more°philosoph-ical\\nphilosophical and general, and, to use the words of the judicious\\nsummary of Merz, \"Newton cared more for the results than\\nthe principle, while Leibniz was in search of fundamental\\nprinciples, and anxious to arrive at simplifications and°gen-eralizations\\ngeneralizations.\"\\n\\n ― 263 ―\\n                            \\nThe death of Boineburg removed the especial reasons\\nfor the return of Leibniz to Frankfurt, and in 1676 he\\naccepted the position of librarian and private councillor at\\nthe court of Hanover. It arouses our interest and our°ques-tionings\\nquestionings to know that on his journey back he stopped at the\\nHague, and there met face to face the other future great\\nphilosopher of the time, Spinoza. But our questionings meet\\nno answer. At Hanover, the industries of Leibniz were°var-ied\\nvaried. An extract from one of his own letters, though written\\nat a somewhat later date, will give the best outline of his\\nactivities.\\n\"It is incredible how scattered and divided are my\\noccupations. I burrow through archives, investigate old\\nwritings, and collect unprinted manuscripts, with a view to\\nthrowing light on the history of Brunswick. I also receive\\nand write a countless number of letters. I have so much that\\nis new in mathematics, so many thoughts in philosophy, so\\nmany literary observations which I cannot get into shape,\\nthat in the midst of my tasks I do not know where to begin,\\nand with Ovid am inclined to cry out: \\'My riches make me\\npoor.\\' I should like to give a description of my calculating-\\nmachine; but time fails. Above all else I desire to complete\\nmy Dynamics, as I think that I have finally discovered the\\ntrue laws of material Nature, by whose means problems\\nabout bodies which are out of reach of rules now known may\\nbe solved. Friends are urging me to publish my Science of\\nthe Infinite, containing the basis of my new analysis. I have\\nalso on hand a new Characteristic, and many general°consid-erations\\nconsiderations about the art of discovery. But all these works, the\\nhistorical excepted, have to be done at odd moments. Then\\nat the court all sorts of things are expected. I have to answer\\nquestions on points in international law; on points°concern-ing\\nconcerning the rights of the various princes in the Empire: so far I\\nhave managed to keep out of questions of private law. With\\nall this I have had to carry on negotiations with the bishops\\nof Neustadt and of Meaux [Bossuet], and with Pelisson and\\nothers upon religious matters.\"\\nIt is interesting to note how the philosophic spirit, the\\ninstinct for unity and generality, showed itself even in the\\nleast of Leibniz\\'s tasks. The Duke of Brunswick imposed\\nupon Leibniz the task of drawing up a genealogical table of\\n\\n ― 264 ―\\n                            \\nhis House. Under Leibniz\\'s hands this expanded into a°his-tory\\nhistory of the House, and this in turn was the centre of an\\nimportant study of the German Empire. It was impossible\\nthat the philosopher, according to whom every real being\\nreflected the whole of the universe from its point of view,\\nshould have been able to treat even a slight phase of local\\nhistory without regarding it in its relations to the history of\\nthe world. Similarly some mining operations in the Harz\\nMountains called the attention of Leibniz to geological°mat-ters\\nmatters. The result was a treatise called Protogäa, in which\\nLeibniz gave a history of the development of the earth. Not\\ncontent with seeing in a Brunswick mountain an epitome of\\nthe world\\'s physical formation, it was his intention to make\\nthis an introduction to his political history as a sort of\\ngeographical background and foundation. It is interesting to\\nnote that the historical studies of Leibniz took him on a three\\nyears\\' journey, from 1687 to 1690, through the various\\ncourts of Europe,—a fact which not only had considerable\\ninfluence upon Leibniz himself, but which enabled him to\\ngive stimulus to scientific development in more ways and\\nplaces than one.\\nHis philosophical career as an author begins for the\\nmost part with his return to Hanover in 1690. This lies\\noutside of the scope of the present chapter, but here is a\\nconvenient place to call attention to the fact that for Leibniz\\nthe multitude of his other duties was so great that his\\nphilosophical work was the work \"of odd moments.\" There\\nis no systematic exposition; there are a vast number of\\nletters, of essays, of abstracts and memoranda published in\\nvarious scientific journals. His philosophy bears not only in\\nform, but in substance, traces of its haphazard and desultory\\norigin. Another point of interest in this connection is the\\ndegree to which, in form, at least, his philosophical writings\\nbear the impress of his cosmopolitan life. Leibniz had seen\\ntoo much of the world, too much of courts, for his thoughts\\nto take the rigid and unbending form of geometrical°exposi-tion\\nexposition suited to the lonely student of the Hague. Nor was the\\nregular progression and elucidation of ideas adapted to the\\nlater Germans, almost without exception university°profes-sors\\nprofessors, suited to the man of affairs. There is everywhere in\\n\\n ― 265 ―\\n                            \\nLeibniz the attempt to adapt his modes of statement, not\\nonly to the terminology, but even to the ideas, of the one to\\nwhom they are addressed. There is the desire to magnify\\npoints of agreement, to minimize disagreements,°character-istic\\ncharacteristic of the courtier and the diplomat. His°comprehen-siveness\\ncomprehensiveness is not only a comprehensiveness of thought, but of\\nways of exposition, due very largely, we must think, to his\\ncosmopolitan education. The result has been to the great\\ndetriment of Leibniz\\'s influence as a systematic thinker,\\nalthough it may be argued that it has aided his indirect and\\nsuggestive influence, the absorption of his ideas by men of\\nliterature, by Goethe, above all by Lessing, and his°stimulat-ing\\nstimulating effect upon science and philosophy. It is certain that the\\nattempt to systematize his thoughts, as was done by Wolff,\\nhad for its result the disappearance of all that was profound\\nand thought-exciting.\\nIf his philosophy thus reflects the manner of his daily\\nlife, the occupations of the latter were informed by the spirit\\nof his philosophy. Two of the dearest interests of Leibniz\\nremain to be mentioned,—one, the founding of academies;\\nthe other, the reconciling of religious organizations. The\\nformer testifies to his desire for comprehensiveness, unity,\\nand organization of knowledge; the latter to his desire for\\npractical unity, his dislike of all that is opposed and isolated.\\nHis efforts in the religious direction were twofold. The first\\nwas to end the theological and political controversies of the\\ntime by the reunion of the Protestant and Roman Catholic\\nChurches. It was a plan which did the greatest honor to the\\npacific spirit of Leibniz, but it was predestined to failure.\\nBoth sides made concessions,—more concessions than we of\\nto-day should believe possible. But the one thing the Roman\\nCatholic Church would not concede was the one thing which\\nthe Protestant Church demanded,—the notion of authority\\nand hierarchy. Indeed, it may be questioned whether the\\nterms on which Leibniz conceived of their reunion do not\\npoint to the greatest weakness in his philosophy,—the°tend-ency\\ntendency to overlook oppositions and to resolve all contradiction\\ninto differences of degree. Hardly had this plan fallen\\nthrough when Leibniz turned to the project of a union of the\\nLutheran and Reformed branches of the Protestant Church.\\n\\n ― 266 ―\\n                            \\nThis scheme was more hopeful, and while unrealized during\\nthe life of our philosopher, was afterwards accomplished.\\nIt is noteworthy that even before Leibniz went to Paris\\nand to London he had conceived the idea of a society of\\nlearned men for the investigation, the systematization, and\\nthe publication of scientific truth in all its varied forms,—a\\nsociety which should in breadth include the whole sphere of\\nsciences, but should not treat them as so many isolated\\ndisciplines, but as members of one system. This idea was\\nquickened when Leibniz saw the degree in which it had\\nalready been realized in the two great world-capitals. He\\nnever ceased to try to introduce similar academies wherever\\nhe had influence. In 1700 his labors bore their fruit in one\\ninstance. The Academy at Berlin was founded, and Leibniz\\nwas its first, and indeed life-long, president. But°disappoint-ment\\ndisappointment met him at Vienna, Dresden, and St. Petersburg,\\nwhere he proposed similar societies.\\nAny sketch of Leibniz\\'s life, however brief, would be\\nimperfect which did not mention the names at least of two\\nremarkable women,—remarkable in themselves, and°re-markable\\nremarkable in their friendship with Leibniz. These were°So-phia\\nSophia, grand-daughter of James I of England (and thus the\\nlink by which the House of Brunswick finally came to rule\\nover Great Britain) and wife of the Duke of Brunswick, and\\nher daughter Sophia Charlotte, wife of the first king of\\nPrussia. The latter, in particular, gave Leibniz every°en-couragement\\nencouragement. She was personally deeply interested in all\\ntheological and philosophical questions. Upon her death-\\nbed, in 1705, she is said to have told those about her that\\nthey were not to mourn for her, as she should now be able to\\nsatisfy her desire to learn about things which Leibniz had\\nnever sufficiently explained.\\nHer death marks the beginning of a period in Leibniz\\'s\\nlife which it is not pleasant to dwell upon. New rulers arose\\nthat knew not Leibniz. It cannot be said that from this time\\ntill his death in Hanover in 1716 Leibniz had much joy or\\nsatisfaction. His best friends were dead; his political°ambi-tions\\nambitions were disappointed; he was suspected of coldness and\\nunfriendliness by the courts both of Berlin and Hanover;\\nParis and Vienna were closed to him, so far as any wide\\n\\n ― 267 ―\\n                            \\ninfluence was concerned, by his religious faith; the°contro-versy\\ncontroversy with the friends of Newton still followed him. He was\\na man of the most remarkable intellectual gifts, of an energy\\nwhich could be satisfied only with wide fields of action; and\\nhe found himself shut in by narrow intrigue to a petty round\\nof courtly officialism. It is little wonder that the following\\nwords fell from his lips: \"Germany is the only country in\\nthe world that does not know how to recognize the fame of\\nits children and to make that fame immortal. It forgets\\nitself; it forgets its own, unless foreigners make it mindful of\\nits own treasures.\" A Scotch friend of Leibniz, who°hap-pened\\nhappened to be in Hanover when he died, wrote that Leibniz\\n\"was buried more like a robber than what he really was,—\\nthe ornament of his country.\" Such was the mortal end of\\nthe greatest intellectual genius since Aristotle. But genius is\\nnot a matter to be bounded in life or in death by provincial\\ncourts. Leibniz remains a foremost citizen in that \"Kingdom\\nof Spirits\" in whose formation he found the meaning of the\\nworld.\\n\\n ― 268 ―\\n                            \\n2: The Sources of His PhilosophyWhat is true of all men is true of philosophers, and of\\nLeibniz among them. Speaking generally, what they are\\nunconsciously and fundamentally, they are through°absorp-tion\\nabsorption of their antecedents and surroundings. What they are\\nconsciously and reflectively, they are through their reaction\\nupon the influence of heredity and environment. But there is\\na spiritual line of descent and a spiritual atmosphere; and in\\nspeaking of a philosopher, it is with this intellectual heredity\\nand environment, rather than with the physical, that we are\\nconcerned. Leibniz was born into a period of intellectual\\nactivity the most teeming with ideas, the most fruitful in\\nresults, of any, perhaps, since the age of Pericles. We pride\\nourselves justly upon the activity of our own century, and in\\ndiffusion of intellectual action and wide-spread application\\nof ideas the age of Leibniz could not compare with it. But\\nours is the age of diffusion and application, while his was\\none of fermentation and birth.\\nSuch a period in its earlier days is apt to be turbid and\\nunsettled. There is more heat of friction than calm light.\\nAnd such had been the case in the hundred years before\\nLeibniz. But when he arrived at intellectual maturity much\\nof the crudity had disappeared. The troubling of the waters\\nof thought had ceased; they were becoming clarified. Bacon,\\nHobbes, Descartes, each had crystallized something out of\\nthat seething and chaotic mass of new ideas which had\\nforced itself into European consciousness. Men had been\\nintroduced into a new world, and the natural result had been\\nfeelings of strangeness, and the vagaries of intellectual°wan-derings\\nwanderings. But by the day of Leibniz the intellectual bearings\\nhad been made out anew, the new mental orientation had\\nbeen secured.\\n\\n ― 269 ―\\n                            \\nThe marks of this \"new spiritual picture of the°uni-verse\\nuniverse\" are everywhere to be seen in Leibniz. His philosophy\\nis the dawning consciousness of the modern world. In it we\\nsee the very conception and birth of the modern°interpreta-tion\\ninterpretation of the world. The history of thought is one continuous\\ntestimony to the ease with which we become hardened to\\nideas through custom. Ideas are constantly precipitating\\nthemselves out of the realm of ideas into that of ways of\\nthinking and of viewing the universe. The problem of one\\ncentury is the axiom of another. What one generation stakes\\nits activity upon investigating is quietly taken for granted by\\nthe next. And so the highest reach of intellectual inspiration\\nin the sixteenth century is to-day the ordinary food of\\nthought, accepted without an inquiry as to its source, and\\nalmost without a suspicion that it has a recent historic°ori-gin\\norigin. We have to go to Bacon or to Leibniz to see the genesis\\nand growth of those ideas which to-day have become°materi-alized\\nmaterialized into axiomatic points of view and into hard-and-fast\\ncategories of thought. In reading Leibniz the idea comes\\nover us in all its freshness that there was a time when it was\\na discovery that the world is a universe, made after one plan\\nand of one stuff. The ideas of inter-relation, of the harmony\\nof law, of mutual dependence and correspondence, were not\\nalways the assumed starting-points of thought; they were\\nonce the crowning discoveries of a philosophy aglow and\\nalmost intoxicated with the splendor of its far-reaching°gen-eralizations\\ngeneralizations. I take these examples of the unity of the world,\\nthe continuity and interdependence of all within it, because\\nthese are the ideas which come to their conscious and°de-lighted\\ndelighted birth in the philosophy of Leibniz. We do not put\\nourselves into the right attitude for understanding his\\nthought until we remember that these ideas—the commonest\\ntools of our thinking—were once new and fresh, and in their\\nnovelty and transforming strangeness were the products of a\\nphilosophic interpretation of experience. Except in that later\\ncontemporary of Leibniz, the young and enthusiastic Irish\\nidealist, Berkeley, I know of no historic thinker in whom the\\nbirth-throes (joyous, however) of a new conception of the\\nworld are so evident as in Leibniz. But while in Berkeley\\nwhat we see is the young man carried away and astounded\\nby the grandeur and simplicity of a \"new way of ideas\"\\n\\n ― 270 ―\\n                            \\nwhich he has discovered, what we see in Leibniz is the\\nmature man penetrated throughout his being with an idea\\nwhich in its unity answers to the unity of the world, and\\nwhich in its complexity answers, tone to tone, to the complex\\nharmony of the world.\\nThe familiarity of the ideas which we use hides their\\ngrandeur from us. The unity of the world is a matter of\\ncourse with us; the dependent order of all within it a mere\\nstarting-point upon which to base our investigations. But if\\nwe will put ourselves in the position of Leibniz, and behold,\\nnot the new planet, but the new universe, so one, so linked\\ntogether, swimming into our ken, we shall feel something of\\nthe same exultant thrill that Leibniz felt,—an exultation not\\nindeed personal in its nature, but which arises from the\\nexpansion of the human mind face to face with an expanding\\nworld. The spirit which is at the heart of the philosophy of\\nLeibniz is the spirit which speaks in the following words:\\n\"Quin imo qui unam partem materiæ comprehenderet, idem\\ncomprehenderet totum universum ob eandem περιχώρησιν\\nquam dixi. Mea principia talia sunt, ut vix a se invicem\\ndevelli possint. Qui unum bene novit, omnia novit.\" It is a\\nspirit which feels that the secret of the universe has been\\nrendered up to it, and which breathes a buoyant optimism.\\nAnd if we of the nineteenth century have chosen to bewail\\nthe complexity of the problem of life, and to run hither and\\nthither multiplying \"insights\" and points of view till this\\nenthusiastic confidence in reason seems to us the rashness of\\nan ignorance which does not comprehend the problem, and\\nthe unity in which Leibniz rested appears cold and abstract\\nbeside the manifold richness of the world, we should not\\nforget that after all we have incorporated into our very\\nmental structure the fundamental thoughts of Leibniz,—the\\nthoughts of the rationality of the universe and of the \"reign\\nof law.\"\\nWhat was the origin of these ideas in the mind of\\nLeibniz? What influences in the philosophic succession of\\nthinkers led him in this direction? What agencies acting in\\nthe intellectual world about him shaped his ideal°reproduc-tion\\nreproduction of reality? Two causes above all others stand out with\\nprominence,—one, the discoveries and principles of modern\\n\\n ― 271 ―\\n                            \\nphysical science; the other, that interpretation of experience\\nwhich centuries before had been formulated by Aristotle.\\nLeibniz has a double interest for those of to-day who°rever-ence\\nreverence science and who hold to the historical method. His\\nphilosophy was an attempt to set in order the methods and\\nprinciples of that growing science of nature which even then\\nwas transforming the emotional and mental life of Europe;\\nand the attempt was guided everywhere by a profound and\\nwide-reaching knowledge of the history of philosophy. On\\nthe first point Leibniz was certainly not alone. Bacon,\\nHobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, each felt in his own way the\\nfructifying touch of the new-springing science, and had\\nattempted under its guidance to interpret the facts of nature\\nand of man. But Leibniz stood alone in his interest in the\\nhistory of thought. He stands alone indeed till he is greeted\\nby his compeers of the nineteenth century. To Bacon°pre-vious\\nprevious philosophy—the Greek, the scholastic—was an \"eidol\\nof the theatre.\" The human mind must be freed from its\\nbenumbing influence. To Descartes it was useless rubbish to\\nbe cleared away, that we might get a tabula rasa upon which\\nto make a fresh start. And shall Locke and the empirical\\nEnglish school, or Reid and the Scotch school, or even Kant,\\nbe the first to throw a stone at Bacon and Descartes? It was\\nreserved to Leibniz, with a genius almost two centuries in\\nadvance of his times, to penetrate the meaning of the°pre-vious\\nprevious development of reflective thought. It would be going\\nbeyond our brief to claim that Leibniz was interested in this\\nas a historical movement, or that he specially concerned\\nhimself with the genetic lines which connected the various\\nschools of thought. But we should come short of our duty to\\nLeibniz if we did not recognize his conscious and largely\\nsuccessful attempt to apprehend the core of truth in all\\nsystems, however alien to his own, and to incorporate it into\\nhis own thinking.\\nNothing could be more characteristic of Leibniz than\\nhis saying, \"I find that most systems are right in a good\\nshare of that which they advance, but not so much in what\\nthey deny\"; or than this other statement of his, \"We must\\nnot hastily believe that which the mass of men, or even of\\nauthorities, advance, but each must demand for himself the\\n\\n ― 272 ―\\n                            \\nproofs of the thesis sustained. Yet long research generally\\nconvinces that the old and received opinions are good,°pro-vided\\nprovided they be interpreted justly.\" It is in the profound union\\nin Leibniz of the principles which these quotations image\\nthat his abiding worth lies. Leibniz was interested in°affir-mations\\naffirmations, not in denials. He was interested in securing the\\nunion of the modern method, the spirit of original research\\nand independent judgment, with the conserved results of\\nprevious thought. Leibniz was a man of his times; that is to\\nsay, he was a scientific man,—the contemporary, for°exam-ple\\nexample, of men as different as Bernouilli, Swammerdam,°Huy-gens\\nHuygens, and Newton, and was himself actively engaged in the\\nprosecution of mathematics, mechanics, geology,°compara-tive\\ncomparative philology, and jurisprudence. But he was also a man of\\nAristotle\\'s times,—that is to say, a philosopher, not satisfied\\nuntil the facts, principles, and methods of science had°re-ceived\\nreceived an interpretation which should explain and unify\\nthem.\\nLeibniz\\'s acquaintance with the higher forms of°math-ematics\\nmathematics was due, as we have seen, to his acquaintance with\\nHuygens. As he made the acquaintance of the latter at the\\nsame time that he made the acquaintance of the followers of\\nDescartes, it is likely that he received his introduction to the\\nhigher developments of the scientific interpretation of nature\\nand of the philosophic interpretation of science at about the\\nsame time. For a while, then, Leibniz was a Cartesian; and\\nhe never ceased to call the doctrine of Descartes the°ante-chamber\\nantechamber of truth. What were the ideas which he received\\nfrom Descartes? Fundamentally they were two,—one about\\nthe method of truth, the other about the substance of truth.\\nHe received the idea that the method of philosophy consists\\nin the analysis of any complex group of ideas down to simple\\nideas which shall be perfectly clear and distinct; that all\\nsuch clear and distinct ideas are true, and may then be used\\nfor the synthetic reconstruction of any body of truth.°Con-cerning\\nConcerning the substance of philosophic truth, he learned that\\nnature is to be interpreted mechanically, and that the°instru-ment\\ninstrument of this mechanical interpretation is mathematics. I\\nhave used the term \"received\" in speaking of the relation of\\nLeibniz to these ideas. Yet long before this time we might\\n\\n ― 273 ―\\n                            \\nsee him giving himself up to dreams about a vast art of\\ncombination which should reduce all the ideas concerned in\\nany science to their simplest elements, and then combine\\nthem to any degree of complexity. We have already seen\\nhim giving us a picture of a boy of fifteen gravely disputing\\nwith himself whether he shall accept the doctrine of forms\\nand final causes, or of physical causes, and as gravely°decid-ing\\ndeciding that he shall side with the \"moderns\"; and that boy was\\nhimself. In these facts we have renewed confirmation of the\\ntruth that one mind never receives from another anything\\nexcepting the stimulus, the reflex, the development of ideas\\nwhich have already possessed it. But when Leibniz, with his\\nisolated and somewhat ill-digested thoughts, came in contact\\nwith that systematized and connected body of doctrines\\nwhich the Cartesians presented to him in Paris, his ideas\\nwere quickened, and he felt the necessity-that final mark of\\nthe philosophic mind—of putting them in order.\\nAbout the method of Descartes, which Leibniz adopted\\nfrom him, or rather formulated for himself under the°influ-ence\\ninfluence of Descartes, not much need be said. It was the method\\nof Continental thought till the time of Kant. It was the\\nmother of the philosophic systems of Descartes, Leibniz, and\\nSpinoza. It was equally the mother of the German°Auf-klärung\\nAufklärung and the French éclaircissement. Its fundamental\\nidea is the thought upon which rationalism everywhere\\nbases itself. It says: Reduce everything to simple notions.\\nGet clearness; get distinctness. Analyze the complex. Shun\\nthe obscure. Discover axioms; employ these axioms in\\nconnection with the simple notions, and build up from them.\\nWhatever can be treated in this way is capable of proof, and\\nonly this. Leibniz, I repeat, possessed this method in°com-mon\\ncommon with Descartes and Spinoza. The certainty and°demon-strativeness\\ndemonstrativeness of mathematics stood out in the clearest contrast\\nto the uncertainty, the obscurity, of all other knowledge.\\nAnd to them, as to all before the days of Kant, it seemed\\nbeyond doubt that the method of mathematics consists in the\\nanalysis of notions, and in their synthesis through the°me-dium\\nmedium of axioms, which are true because identical statements;\\nwhile the notions are true because clear and distinct.\\nAnd yet the method led Leibniz in a very different\\n\\n ― 274 ―\\n                            \\ndirection. One of the fundamental doctrines, for example, of\\nLeibniz is the existence everywhere of minute and obscure\\nperceptions,—which are of the greatest importance, but of\\nwhich we, at least, can never have distinct consciousness.\\nHow is this factor of his thought, which almost approaches\\nmysticism, to be reconciled with the statements just made?\\nIt is found in the different application which is made of the\\nmethod. The object of Descartes is the erection of a new\\nstructure of truth upon a tabula rasa of all former doctrines.\\nThe object of Leibniz is the interpretation of an old body of\\ntruth by a method which shall reveal it in its clearest light.\\nDescartes and Spinoza are \"rationalists\" both in their\\nmethod and results. Leibniz is a \"rationalist\" in his method;\\nbut his application of the method is everywhere controlled\\nby historic considerations. It is, I think, impossible to over-\\nemphasize this fact. Descartes was profoundly convinced\\nthat past thought had gone wrong, and that its results were\\nworthless. Leibniz was as profoundly convinced that its\\ninstincts had been right, and that the general idea of the\\nworld which it gave was correct. Leibniz would have given\\nthe heartiest assent to Goethe\\'s saying, \"Das Wahre war\\nschon längst gefunden.\" It was out of the question, then,\\nthat he should use the new method in any other than an\\ninterpreting way to bring out in a connected system and\\nunity the true meaning of the subject-matter.\\nSo much of generality for the method of Leibniz. The\\npositive substance of doctrine which he developed under\\nscientific influence affords matter for more discussion. Of\\nthe three influences which meet us here, two are still°Carte-sian\\nCartesian; the third is from the new science of biology, although\\nnot yet answering to that name. These three influences are,\\nin order: the idea that nature is to be explained°mechani-cally\\nmechanically; that this is to be brought about through the°applica-tion\\napplication of mathematics; and, from biology, the idea that all\\nchange is of the nature of continuous growth or unfolding.\\nLet us consider each in this order.\\nWhat is meant by the mechanical explanation of°na-ture\\nnature? To answer a question thus baldly put, we must recall\\nthe kind of explanations which had satisfied the scholastic\\nmen of science. They had been explanations which, however\\n\\n ― 275 ―\\n                            \\ntrue, Leibniz says, as general principles, do not touch the\\ndetails of the matter. The explanations of natural facts had\\nbeen found in general principles, in substantial forces, in\\noccult essences, in native faculties. Now, the first contention\\nof the founders of the modern scientific movement was that\\nsuch general considerations are not verifiable, and that if\\nthey are, they are entirely aside from the point,—they fail to\\nexplain any given fact. Explanation must always consist in\\ndiscovering an immediate connection between some fact and\\nsome co-existing or preceding fact. Explanation does not\\nconsist in referring a fact to a general power, it consists in\\nreferring it to an antecedent whose existence is its necessary\\ncondition. It was not left till the times of Mr. Huxley to poke\\nfun at those who would explain some concrete phenomenon\\nby reference to an abstract principle ending in -ity. Leibniz\\nhas his word to say about those who would account for the\\nmovements of a watch by reference to a principle of°horolog-ity\\nhorologity, and of mill-stones by a fractive principle.\\nMechanical explanation consists, accordingly, in°mak-ing\\nmaking out an actual connection between two existing facts. But\\nthis does not say very much. A connection of what kind? In\\nthe first place, a connection of the same order as the facts\\nobserved. If we are explaining corporeal phenomena, we\\nmust find a corporeal link; if we are explaining phenomena\\nof motion, we must find a connection of motion. In one of his\\nfirst philosophical works Leibniz, in taking the mechanical\\nposition, states what he means by it. In the Confession of\\nNature against the Atheists he says that it must be confessed\\nto those who have revived the corpuscular theory of°Democ-ritus\\nDemocritus and Epicurus, to Galileo, Bacon, Gassendi, Hobbes,\\nand Descartes, that in explaining material phenomena°re-course\\nrecourse is to be had neither to God nor to any other°incorpo-real\\nincorporeal thing, form, or quality, but that all things are to be\\nexplained from the nature of matter and its qualities,°espe-cially\\nespecially from their magnitude, figure, and motion. The physics\\nof Descartes, to which was especially due the spread of\\nmechanical notions, virtually postulated the problem: given\\na homogeneous quantity of matter, endowed only with°ex-tension\\nextension and mobility, to account for all material phenomena.\\nLeibniz accepts this mechanical view without reserve.\\n\\n ― 276 ―\\n                            \\nWhat has been said suggests the bearing of°mathemat-ics\\nmathematics in this connection. Extension and mobility may be treated\\nby mathematics. It is indeed the business of the geometer to\\ngive us an analysis of figured space, to set before us all\\npossible combinations which can arise, assuming extension\\nonly. The higher analysis sets before us the results which\\ninevitably follow if we suppose a moving point or any°sys-tem\\nsystem of movements. Mathematics is thus the essential tool for\\ntreating physical phenomena as just defined. But it is more.\\nThe mechanical explanation of nature not only requires such\\na development of mathematics as will make it applicable to\\nthe interpretation of physical facts, but the employment of\\nmathematics is necessary for the very discovery of these\\nfacts. Exact observation was the necessity of the growing\\nphysical science; and exact observation means such as will\\nanswer the question, How much? Knowledge of nature°de-pends\\ndepends upon our ability to measure her processes,—that is, to\\nreduce distinctions of quality to those of quantity. The only\\nassurance that we can finally have that two facts are°con-nected\\nconnected in such a way as to fulfil the requirements of°scien-tific\\nscientific research, is that there is a complete quantitative°connec-tion\\nconnection between them, so that one can be regarded as the other\\ntransformed. The advance of physical science from the days\\nof Copernicus to the present has consisted, therefore, on one\\nhand, in a development of mathematics which has made it\\npossible to apply it in greater and greater measure to the\\ndiscussion and formulation of the results of experiment, and\\nto deduce laws which, when interpreted physically, will give\\nnew knowledge of fact; and, on the other, to multiply,\\nsharpen, and make precise all sorts of devices by which the\\nprocesses of nature may be measured. The explanation of\\nnature by natural processes; the complete application of\\nmathematics to nature,—these are the two thoughts which,\\nso far, we have seen to be fundamental to the development of\\nthe philosophy of Leibniz.\\nThe third factor, and that which brings Leibniz\\nnearer, perhaps, our own day than either of the others, is the\\ngrowth of physiological science. Swammerdam, Malpighi,\\nLeewenhoek,—these are names which occur and recur in the\\npages of Leibniz. Indeed, he appears to be the first of that\\n\\n ― 277 ―\\n                            \\nnow long line of modern philosophers to be profoundly\\ninfluenced by the conception of life and the categories of\\norganic growth. Descartes concerned himself indeed with\\nphysiological problems, but it was only with a view to°apply-ing\\napplying mechanical principles. The idea of the vital unity of all\\norgans of the body might seem to be attractive to one filled\\nwith the notion of the unity of all in God, and yet Spinoza\\nshows no traces of the influence of the organic conception.\\nNot until Kant\\'s famous definition of organism do we see\\nanother philosopher moved by an attempt to comprehend the\\ncategories of living structure.\\nBut it is the idea of organism, of life, which is radical\\nto the thought of Leibniz. I do not think, however, that it\\ncan truly be said that he was led to the idea simply from the\\nstate of physiological investigation at that time. Rather, he\\nhad already learned to think of the world as organic through\\nand through, and found in the results of biology°confirma-tions\\nconfirmations, apt illustrations of a truth of which he was already\\nthoroughly convinced. His writings show that there were\\ntwo aspects of biological science which especially interested\\nhim. One was the simple fact of organism itself,—the fact of\\nthe various activities of different organs occurring in°com-plete\\ncomplete harmony for one end. This presented three notions\\nvery dear to the mind of Leibniz, or rather three moments of\\nthe same idea,—the factors of activity, of unity brought\\nabout by co-ordinated action, and of an end which reveals\\nthe meaning of the activity and is the ideal expression of the\\nunity. The physiologists of that day were also occupied with\\nthe problem of growth. The generalization that all is°devel-oped\\ndeveloped ab ovo was just receiving universal attention. The\\nquestion which thrust itself upon science for solution was\\nthe mode by which ova, apparently homogeneous in°struc-ture\\nstructure, developed into the various forms of the organic°king-dom\\nkingdom. The answer given was \"evolution.\" But evolution had\\nnot the meaning which the term has to-day. By evolution\\nwas meant that the whole complex structure of man, for\\nexample, was virtually contained in the germ, and that the\\napparent phenomenon of growth was not the addition of\\nanything from without, but simply the unfolding and°magni-fying\\nmagnifying of that already existing. It was the doctrine which\\n\\n ― 278 ―\\n                            \\nafterwards gave way to the epigenesis theory of Wolff,\\naccording to which growth is not mere unfolding or°unwrap-ping\\nunwrapping, but progressive differentiation. The \"evolution\"°the-ory\\ntheory was the scientific theory of the times, however, and was\\nwarmly espoused by Leibniz. To him, as we shall see°here-after\\nhereafter, it seemed to give a key which would unlock one of the\\nproblems of the universe.\\nSuch, then, were the three chief generalizations which\\nLeibniz found current, and which most deeply affected him.\\nBut what use did he make of them? He did not become a\\nphilosopher by letting them lie dormant in his mind, nor by\\nsurrendering himself passively to them till he could°mechan-ically\\nmechanically apply them everywhere. He was a philosopher only in\\nvirtue of the active attitude which his mind took towards\\nthem. He could not simply accept them at their face-value;\\nhe must ask after the source of their value, the royal stamp\\nof meaning which made them a circulatory medium. That is\\nto say, he had to interpret these ideas, to see what they\\nmean, and what is the basis of their validity.\\nNot many men have been so conscious of just the\\nbearings of their own ideas and of their source as was he. He\\noften allows us a direct glimpse into the method of his\\nthinking, and nowhere more than when he says: \"Those\\nwho give themselves up to the details of science usually\\ndespise abstract and general researches. Those who go into\\nuniversal principles rarely care for particular facts. But I\\nequally esteem both.\" Leibniz, in other words, was equally\\ninterested in the application of scientific principles to the\\nexplanation of the details of natural phenomena, and in the\\nbearing and meaning of the principles themselves,—a rare\\ncombination, indeed, but one, which existing, stamps the\\ngenuine philosopher. Leibniz substantially repeats this idea\\nwhen he says: \"Particular effects must be explained°me-chanically\\nmechanically; but the general principles of physics and°mathe-matics\\nmathematics depend upon metaphysics.\" And again: \"All occurs\\nmechanically; but the mechanical principle is not to be°ex-plained\\nexplained from material and mathematical considerations, but\\nit flows from a higher and a metaphysical source.\"\\nAs a man of science, Leibniz might have stopped short\\nwith the ideas of mechanical law, of the application of°math-ematics\\n ― 279 ―\\n                            \\nmathematics, and of the continuity of development. As a°philoso-pher\\nphilosopher he could not. There are some scientific men to whom it\\nalways seems a perversion of their principles to attempt to\\ncarry them any beyond their application to the details of the\\nsubject. They look on in a bewildered and protesting°atti-tude\\nattitude when there is suggested the necessity of any further\\ninquiry. Or perhaps they dogmatically deny the possibility\\nof any such investigation, and as dogmatically assume the\\nsufficiency of their principles for the decision of all possible\\nproblems. But bewildered fear and dogmatic assertion are\\nequally impotent to fix arbitrary limits to human thought.\\nWherever there is a subject that has meaning, there is a\\nfield which appeals to mind, and the mind will not cease its\\nendeavors till it has made out what that meaning is, and has\\nmade it out in its entirety. So the three principles already\\nspoken of were but the starting-points, the stepping-stones\\nof Leibniz\\'s philosophic thought. While to physical science\\nthey are solutions, to philosophy they are problems; and as\\nsuch Leibniz recognized them. What solution did he give?\\nSo far as the principle of mechanical explanation is\\nconcerned, the clew is given by considering the factor upon\\nwhich he laid most emphasis, namely, motion. Descartes\\nhad said that the essence of the physical world is extension.\\n\"Not so,\" replied Leibniz; \"it is motion.\" These answers\\nmark two typical ways of regarding nature. According to\\none, nature is something essentially rigid and static;°what-ever\\nwhatever change in it occurs, is a change of form, of°arrange-ment\\narrangement, an external modification. According to the other,°na-ture\\nnature is something essentially dynamic and active. Change\\naccording to law is its very essence. Form, arrangement are\\nonly the results of this internal principle. And so to Leibniz,\\nextension and the spatial aspects of physical existence were\\nonly secondary, they were phenomenal. The primary, the\\nreal fact was motion.\\nThe considerations which led him to this conclusion\\nare simple enough. It is the fact already mentioned, that\\nexplanation always consists in reducing phenomena to a law\\nof motion which connects them. Descartes himself had not\\nsucceeded in writing his physics without everywhere using\\nthe conception of motion. But motion cannot be got out of\\n\\n ― 280 ―\\n                            \\nthe idea of extension. Geometry will not give us activity.\\nWhat is this, except virtually to admit the insufficiency of\\npurely statical conceptions? Leibniz found himself confirmed\\nin this position by the fact that the more logical of the\\nfollowers of Descartes had recognized that motion is a\\nsuperfluous intruder, if extension be indeed the essence of\\nmatter, and therefore had been obliged to have recourse to\\nthe immediate activity of God as the cause of all changes.\\nBut this, as Leibniz said, was simply to give up the very idea\\nof mechanical explanation, and to fall back into the purely\\ngeneral explanations of scholasticism.\\nThis is not the place for a detailed exposition of the\\nideas of Leibniz regarding matter, motion, and extension.\\nWe need here only recognize that he saw in motion the final\\nreality of the physical universe. But what about motion? To\\nmany, perhaps the majority, of minds to-day it seems useless\\nor absurd, or both, to ask any question about motion. It is\\nsimply an ultimate fact, to which all other facts are to be\\nreduced. We are so familiar with it as a solution of all\\nphysical problems that we are confused, and fail to°recog-nize\\nrecognize it when it appears in the guise of a problem. But, I\\nrepeat, philosophy cannot stop with facts, however ultimate.\\nIt must also know something about the meaning, the°signifi-cance\\nsignificance, in short the ideal bearing, of facts. From the point of\\nview of philosophy, motion has a certain function in the\\neconomy of the universe; it is, as Aristotle saw, something\\nideal.\\nThe name of Aristotle suggests the principles which\\nguided Leibniz in his interpretation of the fact of motion.\\nThe thought of Aristotle moves about the two poles of\\npotentiality and actuality. Potentiality is not mere capacity;\\nit is being in an undeveloped, imperfect stage. Actuality is,\\nas the word suggests, activity. Anything is potential in so\\nfar as it does not manifest itself in action; it is actual so far\\nas it does thus show forth its being. Now, movement, or\\nchange in its most general sense, is that by which the\\npotential comes to the realization of its nature, and functions\\nas an activity. Motion, then, is not an ultimate fact, but is\\nsubordinate. It exists for an end. It is that by which°exist-ence\\nexistence realizes its idea; that is, its proper type of action.\\n\\n ― 281 ―\\n                            \\nNow Leibniz does not formally build upon these°dis-tinctions\\ndistinctions; and yet he is not very far removed from Aristotle.\\nMotion, he is never weary of repeating, means force, means\\nenergy, means activity. To say that the essence of nature is\\nmotion, is to say that the natural world finally introduces us\\nto the supremacy of action. Reality is activity. Substance\\nc\\'est l\\'action. That is the key-note and the battle-cry of the\\nLeibnizian philosophy. Motion is that by which being°ex-presses\\nexpresses its nature, fulfils its purpose, reveals its idea. In\\nshort, the specific scientific conception of motion is by°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz transformed into the philosophic conception of force, of\\nactivity. In motion he sees evidence of the fact that the\\nuniverse is radically dynamic.\\nIn the applicability of mathematics to the°interpreta-tion\\ninterpretation of nature Leibniz finds witness to the continuity and\\norder of the world. We have become so accustomed to the\\nfact that mathematics may be directly employed for the\\ndiscussion and formulation of physical investigations that\\nwe forget what is implied in it. It involves the huge°assump-tion\\nassumption that the world answers to reason; so that whatever the\\nmind finds to be ideally true may be taken for granted to be\\nphysically true also. But in those days, when the correlation\\nof the laws of the world and the laws of mathematical\\nreasoning was a fresh discovery, this aspect of the case could\\nnot be easily lost sight of.\\nIn fact it was this correlation which filled the Zeitgeist\\nof the sixteenth century with the idea that it had a new\\norgan for the penetration of nature, a new sense for learning\\nits meaning. Descartes gives the following as the origin of\\nhis philosophy: \"The long chains of simple and easy reasons\\nwhich geometers employ, even in their most complex°dem-onstrations\\ndemonstrations, made me fancy that all things which are the\\nobjects of human knowledge are similarly interdependent.\"\\nTo Leibniz also mathematics seemed to give a clew to the\\norder, the interdependence, the harmonious relations, of the\\nworld.\\nIn this respect the feeling of Plato that God°geome-trizes\\ngeometrizes found an echoing response in Leibniz. But the latter\\nwould hardly have expressed it in the same way. He would\\nhave preferred to say that God everywhere uses the°infinites-imal\\n ― 282 ―\\n                            \\ninfinitesimal calculus. In the applicability of the calculus to the\\ndiscussion of physical facts, Leibniz saw two truths reflected,\\n—that everything that occurs has its reason, its dependent\\nconnection upon something else, and that all is continuous\\nand without breaks. While the formal principles of his logic\\nare those of identity and contradiction, his real principles are\\nthose of sufficient reason and of continuity. Nature never\\nmakes leaps; everything in nature has a sufficient reason\\nwhy it is as it is: these are the philosophic generalizations\\nwhich Leibniz finds hidden in the applicability of°mathemat-ics\\nmathematics to physical science. Reason finds itself everywhere°ex-pressed\\nexpressed in nature; and the law of reason is unity in diversity,\\ncontinuity.\\nLet us say, in a word, that the correlation between the\\nlaws of mathematics and of physics is the evidence of the\\nrational character of nature. Nature may be reduced to\\nmotions; and motions can be understood only as force,°activ-ity\\nactivity. But the laws which connect motions are fundamentally\\nmathematical laws,—laws of reason. Hence force, activity,\\ncan be understood only as rational, as spiritual. Nature is\\nthus seen to mean Activity, and Activity is seen to mean\\nIntelligence. Furthermore, as the fundamental law of°intel-ligence\\nintelligence is the production of difference in unity, the primary\\nlaw of physical change must be the manifestation of this\\nunity in difference,—or, as Leibniz interpreted it, continuity.\\nIn nature there are no breaks, neither of quantity nor of\\nquality nor of relationship. The full force of this law we\\nshall see later.\\nSuch an idea can hardly be distinguished from the idea\\nof growth or development; one passes naturally into the\\nother. Thus it is equally proper to say that the third°scien-tific\\nscientific influence, the conception of organism and growth, is\\ndominant in the Leibnizian thought, or that this is°swal-lowed\\nswallowed up and absorbed in the grand idea of continuity. The\\nlaw of animal and vegetable life and the law of the universe\\nare identified. The substance of the universe is activity; the\\nlaw of the universe is interdependence. What is this but to\\nsay that the universe is an organic whole? Its activity is the\\nmanifestation of Life,—nay, it is Life. The laws of its°activ-ity\\nactivity reveal that continuity of development, that harmony of\\n\\n ― 283 ―\\n                            \\ninter-relation, which are everywhere the marks of life. The\\nfinal and fundamental notion, therefore, by which Leibniz\\ninterprets the laws of physics and mathematics is that of\\nLife. This is his regnant category. It is \"that higher and\\nmetaphysical source\" from which the very existence and\\nprinciples of mechanism flow. The perpetual and ubiquitous\\npresence of motion reveals the pulsations of Life; the°corre-lation\\ncorrelation, the rationality, of these motions indicate the guiding\\npresence of Life. This idea is the alpha and omega of his\\nphilosophy.\\n\\n ― 284 ―\\n                            \\n3: The Problem, and Its SolutionLeibniz, like every great man, absorbed into himself the\\nvarious thoughts of his time, and in absorbing transformed\\nthem. He brought into a focus of brilliancy the diffused\\nlights of truth shining here and there. He summed up in a\\npregnant and comprehensive category the scattered°princi-ples\\nprinciples of his age. Yet we are not to suppose that Leibniz\\nconsidered these various ideas one by one, and then patched\\nthem into an artificial unity of thought. Philosophies are not\\nmanufactured piecemeal out of isolated and fragmentary\\nthoughts; they grow from a single root, absorbing from their\\nenvironment whatever of sustenance offers itself, and°matur-ing\\nmaturing in one splendid fruit of spiritual truth. It is convenient,\\nindeed, to isolate various phases of truth, and consider them\\nas distinct forces working to shape one final product, and as\\na convenient artifice it is legitimate. But it answers to no\\nprocess actually occurring. Leibniz never surrendered his\\npersonal unity, and out of some one root-conception grew all\\nhis ideas. The principles of his times were not separate\\nforces acting upon him, they were the foods of which he\\nselected and assimilated such as were fitted to nourish his\\none great conception.\\nBut it is more than a personal unity which holds°to-gether\\ntogether the thinking of a philosopher. There is the unity of\\nthe problem, which the philosopher has always before him,\\nand in which all particular ideas find their unity. All else\\nissues from this and merges into it. The various influences\\nwhich we have seen affecting Leibniz, therefore, got their\\neffectiveness from the relation which he saw them bear to\\nthe final problem of all thought. This is the inquiry after the\\nunity of experience, if we look at it from the side of the\\n\\n ― 285 ―\\n                            \\nsubject; the unity of reality, if we put it from the objective\\nside. Yet each age states this problem in its own way,\\nbecause it sees it in the light of some difficulty which has\\nrecently arisen in consciousness. At one time, the question is\\nas to the relation of the one to the many; at another, of the\\nrelation of the sensible to the intelligible world; at another,\\nof the relation of the individual to the universal. And this\\nlast seems to have been the way in which it specifically\\npresented itself to Leibniz. This way of stating it was°devel-oped\\ndeveloped, though apparently without adequate realization of its\\nmeaning, by the philosophy of scholasticism. It stated the\\nproblem as primarily a logical question,—the relation of\\ngenera, of species, of individuals to each other. And the\\nschool-boy, made after the stamp of literary tradition, knows\\nthat there were two parties among the Schoolmen,—the\\nRealists, and the Nominalists; one asserting, the other°deny-ing\\ndenying, the objective reality of universals. To regard this°dis-cussion\\ndiscussion as useless, is to utter the condemnation of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, and to relegate the foundation of science to the realm of\\nthings not to be inquired into. To say that it is an easy\\nmatter to decide, is to assume the decision with equal ease of\\nall the problems that have vexed the thought of humanity.\\nTo us it seems easy because we have bodily incorporated\\ninto our thinking the results of both the realistic and the\\nnominalistic doctrines, without attempting to reconcile\\nthem, or even being conscious of the necessity of°reconcilia-tion\\nreconciliation. We assert in one breath that the individual is alone\\nreal, and in the next assert that only those forms of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness which represent something in the universe are to\\nbe termed knowledge. At one moment we say that universals\\nare creations of the individual mind, and at the next pass on\\nto talk of laws of nature, or even of a reign of law. In other\\nwords, we have learned to regard both the individual and the\\nuniversal as real, and thus ignoring the problem, think we\\nhave solved it.\\nBut to Leibniz the problem presented itself neither as a\\nlogical question, nor yet as one whose solution might be\\ntaken for granted. On the contrary, it was just this question:\\nHow shall we conceive the individual to be related to the\\nuniverse? which seemed to him to be the nerve of the°philo-sophic\\n ― 286 ―\\n                            \\nphilosophic problem, the question whose right answer would\\nsolve the problems of religion, of morals, of the basis of\\nscience, as well as of the nature of reality. The importance\\nof just this way of putting the question had been rendered\\nevident by the predecessors and contemporaries of Leibniz,\\nespecially by Descartes, Spinoza, and Locke. His more°spe-cific\\nspecific relations to the last-named will occupy us hereafter; at\\npresent we must notice how the question stood at the hands\\nof Descartes and Spinoza.\\nDescartes had separated the individual from the°uni-versal\\nuniversal. His philosophy began and ended with a dualism. I\\nhave just said that the problem of philosophy is the unity of\\nexperience. Yet we find that there have been thinkers, and\\nthose of the first rank, who have left the matter without\\ndiscovering any ultimate unity, or rather who have made it\\nthe burden of their contention that we cannot explain the\\nworld without at least two disparate principles. But if we\\ncontinue to look at the matter in this historical way, we shall\\nsee that this dualism has always been treated by the°succes-sors\\nsuccessors of such a philosopher, not as a solution, but as a deeper\\nstatement of the problem. It is the function of dualistic\\nphilosophies to re-state the question in a new and more\\nsignificant way. There are times when the accepted unity of\\nthought is seen to be inadequate and superficial. Men are\\nthrashing old straw, and paying themselves with ideas\\nwhich have lost their freshness and their timeliness. There\\nthen arises a philosopher who goes deep, beyond the°superfi-cial\\nsuperficial unity, and who discovers the untouched problem. His it\\nis to assert the true meaning of the question, which has been\\nunseen or evaded. The attitude of dualism is thus always\\nnecessary, but never final. Its value is not in any solution,\\nbut in the generality and depth of the problem which it\\nproposes, and which incites thought to the discovery of a\\nunity of equal depth and comprehensiveness.\\nExcept for Descartes, then, we should not be conscious\\nof the gulf that yawns between the individual mind and the\\nuniverse in front of it. He presented the opposition as°be-tween\\nbetween mind and matter. The essence of the former is\\nthought; of the latter, extension. The conceptions are°dispa-rate\\ndisparate and opposed. No interaction is possible. His disciples,\\n\\n ― 287 ―\\n                            \\nmore consistent than their master, called in a Deus ex°ma-china\\nmachina,—the miraculous intervention of God,—in order to°ac-count\\naccount for the appearance of reciprocal action between the\\nuniverse of matter and the thinking individual. Thus they in\\nsubstance admitted the relation between them to be°scientifi-cally\\nscientifically inexplicable, and had recourse to the supernatural. The\\nindividual does not act upon the universe to produce,°de-stroy\\ndestroy, or alter the arrangement of anything. But upon the\\noccasion of his volition God produces a corresponding°mate-rial\\nmaterial change. The world does not act upon the soul of the\\nindividual to produce thoughts or sensations. God, upon\\noccasion of the external affection, brings them into being.\\nWith such thoroughness Descartes performed his task of\\nseparation. Yet the introduction of the Deus ex machina only\\ncomplicated the problem; it introduced a third factor where\\ntwo were already too many. What is the relation of God to\\nMind and to Matter? Is it simply a third somewhat, equally\\ndistinct from both, or does it contain both within itself?\\nSpinoza attempted to solve the problem in the latter\\nsense. He conceived God to be the one substance of the\\nuniverse, possessing the two known attributes of thought\\nand matter. These attributes are one in God; indeed, he is\\ntheir unity. This is the sole legitimate outcome of the°Carte-sian\\nCartesian problem stated as Descartes would have it stated. It\\novercomes the absoluteness of the dualism by discovering a\\ncommon and fundamental unity, and at the same time takes\\nthe subject out of the realm of the miraculous. For the\\nsolution works both ways. It affects the nature of God, as\\nwell as of extension and thought. It presents him to us, not\\nas a supernatural being, but as the unity of thought and\\nextension. In knowing these as they are, we know God as he\\nis. Spinoza, in other words, uses the conception of God in a\\ndifferent way from the Cartesians. The latter had treated\\nhim as the God of theology,—a being supernatural; Spinoza\\nuses the conception as a scientific one, and speaks of Deus\\nsive Natura.\\nLeibniz recognized the unphilosophic character of the\\nrecourse to a Deus ex machina as clearly as Spinoza, and yet\\ndid not accept his solution. To find out why he did not is the\\nproblem of the historian of thought. The one cause which\\n\\n ― 288 ―\\n                            \\nstands out above all others is that in the unity of Spinoza all\\ndifference, all distinction, is lost. All particular existences,\\nwhether things or persons, are modes of extension and\\nthought. Their apparent existence is due to the imagination,\\nwhich is the source of belief in particular things. When\\nconsidered as they really are,—that is, by the understanding,\\n—they vanish. The one substance, with its two unchanging\\nattributes of thought and extension, alone remains. If it is a\\nphilosophic error to give a solution which permits of no\\nunity, is it not equally a philosophic error to give one which\\ndenies difference? So it seemed to Leibniz. The problem is to\\nreconcile difference in unity, not to swallow up difference in\\na blank oneness,—to reconcile the individual with the°uni-verse\\nuniverse, not to absorb him.\\nThe unsatisfactoriness of the solution appears if we\\nlook at it from another side. Difference implies change, while\\na unity in which all variety is lost implies quiescence. Change\\nis as much an illusion of imagination to Spinoza as is°vari-ety\\nvariety. The One Reality is permanent. How repugnant the\\nconception of a static universe was to Leibniz we have\\nalready learned. Spinoza fails to satisfy Leibniz, therefore,\\nbecause he does not allow the conceptions of individuality\\nand of activity. He presents a unity in which all distinction\\nof individuals is lost, and in which there is no room for\\nchange. But Spinoza certainly presented the problem more\\nclearly to Leibniz, and revealed more definitely the°condi-tions\\nconditions of its solution. The search is henceforth for a unity\\nwhich shall avoid the irresolvable dualism of Descartes, and\\nyet shall allow free play to the principles of individuality and\\nof activity. There must be, in short, a universe to which the\\nindividual bears a real yet independent relation. What is this\\nunity? The answer, in the phraseology of Leibniz, is the\\nmonad. Spinoza would be right, said Leibniz, were it not for\\nthe existence of monads. I know there are some who have\\ndone Leibniz the honor of supposing that this is his way of\\nsaying, \"Spinoza is wrong because I am right\"; but I cannot\\nhelp thinking that the saying has a somewhat deeper°mean-ing\\nmeaning. What, then, is the nature of the monad? The answer to\\nthis question takes us back to the point where the discussion\\nof the question was left at the end of chapter second. The\\n\\n ― 289 ―\\n                            \\nnature of the monad is life. The monad is the spiritual\\nactivity which lives in absolute harmony with an infinite\\nnumber of other monads.\\nLet us first consider the reasons of Leibniz for°conceiv-ing\\nconceiving the principle of unity as spiritual. Primarily it is because\\nit is impossible to conceive of a unity which is material. In\\nthe sensible world there is no unity. There are, indeed,\\naggregations, collections, which seem like unities; but the\\nvery fact that these are aggregations shows that the unity is\\nfactitious. It is the very nature of matter to be infinitely\\ndivisible: to say this is to deny the existence of any true\\nprinciple of unity. The world of nature is the world of space\\nand time; and where in space or time shall we find a unity\\nwhere we may rest? Every point in space, every moment in\\ntime, points beyond itself. It refers to a totality of which it is\\nbut a part, or, rather, a limitation. If we add resistance, we\\nare not better situated. We have to think of something\\nwhich resists; and to this something we must attribute°exten-sion\\nextension,—that is to say, difference, plurality. Nor can we find\\nany resistance which is absolute and final. There may be a\\nbody which is undivided, and which resists all energy now\\nacting upon it; but we cannot frame an intelligible idea of a\\nbody which is absolutely indivisible. To do so is to think of a\\nbody out of all relation to existing forces, something°abso-lutely\\nabsolutely isolated; while the forces of nature are always relative\\nto one another. That which resists does so in comparison\\nwith some opposing energy. The absolutely indivisible, on\\nthe other hand, would be that which could not be brought\\ninto comparison with other forces; it would not have any of\\nthe attributes of force as we know it. In a word, whatever\\nexists in nature is relative in space, in time, and in qualities\\nto all else. It is made what it is by virtue of the totality of its\\nrelations to the universe; it has no ultimate principle of\\nself-subsistent unity in it.\\nNor do we fare better if we attempt to find unity in the\\nworld of nature as a whole. Nature has its existence as a\\nwhole in space and time. Indeed, it is only a way of°express-ing\\nexpressing the totality of phenomena of space and time. It is a mere\\naggregate, a collection. Its very essence is plurality,°differ-ence\\ndifference. It is divisible without limit, and each of its divisions\\n\\n ― 290 ―\\n                            \\nhas as good a right to be called one as the whole from which\\nit is broken off. We shall consider hereafter Leibniz\\'s idea of\\ninfinity; but it is easy to see that he must deny any true\\ninfinity to nature. An ultimate whole made up of parts is a\\ncontradictory conception; and the idea of a quantitative°infi-nite\\ninfinite is equally so. Quantity means number, measure,°limita-tion\\nlimitation. We may not be able to assign number to the totality of\\noccurrences in nature, nor to measure her every event. This\\nshows that nature is indefinitely greater than any assignable\\nquantity; but it does not remove her from the category of\\nquantity. As long as the world is conceived as that existing\\nin space and time, it is conceived as that which has to be\\nmeasured. As we saw in the last chapter, the heart of the\\nmechanical theory of the world is in the application of°math-ematics\\nmathematics to it. Since quantity and mathematics are correlative\\nterms, the natural world cannot be conceived as infinite or as\\nan ultimate unity.\\nIn short, Leibniz urges and suggests in one form and\\nanother those objections to the mechanical theory of reality\\nwhich later German philosophers have made us so familiar\\nwith. The objections are indeed varied in statement, but\\nthey all come to the impossibility of finding any unity, any\\nwholeness, anything except plurality and partiality in that\\nwhich is externally conditioned,—as everything is in nature.\\nBut the reasons as thus stated are rather negative than\\npositive. They show why the ultimate unity cannot be°con-ceived\\nconceived as material, rather than why it must be conceived as\\nspiritual. The immediate evidence of its spiritual nature\\nLeibniz finds in the perception of the one unity directly\\nknown to us,—the \"me,\" the conscious principle within,\\nwhich reveals itself as an active force, and as truly one, since\\nnot a spatial or temporal existence. And this evidence he\\nfinds confirmed by the fact that whatever unity material\\nphenomena appear to have comes to them through their\\nperception by the soul. Whatever the mind grasps in one\\nact, is manifested as one.\\nBut it is not in any immediate certainty of fact that\\nLeibniz finds the best or completest demonstration of the\\nspiritual nature of the ultimate unity. This is found in the\\nuse which can be made of the hypothesis. The truest witness\\n\\n ― 291 ―\\n                            \\nto the spiritual character of reality is found in the capacity of\\nthis principle to comprehend and explain the facts of°experi-ence\\nexperience. With this conception the reason of things can be\\nascertained, and light introduced into what were otherwise a\\nconfused obscurity. And, indeed, this is the only sufficient\\nproof of any doctrine. It is not what comes before the°for-mulation\\nformulation of a theory which proves it; it is not the facts which\\nsuggest it, or the processes which lead up to it: it is what\\ncomes after the formation of the theory,—the uses that it can\\nbe put to; the facts which it will render significant. The\\nwhole philosophy of Leibniz in its simplicity, width, and\\ndepth, is the real evidence of the truth of his philosophical\\nprinciple.\\nThe monad, then, is a spiritual unity; it is°individual-ized\\nindividualized life. Unity, activity, individuality, are synonymous\\nterms in the vocabulary of Leibniz. Every unity is a true\\nsubstance, containing within itself the source and law of its\\nown activity. It is that which is internally determined to\\naction. It is to be conceived after the analogy of the soul. It\\nis an indivisible unity, like \"that particular something in us\\nwhich thinks, apperceives and wills, and distinguishes us in\\na way of its own from whatever else thinks and wills.\"\\nAgainst Descartes, therefore, Leibniz stands for the°princi-ple\\nprinciple of unity; against Spinoza, he upholds the doctrine of\\nindividuality, of diversity, of multiplicity. And the latter\\nprinciple is as important in his thought as the former.°In-deed\\nIndeed, they are inseparable. The individual is the true unity.\\nThere is an infinite number of these individuals, each°dis-tinct\\ndistinct from every other. The law of specification, of°distinc-tion\\ndistinction, runs through the universe. Two beings cannot be alike.\\nThey are not individualized merely by their different°posi-tions\\npositions in space or time; duration and extension, on the°con-trary\\ncontrary, are, as we have seen, principles of relativity, of\\nconnection. Monads are specified by an internal principle.\\nTheir distinct individuality is constituted by their distinct\\nlaw of activity. Leibniz will not have a philosophy of°ab-stract\\nabstract unity, representing the universe as simple only, he\\nwill have a philosophy equal to the diversity, the manifold\\nwealth of variety, in the universe. This is only to say that he\\nwill be faithful to his fundamental notion,—that of Life. Life\\n\\n ― 292 ―\\n                            \\ndoes not mean a simple unity like a mathematical one, it\\nmeans a unity which is the harmony of the interplay of°di-verse\\ndiverse organs, each following its own law and having its\\nown function. When Leibniz says, God willed to have more\\nmonads rather than fewer, the expression is indeed one of na-\\nïveté, but the thought is one of unexplored depth. It is the\\nthought that Leibniz repeats when he says, \"Those who\\nwould reduce all things to modifications of one universal\\nsubstance do not have sufficient regard to the order, the°har-mony\\nharmony of reality.\" Leibniz applies here, as everywhere, the\\nprinciple of continuity, which is unity in and through°diver-sity\\ndiversity, not the principle of bare oneness. There is a kingdom of\\nmonads, a realm truly infinite, composed of individual°uni-ties\\nunities or activities in an absolute continuity. Leibniz was one\\nof the first, if not the first, to use just the expression°\"uni-formity\\n\"uniformity of nature\"; but even here he explains that it means\\n\"uniform in variety, one in principle, but varied in°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation.\" The world is to be as rich as possible. This is simply\\nto say that distinct individuality as well as ultimate unity is\\na law of reality.\\nBut has not Leibniz fallen into a perilous position? In\\navoiding the monotone of unity which characterizes the\\nthought of Spinoza, has he not fallen into a lawless variety of\\nmultiplicity, infinitely less philosophic than even the dualism\\nof Descartes, since it has an infinity of ultimate principles\\ninstead of only two? If Spinoza sacrificed the individual to\\nthe universe, has not Leibniz, in his desire to emphasize the\\nindividual, gone to the other extreme? Apparently we are\\nintroduced to a universe that is a mere aggregate of an\\ninfinite multiplicity of realities, each independent of every\\nother. Such a universe would not be a universe. It would be\\na chaos of disorder and conflict. We come, therefore, to a\\nconsideration of the relation between these individual°mo-nads\\nmonads and the universe. We have to discover what lifts the\\nmonads out of their isolation and bestows upon them that\\nstamp of universality which makes it possible for them to\\nenter into the coherent structure of reality: in a word, what\\nis the universal content which the monad in its formal°indi-viduality\\nindividuality bears and manifests?\\nThe way in which the question has just been stated\\n\\n ― 293 ―\\n                            \\nsuggests the Leibnizian answer. The monad, indeed, in its\\nform is thoroughly individual, having its own unique mode\\nof activity; but its content, that which this activity°mani-fests\\nmanifests, is not peculiar to it as an individual, but is the°sub-stance\\nsubstance or law of the universe. It is the very nature of the\\nmonad to be representative. Its activity consists in picturing\\nor reproducing those relations which make up the world of\\nreality. In a conscious soul, the ability thus to represent the\\nworld is called \"perception,\" and thus Leibniz attributes\\nperception to all the monads. This is not to be understood as\\na conscious representation of reality to itself (for this the\\nterm \"apperception\" is reserved), but it signifies that the\\nvery essence of the monad is to produce states which are not\\nits own peculiar possessions, but which reflect the facts and\\nrelations of the universe. Leibniz never wearies in finding\\nnew ways to express this purely representative character of\\nthe monad. The monads are little souls; they are mirrors of\\nthe world; they are concentrations of the universe, each\\nexpressing it in its own way; borrowing a term from°scholas-ticism\\nscholasticism, they are \"substantial forms.\" They are substantial,\\nfor they are independent unities; they are forms, because the\\nterm \"form\" expresses, in Aristotelian phraseology, the type\\nor law of some class of phenomena. The monad is an°individ-ual\\nindividual, but its whole content, its objectivity or reality, is the\\nsummation of the universe which it represents. It is°individ-ual\\nindividual, but whatever marks it as actual is some reproduction of\\nthe world. His reconciliation of the principles of°individual-ity\\nindividuality and universality is contained in the following words:\\n\"Each monad contains within itself an order corresponding\\nto that of the universe,—indeed, the monads represent the\\nuniverse in an infinity of ways, all different, and all true,\\nthus multiplying the universe as many times as is possible,\\napproaching the divine as near as may be, and giving the\\nworld all the perfection of which it is capable.\" The monad\\nis individual, for it represents reality in its own way, from\\nits own point of view. It is universal, for its whole content is\\nthe order of the universe.\\nNew light is thus thrown upon the former statement\\nthat reality is activity, that the measure of a being is the\\naction which it puts forth. That statement is purely formal.\\n\\n ― 294 ―\\n                            \\nIt leaves the kind of activity and its law wholly°undeter-mined\\nundetermined. But this relation of \"representativeness\" which we\\nhave discovered gives definiteness. It is the law of the°mo-nad\\nmonad\\'s action to mirror, to reflect, the universe; its changes\\nfollow each other so as to bring about this reflection in the\\ncompletest degree possible. The monad is literally the many\\nin the one; it is the answer to the inquiry of Greek°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy. The many are not present by way of participation in\\nsome underlying essence, not yet as statically possessed by\\nthe one, as attributes are sometimes supposed to inhere in a\\nsubstratum. The \"many\" is the manifestation of the activity\\nof the \"one.\" The one and the many are related as form and\\ncontent in an organic unity, which is activity. The essence of\\na substance, says Leibniz, consists in that regular tendency\\nof action by which its phenomena follow one another in a\\ncertain order; and that order, as he repeatedly states, is the\\norder in which the universe itself is arranged.\\nThe activity of a monad may be advantageously°com-pared\\ncompared to that of a supposed atom, granting, for the sake of\\nthe illustration, that there is such a thing. Each is in a state\\nof change: the atom changes its place, the monad its°repre-sentation\\nrepresentation, and each in the simplest and most uniform way\\nthat its conditions permit. How, then, is there such a°similar-ity\\nsimilarity, such a monotony, in the change of an atom, and such\\nvariety and complexity in the change of a monad? It is\\nbecause the atom has merely parts, or external variety, while\\nthe monad has an internal variety. Multiplicity is°organi-cally\\norganically wrought into its very being. It has an essential relation\\nto all things in the universe; and to say that this relation is\\nessential, is to say that it is one which constitutes its very\\ncontent, its being. Hence the cause of the changes of the\\nmonad, of their variety and complexity, is one with the cause\\nof the richness, the profusion, the regulated variety of\\nchange in the universe itself. While we have employed a\\ncomparison with atoms, this very comparison may serve to\\nshow us the impossibility of atoms as they are generally\\ndefined by the physicist turned philosopher. Atoms have no\\ninternal and essential relation to the world; they have no\\ninternal connection with any one thing in the world: and\\nwhat is this but to say that they do not enter anywhere into\\n\\n ― 295 ―\\n                            \\nthe structure of the world? By their very conception they are\\nforever aliens, banished from any share or lot in the realm of\\nreality. The idea which Leibniz never lets go, the idea which\\nhe always accentuates, is, then, the idea of an individual\\nactivity which in its continual change manifests as its own\\ninternal content and reality that reality and those laws of\\nconnection which make up the world itself.\\nWe are thus introduced naturally to the conception\\nwhich plays so large a part in the Leibnizian philosophy,\\nthat of pre-established harmony. This term simply names\\nthe fact, which we see to be fundamental with Leibniz,—the\\nfact that, while the form of every monad is individuality, a\\nunique principle of action, its content is universal, the very\\nbeing and laws of the world. For we must now notice more\\nexplicitly what has been wrapped up in the idea all along.\\nThere is no direct influence of monads upon each other. One\\ncannot affect another causally. There is no actual interaction\\nof one upon another. Expressed in that figurative language\\nwhich was ever natural to Leibniz, the monads have no\\nwindows by which anything can get in or out. This follows,\\nof course, from the mutual independence and individuality\\nof the monads. They are a true democracy, in which each\\ncitizen has sovereignty. To admit external influences acting\\nupon them is to surrender their independence, to deny their\\nsovereignty. But we must remember the other half. This\\ndemocracy is not after the Platonic conception of democracy,\\nin which each does as it pleases, and in which there is\\nneither order nor law, but the extremest assertion of°individ-uality\\nindividuality. What each sovereign citizen of the realm of reality\\nexpresses is precisely law. Each is an embodiment in its own\\nway of the harmony, the order, of the whole kingdom. Each\\nis sovereign because it is dynamic law,—law which is no\\nlonger abstract, but has realized itself in life. Thus another\\nway of stating the doctrine of pre-established harmony is the\\nunity of freedom and necessity. Each monad is free because\\nit is individual, because it follows the law of its own activity\\nunhindered, unretarded, by others; it is self-determined. But\\nit is self-determined to show forth the order, the harmony, of\\nthe universe. There is nothing of caprice, of peculiarity, in\\nthe content of the monad. It shows forth order; it is°organ-ized\\n ― 296 ―\\n                            \\norganized by law; it reveals the necessary connections which°con-stitute\\nconstitute the universe. The pre-established harmony is the\\nunity of the individual and the universe; it is the organic\\noneness of freedom and necessity.\\nWe see still further what it means when we learn that\\nit is by this conception that Leibniz reconciles the°concep-tions\\nconceptions of physical and final causation. There is no principle\\ncloser to the thought of Leibniz than that of the equal\\npresence and efficiency everywhere of both physical and final\\ncauses. Every fact which occurs is susceptible of a°mechani-cal\\nmechanical and of a rational explanation. It is necessarily connected\\nwith preceding states, and it has a necessary end which it is\\nfulfilling. The complete meaning of this principle will meet\\nus hereafter; at present we must notice that it is one form of\\nthe doctrine of pre-established harmony. All things have an\\nend because they form parts of one system; everything that\\noccurs looks forward to something else and prepares the way\\nfor it, and yet it is itself mechanically conditioned by its\\nantecedents. This is only another way of saying that there is\\ncomplete harmony between all beings in the universe; so\\nthat each monad in fulfilling the law of its own existence\\ncontributes to the immanent significance of the universe.\\nThe monads are co-ordinated in such a way that they°ex-press\\nexpress a common idea. There is a plan common to all, in\\nwhich each has its own place. All are making towards one\\ngoal, expressing one purpose. The universe is an organism;\\nand Leibniz would have applied to it the words which\\nMilne-Edwards applied to the human organism, as I find\\nthem quoted by Lewes: \"In the organism everything seems\\nto be calculated with one determined result in view; and the\\nharmony of the parts does not result from the influence\\nwhich they exert upon one another, but from their°co-ordina-tion\\nco-ordination under the rule of a common force, a preconceived plan,\\na pre-existent force.\" That is to say, the universe is°teleolog-ical\\nteleological, both as a whole and in its parts; for there is a common\\nidea animating it and expressed by it; it is mechanical, for\\nthis idea is realized and manifested by the outworking of\\nforces.\\nIt ought to be evident even from this imperfect sketch\\nthat the Leibnizian theory of pre-established harmony is not\\n\\n ― 297 ―\\n                            \\nthat utterly artificial and grotesque doctrine which it is\\nsometimes represented to be. The phrase \"pre-established\\nharmony\" is, strictly speaking, tautologous. The term\\n\"pre-established\" is superfluous. It means \"existent.\" There\\nis no real harmony which is not existent or pre-established.\\nAn accidental harmony is a contradiction in terms. It means\\na chaotic cosmos, an unordered order, a lawless law, or\\nwhatever else is nonsensical.\\nHarmony, in short, means relation, means connection,\\nmeans subordination and co-ordination, means adjustment,\\nmeans a variety, which yet is one. The Leibnizian doctrine is\\nnot a factitious product of his imagination, nor is it a°me-chanical\\nmechanical scheme for reconciling a problem which has no\\nexistence outside of the bewildered brains of philosophers. It\\nis an expression of the fact that the universe is one of order,\\nof continuity, of unity; it is the accentuating of this doctrine\\nso that the very essence of reality is found in this ordered\\ncombination; it is the special application of this principle to\\nthe solution of many of the problems which \"the mind of\\nman is apt to run into,\"—the questions of the relation of the\\nindividual and the universal, of freedom and necessity, of\\nthe physical and material, of the teleological and°mechani-cal\\nmechanical. We may not be contented with the doctrine as he°pre-sents\\npresents it, we may think it to be rather a summary and highly\\nconcentrated statement of the problem than its solution, or\\nwe may object to details in the carrying out of the doctrine.\\nBut we cannot deny that it is a genuine attempt to meet a\\ngenuine problem, and that it contains some, if not all, of the\\nfactors required for its adequate solution. To Leibniz must\\nremain the glory of being the thinker to seize upon the\\nperfect unity and order of the universe as its essential°char-acteristic\\ncharacteristic, and of arranging his thoughts with a view to\\ndiscovering and expressing it.\\nWe have but to notice one point more, and our task is\\ndone so far as it serves to make plain the standpoint from\\nwhich Leibniz criticised Locke. There is, we have seen, the\\ngreatest possible continuity and complexity in the realm of\\nmonads. There is no break, quantitative nor qualitative. It\\nfollows that the human soul has no gulf set between it and\\nwhat we call nature. It is only the highest, that is to say the\\n\\n ― 298 ―\\n                            \\nmost active and the most representative, of all monads. It\\nstands, indeed, at the head of the scale, but not outside it.\\nFrom the monad which reveals its presence in that stone\\nwhich with blinded eyes we call dead, through that which\\nacts in the plant, in the animal, up to that of man, there is no\\nchasm, no interruption. Nay, man himself is but one link in\\nthe chain of spiritual beings which ends only in God. All\\nmonads are souls; the soul of man is a monad which°repre-sents\\nrepresents the universe more distinctly and adequately. The law\\nwhich is enfolded in the lower monads is developed in it and\\nforms a part of its conscious activity. The universe, which is\\nconfusedly mirrored by the perception of the lower monad,\\nis clearly brought out in the conscious apperception of man.\\nThe stone is representative of the whole world. An°all-know-ing\\nall-knowing intelligence might read in it relations to every other fact\\nin the world, might see exemplified the past history of the\\nworld, and prefigured the events to come. For the stone is\\nnot an isolated existence, it is an inter-organic member of a\\nsystem. Change the slightest fact in the world, and in some\\nway it is affected. The law of the universe is one of°com-pleted\\ncompleted reciprocity, and this law must be mirrored in every\\nexistence of the universe. Increase the activity, the°represen-tative\\nrepresentative power, until it becomes turned back, as it were, upon\\nitself, until the monad not only is a mirror, but knows itself\\nas one, and you have man. The soul of man is the world\\ncome to consciousness of itself. The realm of monads in\\nwhat we call the inorganic world and the lower organic\\nrealm shows us the monad let and hindered in its°develop-ment\\ndevelopment. These realms attempt to speak forth the law of their\\nbeing, and reveal the immanent presence of the universe; but\\nthey do not hear their own voice, their utterance is only for\\nothers. In man the universe is manifested, and is manifested\\nto man himself.\\n\\n ― 299 ―\\n                            \\n4: Locke and Leibniz — Innate IdeasThe reader, impatient of what may have seemed an over-\\nlong introduction, has perhaps been asking when he was to\\nbe brought to the subject under consideration,—the relations\\nof Leibniz to Locke. But it has been impossible to come to\\nthis question until we had formed for ourselves an outline of\\nthe philosophical position of Leibniz. Nowhere in the°Nou-veaux\\nNouveaux Essais does Leibniz give a connected and detailed\\nexposition of his philosophy, either as to his standpoint, his\\nfundamental principles, or his method.\\nSome preliminary view of his position is therefore a\\nnecessity. The demand for this preliminary exposition°be-comes\\nbecomes more urgent as we recognize that Leibniz\\'s remarks\\nupon Locke are not a critique of Locke from the standpoint\\nof the latter, but are the application of his own philosophical\\nconclusions. Criticism from within, an examination of a\\nsystem of thought with relation to the consistency and°coher-ency\\ncoherency of its results, the connection between these results and\\nthe method professedly employed, investigation which°de-pends\\ndepends not at all upon the position of the critic, but occupies\\nitself with the internal relations of the system under°discus-sion\\ndiscussion,—such criticism is a product of the present century.\\nWhat we find in the Nouveaux Essais is a comparison of the\\nideas of Locke with those of Leibniz himself, a testing of the\\nformer by the latter as a standard, their acceptance when\\nthey conform, their rejection when they are opposed, their\\ncompletion when they are in partial harmony.\\nThe value of this sort of criticism is likely to be small\\nand evanescent. If the system used as a standard is meagre\\nand narrow, if it is without comprehensiveness and°flexibil-ity\\nflexibility, it does not repay after-examination. The fact that the\\n\\n ― 300 ―\\n                            \\nNouveaux Essais of Leibniz have escaped the oblivion of the\\nphilosophical criticism of his day is proof, if proof still be\\nneeded, of the reasoned basis, the width of grasp, the°fertil-ity\\nfertility of suggestion which characterize the thought of Leibniz.\\nBut the fact that the criticism is, after all, external and not\\ninternal has made necessary the foregoing extended account\\nof his method and general results.\\nOn the other hand, what of Locke? How about him\\nwho is the recipient of the criticism? I assume that no\\nextended account of his ideas is here necessary, and conceive\\nmyself to be justified in this assumption by the fact that we\\nare already better acquainted with Locke. This°acquaint-ance\\nacquaintance, indeed, is not confined to those who have expressly\\nstudied Locke. His thought is an inheritance into which\\nevery English-speaking person at least is born. Only he who\\ndoes not think escapes this inheritance. Locke did the work\\nwhich he had to do so thoroughly that every Englishman\\nwho will philosophize must either build upon Locke\\'s°foun-dations\\nfoundations, or, with conscious purpose, clear the ground before\\nbuilding for himself. And it would be difficult to say that the\\nacceptance of Locke\\'s views would influence one\\'s thought\\nmore than their rejection. This must not, of course, be taken\\ntoo literally. It may be that one who is a lineal descendant\\nof Locke in the spiritual generations of thought would\\nnot state a single important truth as Locke stated it, or that\\nthose who seek their method and results elsewhere have not\\nrepudiated the thought of Locke as expressly belonging to\\nhim.\\nBut the fundamental principles of empiricism: its°con-ception\\nconception of intelligence as an individual possession; its idea of\\nreality as something over against and distinct from mind; its\\nexplanation of knowledge as a process of action and reaction\\nbetween these separate things; its account of our inability to\\nknow things as they really are,—these principles are°congen-ital\\ncongenital with our thinking. They are so natural that we either\\naccept them as axiomatic, and accuse those who reject them\\nof metaphysical subtlety, or, staggered perchance by some\\nof their results, give them up with an effort. But it is an\\neffort, and a severe one; and there is none of us who can tell\\nwhen some remnant of the conception of intelligence as\\n\\n ― 301 ―\\n                            \\npurely particular and finite will catch him tripping. On the\\nother hand, we realize much better than those who have\\nbehind them a Leibniz and a Kant, rather than a Locke and\\na Hume, the meaning and the thorough-going necessity of\\nthe universality of intelligence. Idealism must be in some\\nways arbitrary and superficial to him who has not had a\\npretty complete course of empiricism.\\nLeibniz seems to have been impressed with the Essay\\non the Human Understanding at its first appearance. As\\nearly as 1696 we find him writing a few pages of comment\\nupon the book. Compared with his later critique, these early\\n\"reflections\" seem colorless, and give the impression that\\nLeibniz desired to minimize his differences from Locke\\nrather than to set them forth in relief. Comparatively slight\\nas were his expressions of dissent, they appear to have stung\\nLocke when they reached him. Meantime Locke\\'s book was\\ntranslated into French, and made its way to a wider circle of\\nreaders. This seems to have suggested to Leibniz the°advisa-bility\\nadvisability of pursuing his comments somewhat further; and in\\nthe summer of 1703 he produced the work which now\\noccupies us. A letter which Leibniz wrote at about this time\\nis worth quoting at large for the light which it throws upon\\nthe man, as well as for suggesting the chief points in which\\nhe differed from Locke. Leibniz writes:—\\n\"I have forgotten to tell you that my comments upon\\nthe work of Locke are nearly done. As he has spoken in a\\nchapter of his second book about freedom, he has given me\\nan opportunity to discuss that; and I hope that I may have\\ndone it in such a way as will please you. Above all, I have\\nlaid it upon myself to save the immateriality of the soul,\\nwhich Locke leaves doubtful. I justify also the existence of\\ninnate ideas, and show that the soul produces their°percep-tion\\nperception out of itself. Axioms, too, I approve, while Locke has a\\nlow opinion of them. In contradiction to him, I show that the\\nindividuality of man, through which he preserves his°iden-tity\\nidentity, consists in the duration of the simple or immaterial\\nsubstance which animates him; that the soul is never°with-out\\nwithout representations; that there is neither a vacuum nor\\natoms; that matter, or the passive principle, cannot be°con-scious\\nconscious, excepting as God unites with it a conscious°sub-stance\\n ― 302 ―\\n                            \\nsubstance. We disagree, indeed, in numerous other points, for I\\nfind that he rates too low the noble philosophy of the°Pla-tonic\\nPlatonic school (as Descartes did in part), and substitutes\\nopinions which degrade us, and which may become hurtful\\nto morals, though I am persuaded that Locke\\'s intention was\\nthoroughly good. I have made these comments in leisure\\nhours, when I have been journeying or visiting, and could\\nnot occupy myself with investigations requiring great pains.\\nThe work has continued to grow under my hands, for in\\nalmost every chapter, and to a greater extent than I had\\nthought possible, I have found matter for remark. You will\\nbe astonished when I tell you that I have worked upon this\\nas upon something which requires no great pains. But the\\nfact is, that I long ago established the general principles of\\nphilosophic subjects in my mind in a demonstrative way, or\\npretty nearly so, and that they do not require much new\\nconsideration from me.\"\\nLeibniz goes on to add that he has put these reflections\\nin the form of a dialogue that they may be more attractive;\\nhas written them in the popular language, rather than in\\nLatin, that they may reach as wide a circle as the work of\\nLocke; and that he hopes to publish them soon, as Locke is\\nalready an old man, and he wishes to get them before the\\npublic while Locke may still reply.\\nBut unfortunately this last hope was destined to remain\\nunrealized. Before the work of revision was accomplished,\\nLocke died. Leibniz, in a letter written in 1714, alludes to his\\ncontroversy with Locke as follows: \"I do not like the\\nthought of publishing refutations of authors who are dead.\\nThese should appear during their life, and be communicated\\nto them.\" Then, referring to his earlier comments, he says:\\n\"A few remarks escaped me, I hardly know how, and were\\ntaken to England. Mr. Locke, having seen them, spoke of\\nthem slightingly in a letter to Molineux. I am not°aston-ished\\nastonished at it. We were somewhat too far apart in principle,\\nand that which I suggested seemed paradoxical to him.\"\\nLeibniz, according to his conviction here expressed, never\\npublished his Nouveaux Essais sur l\\'Entendement Humain.\\nSchaarschmidt remarks that another reason may have°re-strained\\nrestrained him, in that he did not wish to carry on too many\\ncontroversies at once with the English people. He had two\\n\\n ― 303 ―\\n                            \\non his hands then,—one with the Newtonians regarding the\\ninfinitesimal calculus; the other with Bishop Clarke°regard-ing\\nregarding the nature of God, of time and space, of freedom, and\\ncognate subjects. However, in 1765, almost fifty years after\\nthe death of Leibniz, his critique upon Locke finally°ap-peared\\nappeared.\\nIt is somewhat significant that one whose tendency was\\nconciliatory, who was eminently what the Germans delight\\nto call him, a \"mediator,\" attempting to unite the varied\\ntruths which he found scattered in opposed systems, should\\nhave had so much of his work called forth by controversy.\\nAside from the cases just mentioned, his other chief work,\\nthe Theodicy, is, in form, a reply to Bayle. Many of his\\nminor pieces are replies to criticism or are developments of\\nhis own thought with critical reference to Descartes,°Male-branche\\nMalebranche, and others. But Leibniz has a somewhat different\\nattitude towards his British and towards his Continental\\nopponents. With the latter he was always in sympathy,\\nwhile they in turn gave whatever he uttered a respectful\\nhearing. Their mutual critiques begin and end in°compli-ments\\ncompliments. But the Englishmen found the thought of Leibniz\\n\"paradoxical\" and forced. It seemed to them wildly°specula-tive\\nspeculative, and indeed arbitrary guess-work, without any special\\nreason for its production, and wholly unverifiable in its\\nresults. Such has been the fate of much of the best German\\nthought since that time in the land of the descendants of\\nNewton and Locke. But Leibniz, on the other hand, felt as if\\nhe were dealing, in philosophical matters at least, with°foe-men\\nfoemen hardly worthy of his steel. Locke, he says, had subtlety\\nand address, and a sort of superficial metaphysics; but he\\nwas ignorant of the method of mathematics,—that is to say,\\nfrom the standpoint of Leibniz, of the method of all science.\\nWe have already seen that he thought the examination of a\\nwork which had been the result of the continued labor of\\nLocke was a matter for the leisure hours of his courtly visits.\\nIndeed, he would undoubtedly have felt about it what he\\nactually expressed regarding his controversy with Clarke,—\\nthat he engaged in it\\n\\nLudus et jocus, quia in philosophia\\nOmnia percepi atque animo mecum ante peregi.\\n\\n ― 304 ―\\n                            \\nHe regarded the English as superficial and without grasp of\\nprinciples, as they thought him over-deep and°over-theoreti-cal\\nover-theoretical.\\nFrom this knowledge of the external circumstances of\\nthe work of Leibniz and its relation to Locke, it is necessary\\nthat we turn to its internal content, to the thought of Leibniz\\nas related to the ideas of Locke. The Essay on the Human\\nUnderstanding is, as the name implies, an account of the\\nnature of knowledge. Locke tells us that it originated in the\\nfact that often, when he had been engaged in discussions\\nwith his friends, they found themselves landed in insoluble\\ndifficulties. This occurred so frequently that it seemed°prob-able\\nprobable that they had been going at matters from the wrong\\nside, and that before they attempted to come to conclusions\\nabout questions, they ought to examine the capacity of°intel-ligence\\nintelligence, and see whether it is fitted to deal with such°ques-tions\\nquestions. Locke, in a word, is another evidence of that truth\\nwhich lies at the basis of all forms of philosophical thought,\\nhowever opposed they may be to one another,—the truth that\\nknowledge and reality are so organic to each other that to\\ncome to any conclusion about one, we must know something\\nabout the other. Reality equals objects known or knowable,\\nand knowledge equals reality dissolved in ideas,—reality\\nwhich has become translucent through its meaning.\\nLocke\\'s Essay is, then, an account of the origin,°na-ture\\nnature, extent, and limitations of human knowledge. Such is\\nits subject-matter. What is its method? Locke himself tells\\nus that he uses the \"plain historical method.\" We do not\\nhave to resort to the forcing of language to learn that this\\nword \"historical\" contains the key to his work. Every page\\nof the Essay is testimony to the fact that Locke always\\nproceeds by inquiring into the way and circumstances by\\nwhich knowledge of the subject under consideration came\\ninto existence and into the conditions by which it was°devel-oped\\ndeveloped. Origin means with Locke, not logical dependence, but\\ntemporal production; development means temporal°succes-sion\\nsuccession. In the language of our day, Locke\\'s Essay is an°at-tempt\\nattempt to settle ontological questions by a psychological\\nmethod. And as we have before noticed, Leibniz meets him,\\nnot by inquiry into the pertinence of the method or into the\\n\\n ― 305 ―\\n                            \\nvalidity of results so reached, but by the more direct way of\\nimpugning his psychology, by substituting another theory\\nof the nature of mind and of the way in which it works.\\nThe questions with which the discussion begins are as\\nto the existence of innate ideas, and as to whether the soul\\nalways thinks,—questions which upon their face will lead\\nthe experienced reader of to-day to heave a sigh in memory\\nof hours wasted in barren dispute, and which will create a\\ndesire to turn elsewhere for matter more solid and more\\nnutritive. But in this case, under the form which the°discus-sion\\ndiscussion takes at the hands of Leibniz, the question which awaits\\nanswer under the meagre and worn-out formula of \"innate\\nideas\" is the function of intelligence in experience.\\nLocke denies, and denies with great vigor, the°exist-ence\\nexistence of innate ideas. His motives in so doing are practical\\nand theoretical. He sees almost every old idea, every°heredi-tary\\nhereditary prejudice, every vested interest of thought, defended on\\nthe ground that it is an innate idea. Innate ideas were\\nsacred, and everything which could find no defence before\\nreason was an innate idea. Under such circumstances he\\ntakes as much interest in demolishing them as Bacon took in\\nthe destruction of the \"eidols.\" But this is but a small\\nportion of the object of Locke. He is a thorough-going\\nempiricist; and the doctrine of innate ideas appears to offer\\nthe greatest obstacle to the acceptance of the truth that all\\nthe furnishing of the intellect comes from experience.\\nLocke\\'s metaphors for the mind are that it is a blank tablet,\\nan empty closet, an unwritten book. The \"innate idea\" is\\nonly a sentence written by experience, but which, deified by\\na certain school of philosophers, has come to be regarded as\\neternally imprinted upon the soul.\\nSuch, indeed, is Locke\\'s understanding of the nature of\\ninnate ideas. He conceives of them as \"characters stamped,\\nas it were, upon the mind of man, which the soul has\\nreceived in its first being and brings into the world with it\";\\nor they are \"constant impressions which the souls of men\\nreceive in their first beings.\" They are \"truths imprinted\\nupon the soul.\" Having this conception of what is meant by\\n\"innate ideas,\" Locke sets himself with great vigor, and, it\\nmust be confessed, with equal success, to their annihilation.\\n\\n ― 306 ―\\n                            \\nHis argument is somewhat diffuse and scattered, but in\\nsubstance it is as follows: Whatever is in the mind, the\\nmind must be conscious of. \"To be in the mind and not to be\\nperceived, is all one as to say that anything is and is not in\\nthe mind.\" If there be anything in the mind which is innate,\\nit must be present to the consciousness of all, and, it would\\nseem, of all at all times, savages, infants, and idiots°in-cluded\\nincluded. And as it requires little philosophical penetration to\\nsee that savages do not ponder upon the principle that°what-ever\\nwhatever is, is; that infants do not dwell in their cradle upon the\\nthought of contradiction, or idiots ruminate upon that of\\nexcluded middle,—it ought to be evident that such truths\\ncannot be innate. Indeed, we must admit, with Locke, that\\nprobably few men ever come to the explicit consciousness of\\nsuch ideas, and that these few are such as direct their minds\\nto the matter with some pains. Locke\\'s argument may be\\nsummed up in his words: If these are not notions naturally\\nimprinted, how can they be innate? And if they are notions\\nnaturally imprinted, how can they be unknown?\\nBut since it may be said that these truths are in the\\nmind, but in such a way that it is only when they are\\nproposed that men assent to them, Locke goes on to clinch\\nhis argument. If this be true, it shows that the ideas are not\\ninnate; for the same thing is true of a large number of\\nscientific truths, those of mathematics and morals, as well as\\nof purely sensible facts, as that red is not blue, sweet is not\\nsour, etc.,—truths and facts which no one calls innate. Or if\\nit be said that they are in the mind implicitly or potentially,\\nLocke points out that this means either nothing at all, or else\\nthat the mind is capable of knowing them. If this is what is\\nmeant by innate ideas, then all ideas are innate; for certainly\\nit cannot be denied that the mind is capable of knowing all\\nthat it ever does know, or, as Locke ingenuously remarks,\\n\"nobody ever denied that the mind was capable of knowing\\nseveral truths.\"\\nIt is evident that the force of Locke\\'s contention\\nagainst innate ideas rests upon a certain theory regarding\\nthe nature of innate ideas and of the relations of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness to intelligence. Besides this, there runs through his\\nwhole polemic the assertion that, after all, innate ideas are\\n\\n ― 307 ―\\n                            \\nuseless, as experience, in the sense of impressions received\\nfrom without, and the formal action of intelligence upon\\nthem, is adequate to doing all they are supposed to do. It is\\nhardly too much to say that the nerve of Locke\\'s argument is\\nrather in this positive assertion than in the negations which\\nhe brings against this existence. Leibniz takes issue with\\nhim on each of these three points. He has another conception\\nof the very nature of innate ideas; he denies Locke\\'s opinions\\nabout consciousness; he brings forward an opposed theory\\nupon the relation of experience to reason. This last point we\\nshall take up in a chapter by itself, as its importance extends\\nfar beyond the mere question as to the existence of ideas\\nwhich may properly be called innate. The other two°ques-tions\\nquestions, as to the real character of innate ideas and the°rela-tion\\nrelation of an idea to consciousness, afford material to occupy\\nus for the present.\\nThe metaphor which Locke constantly uses is the clew\\nto his conception of innate ideas. They are characters\\nstamped or imprinted upon the mind, they exist in the mind.\\nThe mind would be just what it is, even if they had no\\nexistence. It would not have quite so much \"in\" it, but its\\nown nature would not be changed. Innate ideas he conceives\\nas bearing a purely external relation to mind. They are not\\norganic to it, nor necessary instruments through which it\\nexpresses itself; they are mechanically impressed upon it.\\nBut what the \"intellectual\" school had meant by innate\\nideas was precisely that the relation of ideas to intelligence\\nis not that of passive holding or containing on the side of\\nmind, and of impressions or stamps on the side of the ideas.\\nLocke reads the fundamental category of°empiricism-me-chanical\\nempiricism-mechanical relation, or external action—into the nature of°in-nate\\ninnate ideas, and hence easily infers their absurdity. But the\\nobject of the upholders of innate ideas had been precisely to\\ndeny that this category was applicable to the whole of°intel-ligence\\nintelligence. By an innate idea they meant an assertion of the\\ndynamic relation of intelligence and some of its ideas. They\\nmeant to assert that intelligence has a structure, which\\nnecessarily functions in certain ways. While Locke\\'s highest\\nconception of an innate idea was that it must be something\\nready-made, dwelling in the mind prior to experience,°Leib-niz\\n ― 308 ―\\n                            \\nLeibniz everywhere asserts that it is a connection and relation\\nwhich forms the logical prius and the psychological basis of\\nexperience. He finds no difficulty in admitting all there is of\\npositive truth in Locke\\'s doctrine; namely, that we are not\\nconscious of these innate ideas until a period later than that\\nin which we are conscious of sensible facts, or, in many\\ncases, are not conscious of them at all. This priority in time\\nof sensible experience to rational knowledge, however, can\\nbecome a reason for denying the \"innate\" character of the\\nlatter only when we suppose that they are two entirely\\ndifferent orders of fact, one knowledge due to experience,\\nthe other knowledge already formed and existing in the\\nmind prior to \"experience.\"\\nLeibniz\\'s conception of the matter is brought out when\\nhe says that it is indeed true that we begin with particular\\nexperiences rather than with general principles, but that the\\norder of nature is the reverse, for the ground, the basis of\\nthe particular truths is in the general; the former being in\\nreality only instances of the latter. General principles, he\\nsays, enter into all our thoughts, and form their soul and\\ninterconnection. They are as necessary for thought as°mus-cles\\nmuscles and tendons are for walking, although we may not be\\nconscious of their existence. This side of the teaching of\\nLeibniz consists, accordingly, in the assertion that \"innate\"\\nknowledge and knowledge derived from experience are not\\ntwo kinds of knowledge, but rather two ways of considering\\nit. If we consider it as it comes to us, piecemeal and°frag-mentary\\nfragmentary, a succession of particular instances, to be gathered\\nup at a future time into general principles, and stated in a\\nrational form, it is seen as empirical. But, after all, this is\\nonly a superficial and external way of looking at it. If we\\nexamine into it we shall see that there are contained in these\\ntransitory and particular experiences certain truths more\\ngeneral and fundamental, which condition them, and at the\\nsame time constitute their meaning.\\nIf we inquire into the propriety of calling these truths\\n\"innate,\" we find it is because they are native to°intelli-gence\\nintelligence, and are not acquisitions which it makes. Indeed, it\\nmay be said that they are intelligence, so close and organic is\\ntheir relation, just as the muscles, the tendons, the skeleton,\\n\\n ― 309 ―\\n                            \\nare the body. Thus it is that Leibniz accepts the statement,\\nNihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu, with the\\naddition of the statement nisi ipse intellectus. The doctrine\\nof the existence of innate ideas is thus shown to mean that\\nintelligence exists with a real content which counts for°some-thing\\nsomething in the realm of experience. If we take intelligence and\\nexamine into its structure and ascertain its modes of°expres-sion\\nexpression, we find organically inherent in its activity certain°con-ceptions\\nconceptions like unity, power, substance, identity, etc., and\\nthese we call \"innate.\" An idea, in short, is no longer\\nconceived as something existing in the mind or in°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness; it is an activity of intelligence. An innate idea is a\\nnecessary activity of intelligence; that is, such an activity\\nas enters into the framework of all experience.\\nLeibniz thus succeeds in avoiding two errors into\\nwhich philosophers whose general aims are much like his\\nhave fallen. One is dividing a priori and a posteriori truths\\nfrom each other by a hard and fixed line, so that we are\\nconceived to have some knowledge which comes wholly\\nfrom experience, while there is another which comes wholly\\nfrom reason. According to Leibniz, there is no thought so\\nabstract that it does not have its connection with a sensible\\nexperience, or rather its embodiment in it. And, on the other\\nhand, there is no experience so thoroughly sensuous that it\\ndoes not bear in itself traces of its origin in reason. \"All our\\nthoughts come from the depths of the soul,\" says Leibniz;\\nthere are none that \"come\" to us from without. The other\\nerror is the interpretation of the existence of innate ideas or\\n\"intuitions\" (as this school generally calls them) in a\\npurely formal sense. They are thus considered as truths\\ncontained in and somehow expressed by intelligence, but yet\\nnot so connected with it that in knowing them we necessarily\\nknow intelligence itself. They are considered rather as°arbi-trary\\narbitrary determinations of truths by a power whose own nature\\nis conceivably foreign to truth, than as so many special\\ndevelopments of an activity which may indifferently be\\ncalled \"intelligence\" or \"truth.\" Leibniz, however, never\\nfails to state that an innate truth is, after all, but one form or\\naspect of the activity of the mind in knowing.\\nIn this way, by bringing to light a deeper and richer\\n\\n ― 310 ―\\n                            \\nconception of what in reality constitutes an innate idea,\\nLeibniz answers Locke. His reply is indirect; it consists\\nrather in throwing a flood of new light upon the matter\\ndiscussed, than in a ponderous response and counter-attack.\\nBut when Leibniz touches upon the conception of a tabula\\nrasa, of a mind which in itself is a mere blank, but has the\\ncapacity for knowing, he assumes the offensive. The idea of\\na bare capacity, a formal faculty, of power which does not\\nalready involve some actual content within itself, he°repu-diates\\nrepudiates as a relic of scholasticism. What is the soul, which\\nhas nothing until it gets it from without? The doctrine of a\\nvacuum, an emptiness which is real, is always absurd; and it\\nis doubly so when to this vacuum ^are ascribed powers of\\nfeeling and thinking, as Locke does. Accepting for the°mo-ment\\nmoment the metaphor of a tabula rasa, Leibniz asks where we\\nshall find a tablet which yet does not have some quality, and\\nwhich is not a co-operating cause, at least, in whatever\\neffects are produced upon it? The notion of a soul without\\nthought, an empty tablet of the soul, he says, is one of a\\nthousand fictions of philosophers. He compares it with the\\nidea of \"space empty of matter, absolute uniformity or°homo-geneity\\nhomogeneity, perfect spheres of the second element produced by\\nprimordial perfect cubes, abstractions pure and simple, to\\nwhich our ignorance and inattention give birth, but of which\\nreality does not admit.\" If Locke admits then (as he does)\\ncertain capacities inherent in the soul, he cannot mean the\\nscholastic fiction of bare capacity or mere possibility; he\\nmust mean \"real possibilities,\"—that is, capacities°accompa-nied\\naccompanied with some actual tendency, an inclination, a disposition,\\nan aptitude, a preformation which determines our soul in a\\ncertain direction, and which makes it necessary that the\\npossibility becomes actual. And this tendency, this actual\\ninclination of intelligence in one way rather than another, so\\nthat it is not a matter of indifference to intelligence what it\\nproduces, is precisely what constitutes an innate idea. So\\nLeibniz feels certain that at bottom Locke must agree with\\nhim in this matter if the latter is really in earnest in°reject-ing\\nrejecting the \"faculties\" of the Scholastics and in wishing for a\\nreal explanation of knowledge.\\nBut the argument of Locke rests upon yet another\\n\\n ― 311 ―\\n                            \\nbasis. He founds his denial of innate ideas not only upon a\\nstatic conception of their ready-made existence \"in\" the\\nsoul, but also upon an equally mechanical conception of\\nconsciousness. \"Nothing can be in the mind which is not in\\nconsciousness.\" This statement appears axiomatic to Locke,\\nand by it he would settle the whole discussion. Regarding it,\\nLeibniz remarks that if Locke has such a prejudice as this, it\\nis not surprising that he rejects innate ideas. But°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness and mental activity are not thus identical. To go no\\nfarther, the mere empirical fact of memory is sufficient to\\nshow the falsity of such an idea. Memory reveals that we\\nhave an indefinite amount of knowledge of which we are not\\nalways conscious. Rather than that knowledge and°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness are one, it is true that actual consciousness only\\nlays hold of an infinitesimal fraction of knowledge. But\\nLeibniz does not rely upon the fact of memory alone. We\\nmust constantly keep in mind that to Leibniz the soul is not\\na form of being wholly separate from nature, but is the\\nculmination of the system of reality. The reality is°every-where\\neverywhere the monad, and the soul is the monad with the power\\nof feeling, remembering, and connecting its ideas. The°ac-tivities\\nactivities of the monad, those representative changes which\\nsum up and symbolize the universe, do not cease when we\\nreach the soul. They are continued. If the soul has the power\\nof attention, they are potentially conscious. Such as the soul\\nactually attends to, thus giving them relief and making them\\ndistinct, are actually conscious. But all of them exist.\\nThus it is that Leibniz not only denies the equivalence\\nof soul and consciousness, but asserts that the fundamental\\nerror of the psychology of the Cartesians (and here, at least,\\nLocke is a Cartesian) is in identifying them. He asserts that\\n\"unconscious ideas\" are of as great importance in°psychol-ogy\\npsychology as molecules are in physics. They are the link between\\nunconscious nature and the conscious soul. Nothing happens\\nall at once; nature never makes jumps; these facts stated in\\nthe law of continuity necessitate the existence of activities,\\nwhich may be called ideas, since they belong to the soul and\\nyet are not in consciousness.\\nWhen, therefore, Locke asks how an innate idea can\\nexist and the soul not be conscious of it, the answer is at\\n\\n ― 312 ―\\n                            \\nhand. The \"innate idea\" exists as an activity of the soul by\\nwhich it represents—that is, expresses-some relation of the\\nuniverse, although we have not yet become conscious of\\nwhat is contained or enveloped in this activity. To become\\nconscious of the innate idea is to lift it from the sphere of\\nnature to the conscious life of spirit. And thus it is, again,\\nthat Leibniz can assert that all ideas whatever proceed from\\nthe depths of the soul. It is because it is the very being of the\\nsoul as a monad to reflect \"from its point of view\" the world.\\nIn this way Leibniz brings the discussion regarding innate\\nideas out of the plane of examination into a matter of°psy-chological\\npsychological fact into a consideration of the essential nature of\\nspirit. An innate idea is now seen to be one of the relations\\nby which the soul reproduces some relation which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes the universe of reality, and at the same time realizes its\\nown individual nature. It is one reflection from that spiritual\\nmirror, the soul. With this enlarged and transformed°con-ception\\nconception of an idea apt to be so meagre we may well leave the\\ndiscussion. There has been one mind at least to which the\\nphrase \"innate ideas\" meant something worth contending\\nfor, because it meant something real.\\n\\n ― 313 ―\\n                            \\n5: Sensation and ExperienceA careful study of the various theories which have been held\\nconcerning sensation would be of as much interest and°im-portance\\nimportance as an investigation of any one point in the range of\\nphilosophy. In the theory of a philosopher about sensation\\nwe have the reflex of his fundamental category and the clew\\nto his further doctrine. Sensation stands on the border-line\\nbetween the world of nature and the realm of soul; and every\\nadvance in science, every development of philosophy, leaves\\nits impress in a change in the theory of sensation.°Appar-ently\\nApparently one of the simplest and most superficial of questions, in\\nreality it is one of the most difficult and far-reaching. At first\\nsight it seems as if it were a sufficient account of sensation to\\nsay that an object affects the organ of sense, and thus\\nimpresses upon the mind the quality which it possesses. But\\nthis simple statement arouses a throng of further questions:\\nHow is it possible that one substance,—matter,—should°af-fect\\naffect another,—mind? How can a causal relation exist°be-tween\\nbetween them? Is the mind passive or active in this°impres-sion\\nimpression? How can an object convey unchanged to the mind a\\nquality which it possesses? Or is the sensational quale itself\\na product of the mind\\'s activity? If so, what is the nature of\\nthe object which excites the sensation? As known, it is only a\\ncollection of sensuous qualities; if these are purely mental,\\nwhat becomes of the object? And if there is no object really\\nthere, what is it that excites the sensation? Such°question-ings\\nquestionings might be continued almost indefinitely; but those given\\nare enough to show that an examination of the nature and\\norigin of sensation introduces us to the problems of the\\nrelation of intelligence and the world; to the problem of the\\nultimate constitution of an object which is set over against a\\n\\n ― 314 ―\\n                            \\nsubject and which affects it; and to the problem of the nature\\nof mind, which as thus affected from without must be°lim-ited\\nlimited in its nature, but which as bearer of the whole known\\nuniverse must be in some sense infinite. If we consider, not\\nthe mode of production of sensation, but its relation to\\nknowledge, we find philosophical schools divided into two,\\n—Sensationalists, and Rationalists. If we inquire into its\\nfunctions, we find that the empiricist sees in it convincing\\nevidence of the fact that all knowledge originates from a\\nsource extra mentem; that the intellectual idealist finds in it\\nevidence of the gradual transition of nature into spirit; that\\nthe ethical idealist, like Kant and Fichte, sees in it the\\nmaterial of the phenomenal world, which is necessary in its\\nopposition to the rational sphere in order that there may\\noccur that conflict of pure law and sensuous impulse which\\nalone makes morality possible. We thus realize that as we\\nlook at the various aspects of sensation, we are taken into the\\ndiscussion of ontology, of the theory of knowledge and of\\nethics.\\nLocke virtually recognizes the extreme importance of\\nthe doctrine of sensation, and his second book might almost\\nbe entitled \"Concerning the Nature and Products of°Sensa-tion\\nSensation.\" On the other hand, one of the most characteristic and\\nvaluable portions of the reply of Leibniz is in his°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of a theory of sensation which is thoroughly new,\\nexcept as we seek for its germs in its thoughts of Plato and\\nAristotle. According to Locke, knowledge originates from\\ntwo sources,—sensation and reflection. Sensations are \"the\\nimpressions made on our senses by outward objects that are\\nextrinsic to the mind.\" When the mind \"comes to reflect on\\nits own operations about the ideas got by sensation, and\\nthereby stores itself with a new set of ideas,\" it gets ideas of\\nreflection.\\nIf we leave out of account for the present the ideas of\\nreflection, we find that the ideas which come through°sensa-tion\\nsensation have two main characteristics. First, in having°sensa-tions\\nsensations, the mind is passive; its part is purely receptive. The\\nobjects impress themselves upon the mind, they obtrude into\\nconsciousness, whether the mind will or not. There is a\\npurely external relation existing between sensation and the\\n\\n ― 315 ―\\n                            \\nunderstanding. The ideas are offered to the mind, and the\\nunderstanding cannot refuse to have them, cannot change\\nthem, blot them out, nor create them, any more than a\\nmirror can refuse, alter, or obliterate the images which\\nobjects produce in it. Sensation, in short, is a purely passive\\nhaving of ideas. Secondly, every sensation is simple. Locke\\nwould say of sensations what Hume said of all ideas,—every\\ndistinct sensation is a separate existence. Every sensation is\\n\"uncompounded, containing nothing but one uniform°ap-pearance\\nappearance, not being distinguishable into different ideas.\"\\nKnowledge is henceforth a process of compounding, of°re-peating\\nrepeating, comparing, and uniting sensation. Man\\'s°under-standing\\nunderstanding \"reaches no further than to compound and divide\\nthe materials that are made to his hand.\"\\nIt hardly need be said that Locke has great difficulty in\\nkeeping up this thoroughly atomic theory of mind. It is a\\ntheory which makes all relations external; they are, as Locke\\nafterwards says, \"superinduced\" upon the facts. It makes it\\nimpossible to account for any appearance of unity and\\nconnection among ideas, and Locke quietly, and without any\\nconsciousness of the contradiction involved, introduces°cer-tain\\ncertain inherent relations into the structure of the ideas when\\nhe comes to his constructive work. \"Existence and unity are\\ntwo ideas,\" he says, \"that are suggested to the°understand-ing\\nunderstanding by every object without, and every idea within.\"\\nAt other places he introduces the idea of quality of a\\nsubstance, effect of a cause, continued permanence or°iden-tity\\nidentity into a sensation, as necessary constituents of it; thus\\nmaking a sensation a unity of complex elements instead of\\nan isolated bare notion. How far he could have got on in his\\naccount of knowledge without this surreptitious qualifying\\nof a professedly simple existence, may be seen by asking\\nwhat would be the nature of a sensation which did not\\npossess existence and unity, and which was not conceived as\\nthe quality of a thing or as the effect of an external reality.\\nThis digression has been introduced at this point°be-cause\\nbecause the next character of a sensation which Locke°dis-cusses\\ndiscusses is its objective character,—its relation to the object\\nwhich produces it. To discourse of our ideas intelligibly, he\\nsays, it will be convenient to distinguish them as they are\\n\\n ― 316 ―\\n                            \\nideas in our minds and as they are modifications of matter in\\nthe bodies that cause them. In other words, he gives up all\\nthought of considering ideas as simply mental modifications,\\nand finds it necessary to take them in their relations to\\nobjects.\\nTaking them in this way, he finds that they are to be\\ndivided into two classes, of which one contains those ideas\\nthat are copies and resemblances of qualities in the objects,\\nideas \"which are really in the object, whether we take notice\\nof them or no,\"—in which case we have an idea of the thing\\nas it is in itself; while the other class contains those which\\nare in no way resemblances of the objects which produce\\nthem, \"having no more similitude than the idea of pain and\\nof a sword.\" The former are primary qualities, and are°so-lidity\\nsolidity, extension, figure, motion or rest, and number; while\\nthe secondary qualities are colors, smells, and tastes. The°for-mer\\nformer ideas are produced by impulse of the bodies themselves,\\nwhich simply effect a transference of their qualities over into\\nthe mind; while the secondary qualities are arbitrarily°an-nexed\\nannexed by the power of God to the objects which excite them.\\nIt will be noticed that there are two elements which\\nmake the sensation of Locke what it is. With reference to its\\nproduction, it is the effect which one substance, matter, has\\nupon another substance, mind, which is unlike it in nature,\\nand between which whatever relations exist, are thoroughly\\nincomprehensible, so that, indeed, their connections with\\neach other can be understood only by recourse to a tertium\\nquid, an omnipotent power which can arbitrarily produce\\nsuch collocations as please it. With reference to its function,\\nit is the isolated and \"simple\" (that is, non-relational)°ele-ment\\nelement out of which all actual forms of knowledge are made\\nby composition and re-arrangement.\\nLeibniz, without entering into explicit criticism of just\\nthese two points, develops his own theory with reference to\\nthem. To Leibniz, reality constitutes a system; that is, it is\\nof such a nature that its various portions have an essential\\nand not merely external relation to one another. Sensation is\\nof course no exception. It is not a mere accident, nor yet a\\nsupernatural yoking of things naturally opposed. It has a\\nmeaning in that connection of things which constitute the\\n\\n ― 317 ―\\n                            \\nuniverse. It contributes to the significance of the world. It is\\none way in which those activities which make the real°ex-press\\nexpress themselves. It has its place or reason in the totality of\\nthings, and this whether we consider its origin or its position\\nwith regard to knowledge. In a word, while the°characteris-tic\\ncharacteristic of Locke\\'s theory is that he conceives sensation as in\\nexternal relation both to reality, as mechanically produced\\nby it, and to knowledge, as being merely one of the atomic\\nelements which may enter into a compound, Leibniz regards\\nreality as organic to sensation, and this in turn as organic to\\nknowledge. We have here simply an illustration of the°state-ment\\nstatement with which we set out; namely, that the treatment of\\nsensation always reflects the fundamental philosophical°cate-gory\\ncategory of the philosopher.\\nAll reality exists in the form of monads; monads are\\nsimple substances whose nature is action; this action consists\\nin representing, according to a certain law of succession, the\\nuniverse. Various monads have various degrees of activity;\\nthat is, of the power of reflecting the world. So much of\\nLeibniz\\'s general philosophical attitude it is necessary to\\nrecall, to understand what he means by \"sensation.\" The\\ngeneric name which is applied to this mirroring activity of\\nthe monads is \"perception,\" which, as Leibniz often says, is\\nto be carefully distinguished from apperception, which is the\\nrepresentation become conscious. Perception may be°de-fined\\ndefined, therefore, as the inclusion of the many or multiform\\n(the world of objects) in a unity (the simple substance). It\\nwas the great defect of previous philosophy that it°\"consid-ered\\n\"considered only spirits or self-conscious beings as souls,\" and had\\nconsequently recognized only conscious perceptions. It had\\nbeen obliged, therefore, to make an impassable gulf between\\nmind and matter, and sensations were thus rendered°inex-plicable\\ninexplicable. But Leibniz finds his function as a philosopher in\\nshowing that these problems, which seem insoluble, arise\\nwhen we insist upon erecting into actual separations or\\ndifferences of kind what really are only stages of°develop-ment\\ndevelopment or differences of degree. A sensation is not an effect\\nwhich one substance impresses upon another because God\\npleased that it should, or because of an incomprehensible\\nincident in the original constitution of things. It is a higher\\n\\n ― 318 ―\\n                            \\ndevelopment of that representative power which belongs to\\nevery real being.\\nCertain monads reach a state of development, or°mani-festation\\nmanifestation of activity, which is characterized by the possession\\nof distinct organs. Such monads may be called, in a°pre-emi-nent\\npre-eminent sense, \"souls,\" and include all the higher animals as\\nwell as man. This possession of differentiated organs finds\\nits analogue in the internal condition of the monad. What\\nappears externally as an organ of sense appears ideally as a\\nconscious representative state which we call \"sensation.\"\\n\"When,\" Leibniz says, \"the monad has its organs so°devel-oped\\ndeveloped that there is relief and differentiation in the°impres-sions\\nimpressions received, and consequently in the perceptions which\\nrepresent them, we have feeling or sensation; that is, a\\nperception accompanied by memory,\" to which at other\\ntimes he adds \"attention.\" Life, he says, \"is a perceptive\\nprinciple; the soul is sensitive life; mind is rational soul.\"\\nAnd again he says in substance that when the soul begins to\\nhave interests, and to regard one representation as of more\\nvalue than others, it introduces relief into its perceptions,\\nand those which stand out are called \"sensations.\"\\nThis origin of sensations as higher developments of the\\nrepresentative activities of a monad conditions their relation\\nto further processes of knowledge. The sensations are°con-fused\\nconfused knowledge; they are ideas in their primitive and most\\nundifferentiated form. They constitute, as Leibniz°some-where\\nsomewhere says, the vertigo of the conscious life. In every°sen-tient\\nsentient organism multitudes of sensations are constantly\\nthronging in and overpowering its distinct consciousness.\\nThe soul is so flooded with ideas of everything in the world\\nwhich has any relation to its body that it has distinct ideas of\\nnothing. Higher knowledge, then, does not consist in°com-pounding\\ncompounding these sensations; that would literally make°confu-sion\\nconfusion worse confounded. It consists in introducing°distinct-ness\\ndistinctness into the previously confused sensations,—in finding out\\nwhat they mean; that is, in finding out their bearings, what\\nthey point to, and how they are related. Knowledge is not an\\nexternal process performed upon the sensations, it is the\\ndevelopment of their internal content.\\nIt follows, therefore, that sensation is organic to all\\n\\n ― 319 ―\\n                            \\nforms of knowledge whatever. The monad, which is pure\\nactivity, that which culminates the scale of reality, has no\\nconfused ideas, and to it all knowledge is eternally rational,\\nhaving no sensible traces about it. But every other monad,\\nhaving its activity limited, has ideas which come to it at first\\nin a confused way, and which its activity afterwards°differ-entiates\\ndifferentiates. Thus it is that Leibniz can agree so heartily with\\nthe motto of the sensationalist school,—that there is nothing\\nin the intellect which was not first in the sensory. But\\nLeibniz uses this phrase as Aristotle would have done,°hav-ing\\nhaving in mind the distinction between potentiality and°actual-ity\\nactuality. In posse, sensation is all knowledge; but only in posse.\\nAnd he, like Aristotle, interprets the relation between°poten-tiality\\npotentiality and actuality as one of a difference of activity. The\\npotential is that which becomes real through a dynamic\\nprocess. The actual is capacity plus action. Sensation, in\\nshort, is spiritual activity in an undeveloped and hence°par-tial\\npartial and limited condition. It is not, as Locke would have it,\\nthe real factor in all knowledge.\\nThe marks of sensation which Locke lays down,—their\\npassivity, their simplicity, their position as the real element\\nin knowledge,—Leibniz either denies, therefore, or accepts\\nin a sense different from that of Locke. Strictly speaking,\\nsensation is an activity of the mind. There are no windows\\nthrough which the soul receives impressions. Pure passivity\\nof any kind is a myth, as scholastic fiction. Sensation is\\ndeveloped from the soul within; it is the activity of reality\\nmade manifest to itself. It is a higher kind of action than\\nanything we find in minerals or in plants. If we look at\\nsensation ideally, however, that is, according to the position\\nwhich it holds in the system of knowledge, it is properly\\nregarded as passive. It represents the limitation, the°unreal-ized\\nunrealized (that is, the non-active) side of spiritual life.\\n\"Efficient causality\" is a term which has its rightful\\nand legitimate use in physical science. Simply from the\\nscientific point of view we are correct in speaking of objects\\nas affecting the body, and the body, through its nervous\\nsystem, as affecting the soul and producing sensations. But\\nphilosophy does not merely use categories, it explains them.\\nAnd Leibniz contends that to explain the category of°causal-ity\\n ― 320 ―\\n                            \\ncausality in a mechanical sense, to understand by it physical°influ-ence\\ninfluence actually transferred from one thing to another, is to\\nmake the idea inexplicable and irrational. The true meaning\\nof causality is ideal. It signifies the relative positions which\\nthe objects concerned have in the harmonious system of°real-ity\\nreality. The body that is higher in the scale impresses the other;\\nthat is to say, it dominates it or gives its law. There is no\\nenergy or quality which passes physically from one to the\\nother. But one monad, as higher in the stage of development\\nthan another, makes an ideal demand upon that one. It places\\nbefore the other its own more real condition. The°less-devel-oped\\nless-developed monad, since its whole activity consists in representing\\nthe universe of reality, answers to this demand by°develop-ing\\ndeveloping the corresponding quality in itself. The category of\\nharmonious or co-operative action is thus substituted for that\\nof external and mechanical influence. Physical causality\\nwhen given a philosophic interpretation means organic°de-velopment\\ndevelopment. The reality of a higher stage is the more active:\\nthe more active has a greater content in that it mirrors the\\nuniverse more fully; it manifests accordingly more of the\\nlaw of the universe, and hence has an ideal domination over\\nthat which is lower in the scale. It is actually (that is, in\\nactivity) what the other is potentially. But as the entire\\nexistence of the latter is in representing or setting forth the\\nrelations which make the world, its activity is aroused to a\\ncorresponding production. Hence the former is called\\n\"cause,\" and the latter \"effect.\"\\nThis introduces us to the relation of soul and body, or,\\nmore generally stated, to the relation of mind and matter. It\\nis the theory of co-operation, of harmonious activity, which\\nLeibniz substitutes for the theory which Descartes had°for-mulated\\nformulated, according to which there are two opposed°sub-stances\\nsubstances which can affect each other only through the°me-dium\\nmedium of a Deus ex machina. Locke, on the other hand, took\\nthe Cartesian principle for granted, and thus enveloped°him-self\\nhimself in all the difficulties which surround the question of\\n\"mind and matter.\" Locke wavers between two positions, one\\nof which is that there are two unknown substances,—the soul\\nand the object in itself,—which, coming in contact, produce\\nsensations; while the other takes the hypothetical attitude\\n\\n ― 321 ―\\n                            \\nthat there may be but one substance,—matter,—and that\\nGod, out of the plenitude of his omnipotence, has given\\nmatter a capacity which does not naturally belong to it,—\\nthat of producing sensations. In either case, however, the\\nfinal recourse is to the arbitrary power of God. There is no\\nnatural-that is, intrinsic and explicable-connection°be-tween\\nbetween the sensation and that which produces it. Sensation\\noccupied the hard position which the mechanical school of\\nto-day still allots it. It is that \"inexplicable,\" \"mysterious,\"\\n\"unaccountable\" link between the domains of matter and\\nmind of which no rational account can be given, but which is\\nyet the source of all that we know about matter, and the\\nbasis of all that is real in the mind!\\nLeibniz, recognizing that reality is an organic whole,\\n—not two parts with a chasm between them,—says that\\n\"God does not arbitrarily give substances whatever qualities\\nmay happen, or that he may arbitrarily determine, but only\\nsuch as are natural; that is, such as are related to one\\nanother in an explicable way as modifications of the°sub-stance\\nsubstance.\" Leibniz feels sure that to introduce the idea of the\\ninexplicable, the purely supernatural, into the natural is to\\ngive up all the advantages which the modern mechanical\\ntheory had introduced, and to relapse into the meaningless\\nfeatures of scholasticism. If the \"supernatural\"—that is, the\\nessentially inexplicable-is introduced in this one case, why\\nshould it not be in others; why should we not return outright\\nto the \"fanatic philosophy which explains all facts by simply\\nattributing them to God immediately or by way of miracle,\\nor to the barbarian philosophy, which explains phenomena\\nby manufacturing, ad hoc, occult qualities or faculties,\\nseemingly like little demons or spirits capable of°perform-ing\\nperforming, without ceremony, whatever is required,—as if watches\\nmarked time by their horodeictic power, without wheels,\\nand mills ground grain, without grindstones, by their°frac-tive\\nfractive power\"? In fact, says Leibniz, by introducing the\\ninexplicable into our explanations \"we fall into something\\nworse than occult qualities,—we give up philosophy and\\nreason; we open asylums for ignorance and laziness, holding\\nnot only that there are qualities which we do not understand\\n(there are, indeed, too many such), but qualities which the\\n\\n ― 322 ―\\n                            \\ngreatest intelligence, if God gave it all the insight possible,\\ncould not understand,—that is, such as are in themselves\\nwithout rhyme or reason. And indeed it would be a thing\\nwithout rhyme or reason that God should perform miracles\\nin the ordinary course of nature.\" And regarding the whole\\nmatter of introducing the inconceivable and the inexplicable\\ninto science, he says that \"while the conception of men is not\\nthe measure of God\\'s power, their capacity of conception is\\nthe measure of nature\\'s power, since everything occurring in\\nthe natural order is capable of being understood by the\\ncreated intelligence.\" Such being the thought of Leibniz°re-garding\\nregarding the virtual attempt to introduce in his day the°un-knowable\\nunknowable into philosophy, it is evident that he must reject,\\nfrom the root up, all theories of sensation which, like\\nLocke\\'s, make it the product of the inexplicable intercourse\\nof two substances.\\nFor this doctrine, then, Leibniz substitutes that of an\\ninfinite number of substances, all of the same kind, all°ac-tive\\nactive, all developing from within, all conspiring to the same\\nend, but of various stages of activity, or bearing various°re-lations\\nrelations of completeness to the one end.\\nIndeed, one and the same monad has various degrees\\nof activity in itself; that is, it represents more or less°dis-tinctly\\ndistinctly the universe according to its point of view. Its point\\nof view requires of it, of course, primarily, a representation\\nof that which is about it. Thus an infinity of states arises,\\neach corresponding to some one of the multitude of objects\\nsurrounding the monad. The soul has no control, no°mas-tery\\nmastery, over these states. It has to take them as they come; with\\nregard to them, the soul appears passive. It appears so°be-cause\\nbecause it does not as yet clearly distinguish them. It does not\\nreact upon them and become conscious of their meaning or\\nthoroughly rational character. We shall afterwards see that\\n\"matter\" is, with Leibniz, simply this passive or confused\\nside of monads. It is the monad so far as it has not brought\\nto light the rational activity which is immanent in it. At\\npresent we need only notice that the body is simply the part\\nof matter or of passivity which limits the complete activity\\nof any monad. So Leibniz says, \"in so far as the soul has°per-fection\\nperfection, it has distinct thoughts, and God has accommodated\\n\\n ― 323 ―\\n                            \\nthe body to the soul. So far as it is imperfect and its°percep-tions\\nperceptions are confused, God has accommodated the soul to the\\nbody in such a way that the soul lets itself be inclined by the\\npassions, which are born from corporeal representations. It\\nis by its confused thoughts (sensations) that the soul°repre-sents\\nrepresents the bodies about it,\" just as, we may add, its distinct\\nthoughts represent the monads or souls about it, and, in the\\ndegree of their distinctness, God, the monad which is purus\\nactus.\\nFollowing the matter into more detail, we may say that\\nsince God alone is pure energy, knowing no limitation, God\\nalone is pure spirit. Every finite soul is joined to an organic\\nbody. \"I do not admit,\" says Leibniz, \"that there are souls\\nentirely separate from matter, nor created spirits detached\\nfrom body. . . . It is this body which the monad represents\\nmost distinctly; but since this body expresses the entire\\nuniverse by the connection of all matter throughout it, the\\nsoul represents the entire universe in representing the body\\nwhich belongs to it most particularly.\" But according to the\\nprinciple of continuity there must be in the least apparent\\nportion of matter still \"a universe of creatures, of souls, of\\nentelechies. There is nothing sterile, nothing dead in the\\nuniverse. It is evident from these considerations that every\\nliving body has a dominant entelechy, which is the soul in\\nthat body, but that the members of this living body are\\nagain full of other living beings and souls,\" which, however,\\nsince not of so high a grade, that is, not representing the\\nuniverse so fully, appear to be wholly material and subject\\nto the \"dominant\" entelechy; namely, to the one which gives\\nthe law to the others by expressing more adequately the idea\\nat which they only confusedly aim. Owing to the constant\\nchange of activity, however, these particles do not remain in\\nconstant subordination to the same entelechy (that is, do not\\nform parts of the same body), but pass on to higher or lower\\ndegrees of \"evolution,\" and have their places taken by\\nothers undergoing similar processes of change. Thus \"all\\nbodies are in a perpetual flux, like rivers, with parts°contin-ually\\ncontinually leaving and entering in.\" Or, interpreting this°figura-tive\\nfigurative language, each monad is continually, in its process of\\ndevelopment, giving law to new and less developed monads,\\n\\n ― 324 ―\\n                            \\nwhich therefore appear as its body. The nature of matter in\\nitself, and of its phenomenal manifestation in the body, are,\\nhowever, subjects which find no explanation here, and which\\nwill demand explanation in another chapter.\\nWe may sum up Leibniz\\'s theory of sensation by°say-ing\\nsaying that it is a representative state developed by the°self-ac-tivity\\nself-activity of the soul; that in itself it is a confused or \"involved\"\\ngrade of activity, and in its relation to the world represents\\nthe confused or passive aspects of existence; that this°limita-tion\\nlimitation of the monad constitutes matter, and in its necessary\\nconnection with the monad constitutes the body which is\\nalways joined to the finite soul; that to this body are joined\\nin all cases an immense number of monads, whose action is\\nsubordinate to that of this dominant monad, and that it is the\\ncollection of these which constitute the visible animal body.\\nThus if we look at sensation with regard to the monad which\\npossesses it, it is a product of the body of the monad; if we\\nlook at it with reference to other monads, it represents or\\nreflects their passive or material side. This is evidently one\\naspect again of the pre-established harmony,—an aspect in\\nwhich some of the narrower of Leibniz\\'s critics have seen\\nthe whole meaning of the doctrine exhausted. It is, however,\\nsimply one of the many forms in which the harmony, the\\nunion of spiritual and mechanical, ideal and material, meets\\nus. In truth, while in other systems the fact of sensation is a\\nfact demanding some artificial mode of reconciling \"mind\"\\nand \"matter,\" or is else to be accepted as an inexplicable\\nfact, in the system of Leibniz it is itself evidence that the\\nspiritual and the mechanical are not two opposed kinds of\\nexistence, but are organically united. It is itself the°manifes-tation\\nmanifestation of the harmony of the ideal and the material, not\\nsomething which requires that a factitious theory be°in-vented\\ninvented for explaining their appearance of harmony.°Sensa-tion\\nSensation has within itself the ideal element, for it is the°manifes-tation\\nmanifestation, in its most undeveloped form, of the spiritual°mean-ing\\nmeaning of the universe. It has a mechanical element, for it\\nexpresses the limitation, the passivity, of the monad.\\nIt is from this standpoint that Leibniz criticises what\\nLocke says about the relation of sensations to the objects\\nwhich produce them. Leibniz holds that all our sensations\\nhave a definite and natural connection with the qualities of\\n\\n ― 325 ―\\n                            \\nobjects,—the \"secondary\" as well as the \"primary.\" They\\nall represent certain properties of the object. Even the pain\\nwhich the thrust of a needle gives us, while it does not\\nresemble anything in the needle, does in some way represent\\nor resemble motions going on in our body. This resemblance\\nis not necessarily one of exact form, but just as the ellipse,\\nhyperbola, and parabola are projections of the circle in the\\nsense that there is a natural and fixed law of connection\\nbetween them, so that every point of one corresponds by a\\ncertain relation with every point of the other, so the°resem-blance\\nresemblance between the sensation and the quality of the object is\\nalways in the form of a fixed law of order, which, however\\nunknown to us it may now be, is capable of being found out.\\nIf we are to make any distinction between \"secondary\" and\\n\"primary\" sensations, it should be not that one presents\\nqualities that are in the objects, and the other affections\\nwhich exist only in us, but that the primary sensations (of\\nnumber, form, size, etc.) represent the qualities in a distinct\\nway, appealing to the rational activity of intelligence, while\\nthe secondary represent the qualities in a confused way, a\\nway not going beyond the effect upon the mind into°rela-tions\\nrelations, that is, into distinct knowledge.\\nThis brings regularly before us the question of the\\nrelation of sensations to knowledge. We have seen enough\\nalready to know that Leibniz does not believe that°knowl-edge\\nknowledge begins with the simple (that is, unrelated), and then\\nproceeds by a process of compounding. The sensation is not\\nsimple to Leibniz, but thoroughly complex, involving°con-fusedly\\nconfusedly within itself all possible relations. As relations are\\nbrought forth into distinct light out of this confusion,°knowl-edge\\nknowledge ends rather than begins with the simple. And again it\\nis evident that Leibniz cannot believe that knowledge begins\\nand ends in experience, in the sense in which both himself\\nand Locke use the word; namely, as meaning the°combina-tion\\ncombination and succession of impressions.\\n\"Experience,\" as they use the term, consists in°sensa-tions\\nsensations and their association,—\"consecution\" as Leibniz calls\\nit. Experience is the stage of knowledge reached by animals,\\nand in which the majority of men remain,—and indeed all\\nmen in the greater part of their knowledge. Leibniz takes\\njust the same position regarding the larger part of our\\n\\n ― 326 ―\\n                            \\nknowledge which Hume takes regarding it all. It consists\\nsimply in associations of such a nature that when one part\\nrecurs there is a tendency to expect the recurrence of the\\nother member. It resembles reason, but it is based on the\\naccidental experience of events in a consecutive order, and\\nnot on knowledge of their causal connection. We all expect\\nthe sun to rise to-morrow; but with all of us, excepting the\\nastronomer, such expectation is purely \"empirical,\" being\\nbased on the images of past experiences which recur. The\\nastronomer, however, sees into the grounds, that is, the\\nreasons, of the expectation, and hence his knowledge is\\nrational.\\nThus we have two grades of knowledge,—one°empiri-cal\\nempirical, consisting of knowledge of facts; the other rational,\\nbeing of the truths of reason. The former is contingent and\\nparticular, the latter is necessary and universal. Leibniz\\ninsists, with a pertinacity which reminds us of Kant, that\\n\"experience\" can give instances or examples only, and that\\nthe fact that anything has happened in a given way any\\nnumber of times in the past, can give no assurance that it\\nwill continue to do so in the future. There is nothing in the\\nnature of the case which renders its exact opposite°impossi-ble\\nimpossible. But a rational truth is necessary, for its opposite is\\nimpossible, being irrational or meaningless. This may not\\nalways be evident in the case of a complex rational truth; but\\nif it be analyzed into simpler elements, as a geometrical\\nproposition into definitions, axioms, and postulates, the°ab-surdity\\nabsurdity of its opposite becomes evident. Sensation, in°conclu-sion\\nconclusion, is the having of confused ideas,—ideas corresponding\\nto matter. Experience is the association of these confused\\nideas, and their association according to their accidental\\njuxtaposition in the life of the soul. It therefore is not only\\nthoroughly sensible, but is also phenomenal. Its content is\\nsensations; its form is contingent and particular consecution.\\nBoth form and content, accordingly, need to be°recon-structed\\nreconstructed if they are to be worthy of the name of science or of\\nknowledge. This is the position which Leibniz assumes as\\nagainst the empiricist, Locke. The details of this°reconstruc-tion\\nreconstruction, its method and result, we must leave till we come in the\\ncourse of the argument again to the subject of knowledge.\\n\\n ― 327 ―\\n                            \\n6: The Impulses and the WillLocke, after discussing the subject of innate ideas in their\\nrelation to knowledge, goes on to discuss their practical side,\\nor connection with will. We shall follow him in this as\\nLeibniz does; but we shall consider in connection with this,\\nLeibniz\\'s general theory of will, which is developed partially\\nin this chapter, but more completely in his critical remarks\\nupon what Locke has to say of the notion of \"power.\" Since\\nthe theory of morals is as closely connected with will as the\\ntheory of knowledge is with the intellect, we shall°supple-ment\\nsupplement this discussion with what Leibniz says upon the ethical\\nquestion, drawing our material somewhat freely from his\\nother writings.\\nThe doctrine of will which Leibniz propounds is in\\nclosest harmony with his conception of intelligence, and this\\nnot merely in the way of empirical juxtaposition, but as the\\nresult of his fundamental principles. If we recall what has\\nbeen said concerning the monad, we shall remember that it\\nis an activity, but an activity with a content. It is a force, but\\na force which mirrors the universe. The content, that°por-tion\\nportion of reality which is reflected in the action, is knowledge,\\nor the idea; the activity which brings this about is will, or\\nthe volition. They are related to each other as form and\\ncontent. There is, strictly speaking, no \"state\" of mind;\\nthere is only a tension, a pushing forward of mind. There is\\nno idea which is not a volition. Will is thus used, in a very\\nbroad sense, as equivalent to action. Since, however, the\\nactivity of the monad is in no case aimless, but has an end in\\nview, the will is not mere activity in general, it is action\\ntowards some definite end. And since the end at which the\\nmonad aims is always the development of an idea, the°reflec-tion\\n ― 328 ―\\n                            \\nreflection of some constituent of the universe, the will is always\\ndirected towards and determined by some idea of the°intel-lect\\nintellect.\\nWe have seen, however, that there are various stages\\nin the reflecting power of the soul, or in the realization of\\nintellect. Taking only the broadest division, there are°per-ception\\nperception and apperception; that is, there are the conscious and\\nthe unconscious mirroring of reality. We shall expect, then,\\nto find two corresponding stages of volition. Leibniz calls\\nthese stages \"appetition\" and \"volition\" in the narrower\\nsense. The constant tendency in every monad to go from one\\nperception to another,—that is, the following of the law of\\ndevelopment,—constitutes appetition. If joined to feeling, it\\nconstitutes instinct. Since, again, there are two degrees of\\napperception, one of empirical, the other of rational,°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, we shall expect to find two grades of volition\\nproper,—one corresponding to action for conscious°particu-lar\\nparticular ends; the other for ends which are proposed by reason,\\nand are hence universal. In this chapter we shall simply\\nexpand and illustrate these various propositions.\\nSensations, looked at not as to what they represent, but\\nin themselves, are impulses. As such they constitute the\\nlowest stage of will. Impulsive action then includes all such\\nas occurs for an end which is unknown, or at best but dimly\\nfelt. Such action may be called blind, not in the sense that it\\nis without reason, but in the sense that reason is not°con-sciously\\nconsciously present. We are not to think of this instinctive\\naction, however, as if it were found simply in the animals.\\nMuch of human action is also impulsive; probably, indeed,\\nan impulsive factor is contained in our most rational willing.\\nWe are never able to take complete account of the agencies\\nwhich are acting upon us. Along with the reasons of which\\nwe are conscious in choosing, there are mingled faint°memo-ries\\nmemories of past experience, subconscious solicitations of the°pres-ent\\npresent, dim expectations for the future. Such elements are\\ndecisive factors far more than we realize.\\nIndeed, it is because of the extent to which such°uncon-scious\\nunconscious influences bear upon us and move us that there arises\\nthe idea of indifferent or unmotivated choice. Were both\\nmotive and choice unconscious, the question as to whether\\n\\n ― 329 ―\\n                            \\nchoice were antecedently determined would not arise; and\\nwere our motives and their results wholly in consciousness,\\nthe solution of the question would be evident. But when we\\nare conscious of our choice, but are not conscious of our\\nimpulses and motives, we get the impression that our choice\\nis unmotivated, and hence come to believe in \"indifferent\\nfreedom,\"—the ability to choose as we will.\\nWe shall shortly take up in more detail the theory of\\nLeibniz regarding the freedom of will; and it is needful here\\nto remark only that the conception which makes it consist in\\nability to choose without reason is in direct contradiction to\\nhis fundamental thought,—namely, that there can be no\\nactivity which does not aim at some reflection of the°uni-verse\\nuniverse, by which, therefore, it is determined. From the°psy-chological\\npsychological point of view, it is interesting also to notice how\\nLeibniz\\'s theory of unconscious ideas enables him to dispose\\nof the strongest argument for indifferent choice,—that\\ndrawn from the immediate \"testimony\" of consciousness.\\nUpon the origin and nature of desires Leibniz has\\nmuch more to say than about the impulses. His account of\\nthe transition from impulse to desire is based upon the\\nconception of unconscious ideas. Slight and imperceptible\\nimpulses are working upon us all the time. Indeed, they are\\na necessity; for the actual state of a soul or monad at any\\ntime is, of course, one of incompleteness. Our nature must\\nalways work to free itself from its hindrances and obtain its\\ngoal of complete development. But it will not do this unless\\nthere is some stimulus, some solicitation to induce it to\\novercome its limitation. There is found accordingly in our\\nevery condition a feeling of dissatisfaction, or, using Locke\\'s\\nword, of \"uneasiness\"; and it is this which calls forth that\\nactivity which brings about a nearer approach to the soul\\'s\\nreal good. But Leibniz differs from Locke in saying that this\\nfeeling of uneasiness is not a distinct, or even in most cases a\\nconscious, one. It is not pain, although it differs from pain\\nonly in degree. Uneasiness and pain are related to each other\\nas appetite for food is to hunger,—the first suffices to°stimu-late\\nstimulate us to satisfaction, but if the want is not met, results in\\nactual pain; if met, these \"half-pains\" become tributary to\\npleasure itself. These unconscious stimuli to action result in\\n\\n ― 330 ―\\n                            \\nactions which meet the want, and the aggregation of these\\nsatisfactions results in pleasure. In Leibniz\\'s own words:—\\n\"If these elements of pain were themselves true pains,\\nwe should always be in a state of misery, even in pursuing\\nthe good. But since there is always going on a summation of\\nminute successes in overcoming these states of uneasiness,\\nand these put us more and more at ease, there comes about a\\ndecided pleasure, which often has greater value even than\\nthe enjoyment of the good. Far, then, from regarding this\\nuneasiness as a thing incompatible with happiness, I find\\nthat it is an essential condition of our happiness. For this\\ndoes not consist in perfect possession, which would make us\\ninsensible and stupid, but in a constant progress towards\\ngreater results, which must always be accompanied,°accord-ingly\\naccordingly, by this element of desire or uneasiness.\"\\nAnd again he says that \"we enjoy all the advantages of\\npain without any of its inconveniences. If the uneasiness\\nshould become too distinct, we should be miserable in our\\nawaiting the good which relieves it; but as it is, there is a\\nconstant victory over these half-pains, which we always find\\nin desire, and this gives us a quantity of half-pleasures,\\nwhose continuance and summation (for they acquire force\\nlike a moving body as it falls) result in a whole and true\\npleasure.\" In short, there is indeed an element of pain in all\\ndesire which stimulates us to action, and therefore to higher\\ndevelopment. But ordinarily this element of pain is not°pres-ent\\npresent as such in consciousness, but is absorbed in the pleasure\\nwhich accompanies the realization of the higher good. Thus\\nLeibniz, accepting and emphasizing the very same fact that\\nserved Schopenhauer as a psychological base of pessimism,\\nuses it as a foundation-stone of optimism.\\nBut desire, or the conscious tendency towards°some-thing\\nsomething required as a good, accompanied by the dim feeling of\\nuneasiness at its absence, does not yet constitute the°com-plete\\ncomplete act of volition. \"Several impulses and inclinations meet\\nin forming the complete volition which is the result of their\\nconflict.\" In the concrete act of will there are contained\\nimpulses which push us towards some end whose nature is\\nnot known; there is desire both in its inchoate stage, where\\npleasure and pain are not in consciousness, and in its formed\\n\\n ― 331 ―\\n                            \\nstate, where the pain and pleasure are definitely presented.\\nMixed with these desires and impulses are images of past\\nexperiences which call up the feelings which were formerly\\nattached to them, and thus there are aroused indirectly\\nadditional impulses and desires. Out of this complicated\\nmass of impulses, desires, and feelings, both original and\\nreproduced, comes the \"dominant effort\" which constitutes\\ncomplete will. But what governs the production of this°pre-vailing\\nprevailing or dominant effort, which we may interpret as the act\\nof choice? The answer is simple: the result of the conflict of\\nthese various factors, the striking of the balance, is the\\nchoice. Some desire emerges from the confused complex,\\nand that desire is the final determination of the will. This\\ndesire may not in all cases be the strongest in itself,—that is,\\nthe one whose satisfaction will allay the greatest°\"uneasi-ness\\n\"uneasiness,\" for the others, taken together, may outweigh it; it\\nmay, so to speak, have a plurality, but not a majority, of\\nvolitional forces on its side,—and in this case a fusion of\\nopposing factors may defeat it. But in any event the result\\nwill be the algebraic sum of the various desires and°im-pulses\\nimpulses.\\nIt is not at all necessary, however, that the net outcome\\nshall make itself apparent as a mechanical equivalent of the\\nforces at work. The soul, Leibniz says, may use its skill in\\nthe formation of parties, so as to make this or that side the\\nvictor. How is this to be done, and still disallow the°possibil-ity\\npossibility of arbitrary choice? This problem is solved through\\naction becoming deliberate. Deliberate action is impossible\\nunless the soul has formed the habit of looking ahead and of\\narranging for modes of action which do not present°them-selves\\nthemselves as immediate necessities. Only in this way can one\\nlook at the matter impartially and coolly; \"at the moment of\\ncombat there is no time for discussion. Everything which\\nthen occurs throws its full force on the balance, and°contrib-utes\\ncontributes to an outcome made up in the same way as in°mechan-ics\\nmechanics.\" The formation of certain habits beforehand, therefore,\\nis the secret of translating impulsive action into the°deliber-ate\\ndeliberate sphere.\\nOf these habits the simplest consists in thinking only\\noccasionally and incidentally of certain things. Imagination\\n\\n ― 332 ―\\n                            \\nis the mother of desire. If we do not allow the imagination to\\ndwell upon certain lines of thought, the probability of such\\nthoughts acquiring sufficient force to become motives of\\nweight is small. A still more effective method of regulating\\naction is \"to accustom ourselves to forming a train of\\nthoughts of which reason, and not chance (that is,°associa-tion\\nassociation), is the basis. We must get out of the tumult of present\\nimpressions, beyond our immediate surroundings, and ask:\\nDic cur hic? respice finem!\" In other words, we must cross-\\nquestion our impulses and desires, we must ask whence they\\ncome, that we may see how valid are the credentials which\\nthey offer. We must ask whither they tend, that we may\\nmeasure them, not by their immediate interest, but by their\\nrelation to an end. The desires are not to be taken at their\\nface-value, but are to be weighed and compared.\\nSuch a process will evidently result in arresting°instan-taneous\\ninstantaneous action. There will be a pause between the°presenta-tion\\npresentation of the desires and the overt act. During this pause it\\nmay well occur that the examination to which the desires\\nhave been subject has awakened contrary desires. The\\nthought of the ignoble origin of a desire or of its repulsive,\\nthough remote, result will bring into action desires of an\\nopposed kind. Thus the soul regulates action, not as if,\\nhowever, it had any direct influence over desires, but by its\\nability of bringing other desires into the field. The will, in\\nshort, is not opposed to desire, though rational desire may be\\nopposed to sensuous desire. \"By various artifices, then,\"\\nLeibniz concludes, \"we become masters of ourselves, and\\ncan make ourselves think and do that which we ought to\\nwill, and which reason ordains.\" Such is the summary of\\nLeibniz\\'s analysis of the elements and mechanism of°voli-tion\\nvolition. There was not much psychology existing at the time\\nwhich could aid him in such an acute and subtle account;\\nonly in Aristotle could he have found much help. On the\\nother hand, it has been so generally incorporated into°cur-rent\\ncurrent psychology that we may seem to have wasted space in\\nrepeating truisms.\\nOf moral action, however, we have as yet heard°noth-ing\\nnothing. We have an account of a psychological mechanism; but\\nfor what ethical end does this work, and by what method?\\n\\n ― 333 ―\\n                            \\nThis question may best be answered by turning in more\\ndetail to the question of the \"freedom of the will.\" Freedom\\nin the sense of arbitrary choice Leibniz wholly rejects, as we\\nhave seen. It is inconsistent with at least two of his°funda-mental\\nfundamental principles; those, namely, of sufficient reason, and of\\ncontinuity. \"Everything that occurs must have a sufficient\\nreason for its occurrence.\" This oft-repeated dictum of°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz, the logical way of stating the complete rationality of\\nexperience, would be shattered into fragments by collision\\nwith groundless choice. It conflicts equally (indeed for the\\nsame reason) with the principle of continuity. \"The present\\nis pregnant with the future.\" \"Nature never makes leaps.\"\\n\"An absolute equilibrium is a chimera.\" \"The soul is never\\nwholly at rest.\" These are only various ways of saying that\\nthe notion of arbitrary or unmotivated choice rests upon the\\nassumption that there is a complete break in the life of the\\nsoul, so that it is possible for something to happen which\\nbears no organic relation to anything that precedes. The\\nnotion of a state of the soul without motives, followed by the\\nirruption of a certain line of conduct, the notion of an°equi-librium\\nequilibrium broken by arbitrary choice, is simply the°counter-part\\ncounterpart of the idea of a vacuum. All that makes Leibniz reject\\nthe latter conception makes it impossible for him to accept\\nthe former.\\nThis should not be interpreted to mean that Leibniz\\ndenied the \"freedom of the will.\" What he denied is a notion\\nof freedom which seemed to him at once unverifiable,°use-less\\nuseless, and irrational. There is a conception of freedom which\\nLeibniz not only accepts, but insists upon. Such a notion of\\nfreedom is indeed his ethical ideal. Its three traits are°contin-gency\\ncontingency, spontaneity, and rationality of action. How action can\\nbe at the same time contingent and determined is perhaps\\ndifficult to understand; but Leibniz takes the position that it\\nis. His first step is to distinguish between physical,°mathe-matical\\nmathematical, metaphysical, and moral necessity. There are truths\\nwhich are eternal, truths which are absolutely necessary,\\nbecause their opposites involve contradiction. They cannot\\nbe violated without involving us in absurdity. There are\\nother truths which are \"positive,\" that is, ordained for good\\nreason. These truths may be a priori, or rational, and not\\n\\n ― 334 ―\\n                            \\nmerely empirical; for they have been chosen for reasons of\\nadvantage. God always chooses and ordains the best of a\\nnumber of possibilities; but he does it, not because the\\nopposite is impossible, but because it is inferior. Truths\\nwhose opposites are impossible have metaphysical and°math-ematical\\nmathematical necessity. Positive truths have moral necessity. The\\nprinciple of causation must be true; the three interior angles\\nof a triangle must be equal to two right angles. But that God\\nshall choose the better of two courses is a moral necessity\\nonly. It involves no absolute logical contradiction to conceive\\nhim choosing some other way. Upon moral necessity°de-pends\\ndepends the physical. The particular laws of nature are°neces-sary\\nnecessary, not because their opposites are logically absurd, but\\nbecause these laws are most in accordance with the general\\nprinciples of good and order, in agreement with which God\\nchooses. Physical and moral action is therefore in all cases\\ncontingent. (Contingency does not of itself, of course,°con-stitute\\nconstitute freedom, but conjoined with the characteristics of\\nrationality and spontaneity, does so.)\\nNecessity, in short, is based upon the principle of°logi-cal\\nlogical contradiction; contingency upon that of sufficient reason.\\nSince our actions are in no case necessitated in such a way\\nthat their opposite is self-contradictory, or, put positively,\\nsince our actions are always determined by the choice of that\\nwhich seems best, our actions are contingent. Occasionally\\nLeibniz puts the matter in a much simpler way, and one\\nwhich brings out the essential element more clearly than the\\nforegoing distinction. Some facts are determined by the\\nprinciple of physical causation; others by that of final°causa-tion\\ncausation. Some, in other words, are necessary as the mechanical\\noutcome of their antecedents; others are necessary as°in-volved\\ninvolved in the reaching of a given end. It is simply the\\nAristotelian distinction between efficient and teleological\\ncausation. Human action is determined, since it always has a\\nmotive or reason; it is contingent, because it springs from\\nthis reason and not from its temporal antecedents. It is, in\\nshort, determined, but it is also free.\\nIt does not require much analysis, however, to see that\\nthis distinction, in whatever way it be put, really has no\\nsignificance, except as it points to the other marks of°free-dom\\n ― 335 ―\\n                            \\nfreedom,—spontaneity and rationality. As we shall see, Leibniz\\nmakes and can make no absolute distinction between truths\\nof reason and truths of fact. The contingent and the°neces-sary\\nnecessary are one at bottom. To us with our limited intelligence it\\ndoes indeed often appear as if no contradiction were involved\\nin the former,—as if, for example, a man could turn either to\\nright or left without there being any logical contradiction in\\neither case; but this is because of our defective insight. An\\nintelligence cognizant of the whole matter could see that one\\naction would contradict some truth involved in the°constitu-tion\\nconstitution of the universe. The source of the contingent and\\nchanging is in the necessary and eternal. Thus it is that\\nalthough Leibniz at one time says that \"neither one\\'s self\\nnor any other spirit more enlightened could demonstrate\\nthat the opposite of a given action (like going out in°prefer-ence\\npreference to staying in) involves contradiction,\" at another time\\nhe says that \"a perfect knowledge of all the circumstances,\\ninternal and external, would enable any one to foresee\" the\\ndecision in a given case. If that be so, any other action must\\nbe impossible; that is, according to Leibniz\\'s invariable\\nlogic, imply contradiction.\\nWe get the same result if we consider the relation of\\nfinal and efficient causes. It is only when speaking in a very\\ngeneral way that Leibniz opposes action as determined by\\nprecedent activities to that directed towards the attainment\\nof an end. He does not really mean that some action is\\nphysical, while other is teleological. He cannot suppose that\\nsome action has an antecedent cause, while other has a\\npurpose. The very essence of his thought is that action is\\nboth mechanical and teleological; that all action follows in a\\nlaw of order from precedent action, and that all fulfils a\\ncertain spiritual function. The distinction is not, with°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz, one between two kinds of action, but between two ways\\nof looking at every action. The desire to go rather than to\\nstay, has its efficient cause; the movements by which the\\ndesire is executed, have their final cause. The truth of the\\nmatter seems to be that Leibniz in his desire to guard\\nagainst being thought a fatalist, or one denying all freedom,\\nuses terms which are compatible only with a freedom of\\nindifference. So in his statement that man\\'s action is free\\n\\n ― 336 ―\\n                            \\nbecause \"contingent,\" he seems actuated rather by a wish to\\navoid the hateful term \"necessity\" than by considerations\\nstrictly in harmony with his own principles.\\nHad he confined his use of the term \"contingent,\"\\nhowever, simply to re-stating the fact that human action is\\nspontaneous, no such apparent contradiction would have\\npresented itself. Human actions may be called contingent, as\\nphysical actions are not, because the latter always seem to be\\nexternally determined, while the former are internally°di-rected\\ndirected. Motions act from without; motives from within. The\\ncause of the falling of a stone lies outside it; the source of a\\ndesire which moves to action is from the mind itself. We are\\nthus introduced to contingency as a synonym of°\"spontane-ity\\n\"spontaneity.\"\\nKuno Fischer calls attention to the fact that Spinoza\\nand Leibniz both use the same sort of illustration to show\\nthe non-arbitrary character of human action, but the same\\nillustration with a difference; and in the difference he finds\\nthe distinction between the two philosophies. Spinoza says\\nthat a stone falling to the ground, if endowed with°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, might imagine itself following its own will in\\nfalling. Leibniz says that a magnetic needle similarly°en-dowed\\nendowed might imagine that it turned towards the north°sim-ply\\nsimply because it wished. Both examples are used to illustrate\\nthe folly of relying upon the immediate \"testimony\" of\\nconsciousness. But the example of Spinoza is that of an\\nobject, all whose movements are absolutely necessitated\\nfrom without; the example of Leibniz is that of an object\\nwhose activity, though following law, and not caprice, is\\napparently initiated from within. Of course in reality the\\nmovements of the magnetic needle are just as much°exter-nally\\nexternally conditioned as those of the stone; but the appearance of\\nself-action in the latter case may serve at least to exemplify\\nwhat is meant by spontaneity as attributed to human action.\\nIt must be noticed at the outset that spontaneity°be-longs\\nbelongs to every simple substance. We have only to recall the\\ndoctrine of monads. These suffer nothing from without, all\\ntheir activity is the expression, is the unfolding, of their own\\nlaw. \"By nature,\" Leibniz says, \"every simple substance\\nhas perceptions, and its individuality consists in the°perma-nent\\npermanent law which forms the succession of its perceptions, that\\n\\n ― 337 ―\\n                            \\nare born naturally one of another. Hence it is not necessary\\nfor it to receive any physical influence from without; and\\ntherefore the soul has in itself a perfect spontaneity in such a\\nway that its actions depend only upon God and itself.\" Or if\\nwe put the matter in its connection with his psychology\\nrather than with his metaphysics, it is true that our actions\\nare determined by our motives; but motives are not forces\\nwithout the soul, they are forces of the soul. In acting\\naccording to motives the soul is simply acting according to\\nits own laws. A desire is not an impulsion from an external\\ncause; it is the expression of an inward tendency. To say\\nthat the soul acts from the strongest desire is simply to say,\\nfrom this standpoint, that it manifests the most real part of\\nitself, not that it obeys a foreign force. Impulses, desires,\\nmotives, are all psychical; they admit of no description or\\nexplanation except in their relation to the soul itself. Thus\\nwhen Leibniz compares, as he often does, motives to weights\\nacting upon a balance, we are to remember that the balance\\nis not to be conceived as the soul, and the weights as°ener-gies\\nenergies outside it, but that this is only a way of picturing what\\nis going on within the soul itself. The soul may be a°mecha-nism\\nmechanism, but it is a self-directing and self-executing mechanism.\\nTo say that human action is free because it is spontaneous, is\\nto say that it follows an immanent principle, that it is°inde-pendent\\nindependent of foreign influences,—in a word, that it is°self-de-termined\\nself-determined.\\nBut here again it seems as if Leibniz had stated a\\nprinciple altogether too wide to throw any light upon the\\nnature of moral freedom. Spontaneity is no more an attribute\\nof human activity than it is of all real activity. Every monad,\\neven the unconscious, as truly follows its own law without\\ninterference from without as does man himself. If the°spon-taneity\\nspontaneity of action constitutes its morality, we are not in a\\ncondition to ascribe morality to man any more than to any\\nreal thing. We are thus thrown back again upon the°concep-tion\\nconception of rationality as the final and decisive trait of freedom\\nand of ethical conduct. Just as \"contingency\" gets a moral\\nimport only in connection with conscious ends of action, so\\n\"spontaneity\" comes within the moral realm only when\\nconjoined to reason.\\nWhy is there this close connection between reason and\\n\\n ― 338 ―\\n                            \\nfreedom? The reader has only to recall what was said of\\nLeibniz\\'s theory of causality to get a glimpse into their\\nunity. Causality is not a matter of physical influence, but of\\naffording the reason in virtue of which some fact is what it\\nis. This applies of course to the relation of the soul and the\\nbody. \"So far as the soul is perfect and has distinct ideas,\\nGod has accommodated the body to it; so far as the soul is\\nimperfect and its ideas are confused, God has°accommo-dated\\naccommodated the soul to the body. In the former case the body\\nalways responds to the demands of the soul; in the latter the\\nsoul is moved by the passions which are born of the sensuous\\nideas. Each is thought to act upon the other in the measure\\nof its perfection [that is, degree of activity], since God has\\nadjusted one thing to another according to its perfection or\\nimperfection. Activity and passivity are always reciprocal in\\ncreated things, because a portion of the reasons which serve\\nto explain what goes on is in one substance, and another\\nportion in the other. This is what makes us call one active,\\nthe other passive.\"\\nIf we translate these ideas out of their somewhat°scho-lastic\\nscholastic phraseology, the meaning is that the self-activity of\\nany substance is accurately measured by the extent to which\\nit contains the reasons for its own actions; and conversely,\\nthat it is dependent or enslaved just so far as it has its\\nreasons beyond itself. Sensations, sensuous impulses,°repre-sent\\nrepresent, as we have seen before, the universe only in a confused\\nand inarticulate way. They are knowledge which cannot\\ngive an account of itself. They represent, in short, that side\\nof mind which may be regarded as affected, or the limitation\\nof mind,—its want of activity. So far as the mind acts from\\nthese sensations and the feelings which accompany them, it\\nis ideally determined from without; it is a captive to its own\\nstates; it is in a condition of passivity. In all action,°there-fore\\ntherefore, which occurs from a sensuous basis, the soul is rightly\\nregarded as unfree.\\nOn the other hand, just in the degree in which°distinct-ness\\ndistinctness is introduced into the sensations, so that they are not\\nsimply experienced as they come, but are related to one\\nanother so that their reason for existence, their spiritual\\nmeaning, is ascertained, just in that degree is the soul°mas-ter\\n ― 339 ―\\n                            \\nmaster of itself. In Leibniz\\'s own words: \"Distinct knowledge\\nor intelligence has its place in the true use of reason, while\\nthe senses furnish confused ideas. Hence we can say that we\\nare free from slavery just in the degree that we act with\\ndistinct knowledge, but are subject to our passions in just\\nthe degree that our ideas are confused\"; that is, not really\\nrepresentative of things as they are. \"Intelligence is the soul\\nof liberty.\"\\nThis psychological explanation rests, of course, upon\\nthe foundation principle of the Leibnizian philosophy. Spirit\\nis the sole reality, and spirit is activity. But there are various\\ndegrees of activity, and each grade lower than the purus\\nactus may be rightfully regarded as in so far passive. This\\nrelative passivity or unreality constitutes the material and\\nhence the sensuous world. One who has not insight into\\ntruth, lives and acts in this world of comparative unreality;\\nhe is in bondage to it. From this condition of slavery only\\nreason, the understanding of things as they are, can lift one.\\nThe rational man is free because he acts, in the noble words\\nof Spinoza, sub specie æternitatis. He acts in view of the\\neternal truth of things,—as God himself would act.\\nGod alone, it further follows, is wholly free. In him\\nalone are understanding and will wholly one. In him the true\\nand the good are one; while every created intelligence is\\nsubject in some degree to sensuous affection, to passion. \"In\\nus, besides the judgment of the understanding, there is\\nalways mixed some unreal idea of the sensation which gives\\nbirth to passions and impulses, and these traverse the°judg-ment\\njudgment of the practical understanding.\" Freedom, in fine, is\\nnot a ready-made garment with which all men are clothed to\\ndo with as they will. It is the ethical ideal; it is something to\\nbe attained; it is action in conformity with reason, or insight\\ninto the spiritual nature of reality and into its laws; it is not\\nthe starting-point, it is the goal. Only with a great price do\\nmen purchase such freedom. It will be noticed at once that\\nLeibniz comes very close to Plato in his fundamental ethical\\nideas. The unity of virtue and reason, of virtue and freedom,\\n—these are thoroughly Platonic conceptions. To both Plato\\nand Leibniz reason is the ethical ideal because it is the\\nexpression of, nay, rather, is the reality of the universe;\\n\\n ― 340 ―\\n                            \\nwhile all else is, as Leibniz says, imperfect or unreal, since it\\nis not an activity, or, as Plato says, a mixture of Being and\\nNon-Being. Again, to both man bears a similar relation to\\nthis spiritual reality. In Plato\\'s words, he participates in the\\nIdeas; in those of Leibniz he reflects, as a mirror, the°uni-verse\\nuniverse. To both, in a word, the reality, the true-self of the\\nindividual, is the spiritual universe of which it is an organic\\nmember. To both, therefore, man obtains freedom or°self-re-alization\\nself-realization only as he realizes his larger and more°comprehen-sive\\ncomprehensive identity with the Reason of the universe. With both,\\nknowledge is the good, ignorance is the evil. No man is\\nvoluntarily bad, but only through lack of knowledge of the\\ntrue Good. Leibniz, however, with a more developed°psy-chology\\npsychology, supplements Plato in the point where the latter had\\nthe most difficulty,—the possibility of the feelings or of a\\nlove of pleasure overcoming knowledge of the Good. This\\npossibility Plato was compelled to deny, while Leibniz, by\\nhis subtle identifying of the passions with lack of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, or with confused knowledge, can admit it. \"It is an\\nimperfection of our freedom,\" says Leibniz, \"which causes\\nus to choose evil rather than good,—a greater evil rather\\nthan the less, the less good rather than the greater. This\\ncomes from the appearances of good and evil which deceive\\nus; but God, who is perfect knowledge, is always led to the\\ntrue and to the best good, that is, to the true and absolute\\ngood.\"\\nIt only remains briefly to apply these conceptions to\\nsome specific questions of moral actions. Locke asks\\nwhether there are practical innate ideas, and denies them, as\\nhe denies theoretical. Leibniz, in replying, recognizes two\\nkinds of \"innate\" practical principles, one of which is to be\\nreferred to the class of instincts, the other to that of maxims.\\nPrimarily, and probably wholly in almost all men, moral\\ntruths take the rank of instincts alone. All men aim at the\\nGood; it is impossible to think of man wilfully seeking his\\nown evil. The methods, the means of reaching this Good,\\nare implanted in men as instincts. These instincts, when\\nbrought to the light of reason and examined, become°max-ims\\nmaxims of action; they lose their particular and impulsive°char-acter\\ncharacter, and become universal and deliberate principles. Thus\\n\\n ― 341 ―\\n                            \\nLeibniz is enabled to answer the various objections which\\nare always brought against any \"intuitive\" theory of moral\\nactions,—the variability of men\\'s moral beliefs and conduct\\nin different countries and at different times. Common°in-stincts\\ninstincts, but at first instincts only, are present in all men\\nwhenever and wherever they live. These instincts may°read-ily\\nreadily be \"resisted by men\\'s passions, obscured by prejudice,\\nand changed by custom.\" The moral instincts are always\\nthe basis of moral action, but \"custom, tradition, education\"\\nbecome mixed with them. Even when so confounded,°how-ever\\nhowever, the instinct will generally prevail, and custom is, upon\\nthe whole, on the side of right rather than wrong, so that\\nLeibniz thinks there is a sense in which all men have one\\ncommon morality.\\nBut these moral instincts, even when pure, are not\\nethical science. This is innate, Leibniz says, only in the\\nsense in which arithmetic is innate,—it depends upon°dem-onstrations\\ndemonstrations which reason furnishes. Leibniz does not, then,\\noppose intuitive and demonstrative, as sometimes happens.\\nMorality is practically intuitive in the sense that all men\\ntend to aim at the Good, and have an instinctive feeling of\\nwhat makes towards the Good. It is theoretically°demonstra-tive\\ndemonstrative, since it does not become a science until Reason has an\\ninsight into the nature of the Good, and ascertains the fixed\\nlaws which are tributary to it. Moral principles are not\\nintuitive in the sense that they are immediately discovered as\\nseparate principles by some one power of the soul called\\n\"conscience.\" Moral laws are intuitive, he says, \"as the\\nconsequences of our own development and our true well-\\nbeing.\" Here we may well leave the matter. What is to be\\nsaid in detail of Leibniz\\'s ethics will find its congenial home\\nin what we have to say of his theology.\\n\\n ― 342 ―\\n                            \\n7: Matter and Its Relation to SpiritLocke\\'s account of innate ideas and of sensation is only\\npreparatory to a discussion of the ideas got by sensation. His\\nexplanation of the mode of knowledge leads up to an°ex-planation\\nexplanation of the things known. He remains true to his°funda-mental\\nfundamental idea that before we come to conclusions about any\\nmatters we must \"examine our own ability.\" He deals first\\nwith ideas got by the senses, whether by some one or by\\ntheir conjoint action. Of these the ideas of solidity, of°exten-sion\\nextension, and of duration are of most concern to us. They form\\nas near an approach to a general philosophy of nature as\\nmay be found anywhere in Locke. They are, too, the germ\\nfrom which grew the ideas of matter, of space, and of time,\\nwhich, however more comprehensive in scope and more\\namply worked out in detail, characterize succeeding British\\nthought, and which are reproduced to-day by Mr. Spencer.\\n\"The idea of solidity we receive by our touch.\" \"The\\nideas we get by more than one sense are of space or°exten-sion\\nextension, figure, rest, and motion.\" These sentences contain the\\nbrief statement of the chief contention of the sensational\\nschool. Locke certainly was not conscious when he wrote\\nthem that they were the expression of ideas which should\\nresolve the world of matter and of space into a dissolving\\nseries of accidentally associated sensations; but such was\\nnone the less the case. When he writes, \"If any one asks me\\nwhat solidity is, I send him to his senses to inform him,\" he\\nis preparing the way for Berkeley, and for a denial of all\\nreality beyond the feelings of the individual mind. When he\\nsays that \"we get the idea of space both by sight and touch,\"\\nthis statement, although appearing truistic, is none the less\\nthe source of the contention of Hume that even geometry\\n\\n ― 343 ―\\n                            \\ncontains no necessary or universal elements, but is an°ac-count\\naccount of sensible appearances, relative, as are all matters of\\nsensation.\\nLocke\\'s ideas may be synopsized as follows: It is a\\nsufficient account of solidity to say that it is got by touch and\\nthat it arises from the resistance found in bodies to the\\nentrance of any other body. \"It is that which hinders the\\napproach of two bodies when they are moved towards one\\nanother.\" If not identical with matter, it is at all events its\\nmost essential property. \"This of all others seems the idea\\nmost intimately connected with and essential to body, so as\\nnowhere else to be found or imagined, but only in matter.\"\\nIt is, moreover, the source of the other properties of matter.\\n\"Upon the solidity of bodies depend their mutual impulse,\\nresistance, and protrusion.\" Solidity, again, \"is so°insepa-rable\\ninseparable an idea from body that upon that depends its filling of\\nspace, its contact, impulse, and communication of motion\\nupon impulse.\" It is to be distinguished, therefore, from\\nhardness, for hardness is relative and derived, various°bod-ies\\nbodies having various degrees of it; while solidity consists in\\nutter exclusion of other bodies from the space possessed by\\nany one, so that the hardest body has no more solidity than\\nthe softest.\\nThe close connection between solidity and matter\\nmakes it not only possible, but necessary, to distinguish\\nbetween matter and extension as against the Cartesians, who\\nhad identified them. In particular Locke notes three°differ-ences\\ndifferences between these notions. Extension includes neither°so-lidity\\nsolidity nor resistance; its parts are inseparable from one°an-other\\nanother both really and mentally, and are immovable; while\\nmatter has solidity, its parts are mutually separable, and may\\nbe moved in space. From this distinction between space and\\nmatter it follows, according to Locke, that there is such a\\nthing as a vacuum, or that space is not necessarily a plenum\\nof matter. Matter is that which fills space; but it is entirely\\nindifferent to space whether or not it is filled. Space is\\noccupied by matter, but there is no essential relation°be-tween\\nbetween them. Solidity is the essence of matter; emptiness is\\nthe characteristic of space. \"The idea of space is as distinct\\nfrom that of solidity as it is from that of scarlet color. It is\\n\\n ― 344 ―\\n                            \\ntrue, solidity cannot exist without extension, neither can\\nscarlet color exist without extension; but this hinders not\\nthat they are distinct ideas.\"\\nThus there is fixed for us the idea of space as well as of\\nmatter. It is a distinct idea; that is, absolute or independent\\nin itself, having no intrinsic connection with phenomena in\\nspace. Yet it is got through the senses. How that can be a\\nmatter of sensation which is not only not material, but has\\nno connection in itself with matter, Locke does not explain.\\nHe thinks it sufficient to say that we see distance between\\nbodies of different color just as plainly as we see the colors.\\nSpace is, therefore, a purely immediate idea, containing no\\nmore organic relation to intelligence than it has to objects.\\nWe get the notion of time as we do that of space, excepting\\nthat it is the observation of internal states and not of external\\nobjects which furnishes the material of the idea. Time has\\ntwo elements,—succession and duration. \"Observing what\\npasses in the mind, how of our ideas there in train some\\nconstantly vanish, and others begin to appear, we come by\\nthe idea of succession, and by observing a distance in the\\nparts of this succession we get the idea of duration.\"\\nWhether, however, time is something essentially empty,\\nhaving no relation to the events which fill it, as space is\\nessentially empty, without necessary connection with the\\nobjects which fill it, is a question Locke does not consider. In\\nfact, the gist of his ideas upon this point is as follows: there\\nis actually an objective space or pure emptiness; employing\\nour senses, we get the idea of this space. There is actually an\\nobjective time; employing reflection, we perceive it. There is\\nnot the slightest attempt to form a philosophy of them, or to\\nshow their function in the construction of an intelligible\\nworld, except in the one point of the absolute independence\\nof matter and space.\\nIt cannot be said that Leibniz criticises the minor\\npoints of Locke in such a way as to throw much light upon\\nthem, or that he very fully expresses his own ideas about\\nthem. He contents himself with declaring that while the\\nsenses may give instances of space, time, and matter, and\\nmay suggest to intelligence the stimuli upon which°intelli-gence\\nintelligence realizes these notions from itself, they cannot be the\\n\\n ― 345 ―\\n                            \\nsource of these notions themselves; finding the evidence of\\nthis in the sciences of geometry, arithmetic, and pure°phys-ics\\nphysics. For these sciences deal with the notions of space, time,\\nand matter, giving necessary and demonstrative ideas°con-cerning\\nconcerning them, which the senses can never legitimate. He\\nfurther denies the supposed absoluteness or independence of\\nspace, matter, and motion. Admitting, indeed, the°distinc-tion\\ndistinction between extension and matter, he denies that this°dis-tinction\\ndistinction suffices to prove the existence, or even the°possibil-ity\\npossibility, of a vacuum, and ends with a general reference to his\\ndoctrine of pre-established harmony, as serving to explain\\nthese matters more fully and more accurately.\\nLeibniz has, however, a complete philosophy of nature.\\nIn his other writing, he explains the ideas of matter and\\nforce in their dependence upon his metaphysic, or doctrine\\nof spiritual entelechies. The task does not at first sight\\nappear an easy one. The reality, according to Leibniz, is\\npurely spiritual, does not exist in space nor time, and is a\\nprinciple of activity following its own law,—that of°reflect-ing\\nreflecting the universe of spiritual relations. How from this world\\nof ideal, unextended, and non-temporal dynamic realities we\\nare to pass over to a material world of extension, with its\\nstatic existence in space, and transitory passage in time, is a\\nquestion challenging the whole Leibnizian system. It is a\\nquestion, however, for which Leibniz himself has provided\\nan answer. We may not regard it as adequate; we may think\\nthat he has not truly derived the material world from his\\nspiritual principles: but at all events he asked himself the\\nquestion, and gave an answer. We shall investigate this\\nanswer by arranging what Leibniz has said under the heads\\nof: matter as a metaphysical principle; matter as a physical\\nphenomenon; and the relation of phenomena to absolute\\nreality, or of the physical to the metaphysical. In connection\\nwith the second head, particularly, we shall find it necessary\\nto discuss what Leibniz has said about space, time, and\\nmotion.\\nWolff, who put the ideas of Leibniz into systematic\\nshape, did it at the expense of almost all their significance.\\nHe took away the air of paradox, of remoteness, that°charac-terized\\ncharacterized Leibniz\\'s thought, and gave it a popular form. But\\n\\n ― 346 ―\\n                            \\nits depth and suggestiveness vanished in the process.°Unfor-tunately\\nUnfortunately, Wolff\\'s presentations of the philosophy of Leibniz\\nhave been followed by others, to whom it seemed a dull task\\nto follow out the intricacies of a thought nowhere°systemati-cally\\nsystematically expressed. This has been especially the case as°con-cerns\\nconcerns the Leibnizian doctrine of matter. A superficial°inter-pretation\\ninterpretation of certain passages in Leibniz has led to an almost\\nuniversal misunderstanding about it. Leibniz frequently\\nsays that since matter is composite or complex, it follows\\nthat there must be something simple as its basis, and this\\nsimple something is the monad. The misinterpretation just\\nspoken of consists in supposing that Leibniz meant that\\nmatter as composite is made up of monads as simple; that\\nthe monad and matter are facts of the same order, the latter\\nbeing only an aggregate, or continued collection of the°for-mer\\nformer. It interpreted the conception of Leibniz in strict°anal-ogy\\nanalogy with the atomic theory of Lucretius, excepting that it\\ngranted that the former taught that the ultimate atom, the\\ncomponent of all complex forms of matter, has position only,\\nnot extension, its essence consisting in its exercise of force,\\nnot in its mere space occupancy. The monad was thus°con-sidered\\nconsidered to be in space, or at least conditioned by space\\nrelations, as is a mathematical point, although not itself\\nspatial in the sense of being extended. Monad and matter\\nwere thus represented as facts of the same kind or genus,\\nhaving their difference only in their relative isolation or\\naggregation.\\nBut Leibniz repudiated this idea, and that not only by\\nthe spirit of his teaching, but in express words. Monads \"are\\nnot ingredients or constituents of matter,\" he says, \"but\\nonly conditions of it.\" \"Monads can no more be said to be\\nparts of bodies, or to come in contact with them, or to\\ncompose them, than can souls or mathematical points.\"\\n\"Monads per se have no situation relative to one another.\"\\nAn increase in the number of created monads, he says again,\\nif such a thing could be supposed, would no more increase\\nthe amount of matter in existence, than mathematical points\\nadded to a line would increase its length. And again:\\n\"There is no nearness or remoteness among monads; to say\\nthat they are gathered in a point or are scattered in space, is\\n\\n ― 347 ―\\n                            \\nto employ mental fictions, in trying to imagine what can only\\nbe thought.\" The italicized words give the clew to the whole\\ndiscussion. To make monads of the same order as corporeal\\nphenomena, is to make them sensible, or capable of being\\nimaged, or conditioned by space and time,—three phrases\\nwhich are strictly correlative. But the monads can only be\\nthought,—that is, their qualities are ideal, not sensible; they\\ncan be realized only by reason, not projected in forms°hav-ing\\nhaving spatial outline and temporal habitation, that is, in°im-ages\\nimages. Monads and material things, in other words, are facts\\nof two distinct orders; they are related as the rational or\\nspiritual and the physical or sensible. Matter is no more\\ncomposed of monads than it is of thoughts or of logical\\nprinciples. As Leibniz says over and over again: Matter,\\nspace, time, motion are only phenomena, although°phenom-ena\\nphenomena bene fundata,—phenomena, that is, having their°ra-tional\\nrational basis and condition. The monads, on the other hand,\\nare not appearances, they are realities.\\nHaving freed our minds from the supposition that it is\\nin any way possible to form an image or picture of the\\nmonad; having realized that it is wholly false to suppose that\\nmonads occupy position in space, and then by their°continu-ity\\ncontinuity fill it, and make extended matter,—we must attempt to\\nframe a correct theory of the nature of matter and its°rela-tion\\nrelation to the monad. We shall do this only as we realize that\\n\"matter,\" so far as it has any reality, or so far as it has any\\nreal fundamentum, must be something ideal, or, in Leibniz\\'s\\nlanguage, \"metaphysical.\" As he says over and over again,\\nthe only realities are the substances or spiritual units of\\nactivity, to which the name \"monad\" is given. In the°in-quiry\\ninquiry, then, after such reality as matter may have, we must\\nbetake ourselves to this unit of living energy.\\nAlthough every monad is active, it is not entirely°ac-tive\\nactive. There is, as we have already seen, an infinite scale of\\nsubstances; and since substance is equivalent to activity, this\\nis saying that there is an infinite scale of activities. God\\nalone is purus actus, absolute energy, untouched by°passiv-ity\\npassivity or receptivity. Every other being has the element of\\nincompleteness, of inadequacy; it does not completely°repre-sent\\nrepresent the universe. In this passivity consists its finitude, so\\n\\n ― 348 ―\\n                            \\nthat Leibniz says that not even God himself could deprive\\nmonads of it, for this would be to make them equal to\\nhimself. In this passivity, incompleteness, or finitude,°con-sists\\nconsists what we call matter. Leibniz says that he can°under-stand\\nunderstand what Plato meant when he called matter something\\nessentially imperfect and transitory. Every finite monad is a\\nunion of two principles,—those of activity and of passivity.\\n\"I do not admit,\" says Leibniz, \"that there are souls°exist-ing\\nexisting simply by themselves, or that there are created spirits\\ndetached from all body. God alone is above all matter, since\\nhe is its author; creatures freed from matter would be at the\\nsame time detached from the universal connection of things,\\nand, as it were, deserters from the general order.\" And\\nagain, \"Beings have a nature which is both active and\\npassive; that is, material and immaterial.\" And again, he\\nsays that every created monad requires both an entelechy, or\\nprinciple of activity, and matter. \"Matter is essential to any\\nentelechy, and can never be separated from it, since matter\\ncompletes it.\" In short, the term \"monad\" is equivalent to\\nthe term \"entelechy\" only when applied to God. In every\\nother monad, the entelechy, or energy, is but one factor.\\n\"Matter, or primitive passive power, completes the°entele-chy\\nentelechy, or primitive active power, so that it becomes a perfect\\nsubstance, or monad.\" On the other hand, of course, matter,\\nas the passive principle, is a mere potentiality or abstraction,\\nconsidered in itself. It is real only in its union with the active\\nprinciple. Matter, he says, \"cannot exist without immaterial\\nsubstances.\" \"To every particular portion of matter belongs\\na particular form; that is, a soul, a spirit.\" To this element\\nof matter, considered as an abstraction, in its distinction\\nfrom soul, Leibniz, following the Scholastics, and ultimately\\nAristotle, gives the name, \"first\" or \"bare\" matter. The\\nsame influence is seen in the fact that he opposes this°ele-ment\\nelement of matter to \"form,\" or the active principle.\\nOur starting-point, therefore, for the consideration of\\nmatter is the statement that it is receptivity, the capacity for\\nbeing affected, which always constitutes matter. But what is\\nmeant by \"receptivity\"? To answer this question we must\\nreturn to what was said about the two activities of the\\nmonad,—representation, or perception, and appetition,—and\\n\\n ― 349 ―\\n                            \\nto the difference between confused and distinct ideas. The\\nmonad has appetition so far as it determines itself from\\nwithin to change, so far as it follows an internal principle of\\nenergy. It is representative so far as it is determined from\\nwithout, so far as it receives impressions from the universe.\\nYet we have learned to know that in one sense everything\\noccurs from the spontaneity of the monad itself; it receives\\nno influence or influxus from without; everything comes\\nfrom its own depths, or is appetition. But, on the other hand,\\nall that which so comes forth is only a mirroring or copying\\nof the universe. The whole content of the appetition is°repre-sentation\\nrepresentation. Although the monad works spontaneously, it is\\nnone the less determined in its activities to produce only\\nreflections or images of the world. In this way appetition and\\nrepresentation appear to be identical. The monad is°deter-mined\\ndetermined from within, indeed, but it is determined to exactly\\nthe same results as if wholly determined from without.\\nWhat light, then, can be thrown from this distinction upon\\nthe nature of matter?\\nNone, unless we follow Leibniz somewhat farther. If\\nwe do, we shall see that the soul is regarded as appetitive, or\\nself-active, so far as it has clear and distinct ideas. If the\\nmonad reaches distinct consciousness, it has knowledge of\\nself,—that is, of the nature of pure spirit,—or, what again is\\nequivalent to this, of the nature of reality as it universally is.\\nSuch knowledge is knowledge of God, of substance, of\\nunity, of pure activity, and of all the innate ideas which\\nelevate the confused perceptions of sense into science.°Dis-tinct\\nDistinct consciousness is therefore equivalent to self-activity,\\nand this to recognition of God and the universal. But if\\nknowledge is confused, it is not possible to see it in its\\nrelations to self; it cannot be analyzed; the rational or ideal\\nelement in it is concealed from view. In confused ideas,\\ntherefore, the soul appears to be passive; being passive, to be\\ndetermined from without. This determination from without\\nis equivalent to that which is opposed to spirit or reason, and\\nhence appears as matter. Such is in outline the Leibnizian\\nphilosophy.\\nIt thus is clear that merely stating that matter is°passiv-ity\\npassivity in the monad is not the ultimate way of stating its\\n\\n ― 350 ―\\n                            \\nnature. For passivity means in reality nothing but confused\\nrepresentations,—representations, that is, whose significance\\nis not perceived. The true significance of every°representa-tion\\nrepresentation is found in its relation to the ego, or pure self-activity,\\nwhich, through its dependent relation upon God, the°abso-lute\\nabsolute self-activity and ego, produces the representation from\\nits own ideal being. So far as the soul does not have distinct\\nrecognition of relation of all representations to self, it feels\\nthem as coming from without; as foreign to spirit; in short,\\nas matter. Leibniz thus employs exactly the same language\\nabout confused ideas that he does about passivity, or matter.\\nIt is not possible that the monad should have distinct°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness of itself as a mirror of the whole universe, he\\nsays, \"for in that case every entelechy would be God.\"\\nAgain, \"the soul would be God if it could enter at once and\\nwith distinctness into everything occurring within it.\" But it\\nis necessary \"that we should have passions which consist in\\nconfused ideas, in which there is something involuntary and\\nunknown, and which represent the body and constitute our\\nimperfection.\" Again, he speaks of matter as \"the mixture\\n(mélange) of the effects of the infinite environing us.\" In that\\nexpression is summed up his whole theory of matter. It is a\\nmixture; it is, that is to say, confused, aggregated,°irresolva-ble\\nirresolvable into simple ideas. But it is a mixture of \"effects of the\\ninfinite about us\"; that is, it takes its rise in the true, the\\nreal, the spiritual. It only fails to represent this as it actually\\nis. Matter, in short, is a phenomenon dependent upon°inabil-ity\\ninability to realize the entire spiritual character of reality. It is\\nspirit apprehended in a confused, hesitating, and passive\\nmanner.\\nIt is none the less a necessary phenomenon, for it is\\ninvolved in the idea of a continuous gradation of monads, in\\nthe distinction between the infinite and the finite, or, as\\nLeibniz often prefers to put it, between the \"creator\" and\\nthe \"created.\" There is involved everywhere in the idea of\\nLeibniz the conception of subordination; of a hierarchy of\\nforms, each of which receives the law of its action from the\\nnext higher, and gives the law to the next lower. We have\\npreviously considered the element of passivity or receptivity\\nas relating only to the monad which manifests it. It is\\n\\n ― 351 ―\\n                            \\nevident, however, that what is passive in one, implies°some-thing\\nsomething active in another. What one receives, is what another\\ngives. The reciprocal influence of monads upon one another,\\ntherefore, as harmonious members of one system, requires\\nmatter. More strictly speaking, this reciprocal influence is\\nmatter. To take away all receptivity, all passivity, from\\nmonads would be to isolate them from all relations with\\nothers; it would be to deprive them of all power of affecting\\nor being affected by others. That is what Leibniz meant by\\nthe expression already quoted, that if monads had not matter\\nas an element in them, \"they would be, as it were, deserters\\nfrom the general order.\" The note of unity, of organic\\nconnection, which we found to be the essence of the°Leib-nizian\\nLeibnizian philosophy, absolutely requires, therefore, matter, or\\npassivity.\\nIt must be remembered that this reciprocal influence is\\nideal. As Leibniz remarks, \"When it is said that one monad\\nis affected by another, this is to be understood concerning its\\nrepresentation of the other. For the Author of things has so\\naccommodated them to one another that one is said to suffer\\n(or receive from the other) when its relative value gives\\nway to that of the other.\" Or again, \"the modifications of\\none monad are the ideal causes of the modifications of°an-other\\nanother monad, so far as there appear in one the reasons on\\naccount of which God brought about in the beginning°cer-tain\\ncertain modifications in another.\" And most definitely of all:\\n\"A creature is called active so far as it has perfection;\\npassive in so far as it is imperfect. One creature is more\\nperfect than another so far as there is found in it that which\\nserves to render the reason, a priori, for that occurring in the\\nother; and it is in this way that it acts upon the other.\"\\nWe are thus introduced, from a new point of view and\\nin a more concrete way, to the conception of pre-established\\nharmony. The activity of one, the energy which gives the\\nlaw to the other and makes it subordinate in the hierarchy of\\nmonads, is conceived necessarily as spirit, as soul; that\\nwhich receives, which is rendered subordinate by the°activ-ity\\nactivity of the other, is body. The pre-established harmony is the\\nfact that they are so related that one can receive the law of\\nits activity from the other. Leibniz is without doubt partially\\n\\n ― 352 ―\\n                            \\nresponsible for the ordinary misconception of his views upon\\nthis point by reason of the illustration which he was°accus-tomed\\naccustomed to use; namely, of two clocks so constructed that\\nwithout any subsequent regulation each always kept perfect\\ntime with the other,—as much so as if there were some\\nactual physical connection between them. This seems to put\\nsoul and body, spirit and matter, as two co-ordinate°sub-stances\\nsubstances, on the same level, with such natural opposition°be-tween\\nbetween them that some external harmony must arrange some\\nunity of action. In causing this common idea of his theory of\\npre-established harmony, Leibniz has paid the penalty for\\nattempting to do what he often reproves in°others,—imagin-ing\\nothers,—imagining or presenting in sensible form what can only be thought.\\nBut his other explanations show clearly enough that the\\npre-established harmony expresses, not a relation between\\ntwo parallel substances, but a condition of dependence of\\nlower forms of activity upon the higher for the law of their\\nexistence and activity,—in modern terms, it expresses the\\nfact that phenomena are conditioned upon noumena; that\\nmaterial facts get their significance and share of reality\\nthrough their relation to spirit.\\nWe may sum up what has been said about matter as an\\nelement in the monad, or as a metaphysical principle, as\\nfollows: The existence of matter is not only not opposed to\\nthe fundamental ideas of Leibniz, but is a necessary°deduc-tion\\ndeduction from them. It is a necessity of the principle of°continu-ity\\ncontinuity; for this requires an infinity of monads, alike indeed in\\nthe universal law of their being, but unlike, each to each, in\\nthe specific coloring or manifestation of this law. The°princi-ple\\nprinciple of organic unity requires that there be as many real\\nbeings as possible participating in and contributing to it. It\\nis necessary, again, in order that there may be reciprocal\\ninfluence or connection among the monads. Were it not for\\nthe material element in the monad, each would be a God; if\\neach were thus infinite and absolute, there would be so many\\nprinciples wholly independent and isolated. The principle of\\nharmony would be violated. So much for the necessity of the\\nmaterial factor. As to its nature, it is a principle of passivity;\\nthat is, of ideal receptivity, of conformity to a law°appar-ently\\napparently not self-imposed, but externally laid down. This makes\\n\\n ― 353 ―\\n                            \\nmatter equivalent to a phenomenon; that is to say, to the\\nhaving of confused, imperfect, inadequate ideas. To say that\\nmatter is correlative to confused ideas is to say that there is\\nno recognition of its relation to self or to spirit. As Leibniz\\nsometimes puts it, since there is an infinity of beings in the\\nuniverse, each one of which exercises an ideal influence upon\\nevery other one of the series, it is impossible that this other\\none should realize their full meaning; they appear only as\\nconfused ideas, or as matter. To use language which Leibniz\\nindeed does not employ, but which seems to convey his\\nthought, the spirit, not seeing them as they really are, does\\nnot find itself in them. But matter is thus not only the\\nconfused manifestation or phenomenon of spirit, it is also its\\npotentiality. Passivity is always relative. It does not mean\\ncomplete lack of activity; that, as Leibniz says, is°nothing-ness\\nnothingness, and matter is not a form of nothingness. Leibniz even\\nspeaks of it as passive power. That is to say, there is an\\nundeveloped or incomplete activity in what appears as°mat-ter\\nmatter, and this may be,—if we admit an infinity of time,—must\\nbe developed. When developed it manifests itself as it really\\nis, as spirit. Confused ideas, as Leibniz takes pains to state,\\nare not a genus of ideas antithetical to distinct; they differ\\nonly in degree or grade. They are on their way to become\\ndistinct, or else they are distinct ideas which have fallen\\nback into an \"involved\" state of being. Matter, therefore, is\\nnot absolutely opposed to spirit,—on the one hand because it\\nis the manifestation, the phenomenon, of spirit; on the other,\\nbecause it is the potentiality of spirit, capable of sometime\\nrealizing the whole activity implied in it, but now latent.\\nThus it is that Leibniz says that everything is \"full\" of\\nsouls or monads. What appears to be lifeless is in reality like\\na pond full of fishes, like a drop of water full of infusoria.\\nEverything is organic down to the last element. More truly,\\nthere is no last element. There is a true infinity of organic\\nbeings wrapped up in the slightest speck of apparently°life-less\\nlifeless matter. These illustrations, like many others which\\nLeibniz uses, are apt to suggest that erroneous conception of\\nthe relation of monads to spirit which we were obliged, in\\nLeibniz\\'s name, to correct at the outset,—the idea, namely,\\nthat matter is composed, in a spatial or mechanical way, of\\n\\n ― 354 ―\\n                            \\nmonads. But after the foregoing explanations we can see\\nthat what Leibniz means when he says that every portion of\\nmatter is full of entelechies or souls, like a garden full of\\nplants, is that there is an absolute continuity of spiritual\\nprinciples, each having its ideal relation with every other.\\nThere is no point of matter which does not represent in a\\nconfused way the entire universe. It is therefore as infinite\\nin its activities as the universe. In idea also it is capable of\\nrepresenting in distinct consciousness, or as a development\\nof its own self-activity, each of these infinite activities.\\nIn a word, every created or finite being may be°re-garded\\nregarded as matter or as spirit, according as it is accounted for\\nby its external relations, as the reasons for what happens in\\nit are to be found elsewhere than in its own explicit activity,\\nor according as it shows clearly in itself the reasons for its\\nown modifications, and also accounts for changes occurring\\nin other beings. The externally conditioned is matter; the\\ninternally conditioned, the self-explanatory, is self-active, or\\nspirit. Since all external relations are finally dependent on\\norganic; since the ultimate source of all explanation must be\\nthat which is its own reason; since the ultimate source of all\\nactivity must be that which is self-active,—the final reason or\\nsource of matter is spirit.\\n\\n ― 355 ―\\n                            \\n8: Material Phenomena and Their RealityWe have seen the necessity and nature of matter as°deduc-tions\\ndeductions from the fundamental principles of Leibniz. We have\\nseen that matter is a phenomenon or manifestation of spirit\\nin an imperfect and confused way. But why should it appear\\nas moving, as extended, as resisting, as having cohesion,\\nwith all the concrete qualities which always mark it? Is there\\nany connection between these particular properties of matter\\nas physical, and its \"metaphysical\" or ideal character?\\nThese are the questions which now occupy us. Stated more\\ndefinitely, they take the following form: Is there any°essen-tial\\nessential connection between the properties of matter as a°meta-physical\\nmetaphysical element, and its properties as a sensible fact of\\nexperience? Leibniz holds that there is. He does not, indeed,\\nexplicitly take the ground that we can deduce a priori all the\\ncharacteristics of matter as a fact of actual experience from\\nits rational notion, but he thinks we can find a certain\\nanalogy between the two, that the sensible qualities are\\nimages or reflexes of the spiritual qualities, witnessing, so\\nfar as possible, to their origin in pure energy.\\nHis position is as follows: that which in the monad is\\nactivity or substantial, is, in sensible matter, motion. That\\nwhich in the monad is lack of a given activity, that which\\nconstitutes its subordinate position in the hierarchy of°mo-nads\\nmonads, is, in the sphere of material things, inertia. That which\\nin the spiritual world is the individuality of monads, making\\neach forever ideally distinct from every other, is, in the\\nphenomenal realm, resistance or impenetrability. The°per-fect\\nperfect continuity of monads in the mundus intelligibilis has\\n\\n ― 356 ―\\n                            \\nalso its counterpart in the mundus sensibilis in the diffusion\\nor extension of physical things.\\nInstead of following out this analogy directly, it will\\nrather be found convenient to take up Leibniz\\'s thought in\\nits historical connection. We have already alluded to the fact\\nthat he began as a Cartesian, and that one of the first ideas\\nwhich repelled him from that system of thought was the\\nnotion that the essence of matter is extension. His earliest\\nphilosophical writings, as he was gradually coming to the\\nthoughts which thereafter dominated him, are upon this\\npoint. In general, his conclusions are as follows: If matter\\nwere extension, it would be incapable of passion or of action.\\nSolidity, too, is a notion entirely opposed to the conception of\\nmere extension. The idea of matter as extension contradicts\\nsome of the known laws of motion. It requires that the\\nquantity of motion remain unchanged whenever two bodies\\ncome in contact, while as matter of fact it is the quantity of\\nenergy, that which the motion is capable of effecting, that\\nremains unchanged; or, as he more often puts the objection,\\nthe Cartesian notion of matter requires that matter be\\nwholly indifferent to motion, that there be nothing in it\\nwhich resists motion when imparted. But, says Leibniz,\\nthere is something resisting, that to which Kepler gave the\\nname \"inertia.\" It is not found to be true if one body\\nimpacts upon another that the second moves without°dimin-ishing\\ndiminishing the velocity or changing the direction of the first. On\\nthe other hand, just in proportion to the size of the second\\nbody, it resists and changes the motion of the first, up to the\\npoint of causing the first to rebound if small in comparison.\\nAnd when it was replied that the retardation was due to the\\nfact that the force moving the first body had now to be\\ndivided between two, Leibniz answered that this was simply\\nto give up the contention, and besides the notion of extension\\nto use that of force. If extension were the essence of matter,\\nit should be possible to deduce all the properties of matter,\\nor at least to account for them all, from it. But since, as just\\nseen, this does not enable us to account for any of them,\\nsince for any of its concrete qualities we have to fall back on\\nforce, it is evident where the true essence of matter is to be\\nfound.\\n\\n ― 357 ―\\n                            \\nLeibniz has another argument of a logical nature, as\\nthose already referred to are of a physical: \"Those who\\nclaim that extension is a substance, reverse the order of\\nwords as well as of thoughts. Besides extension there must\\nbe a subject which is extended; that is to say, something to\\nwhich it belongs to be repeated or continued. For extension\\nis nothing but a repetition or continued multiplication of that\\nwhich is spread out,—it is a plurality, a continuity, a°co-ex-istence\\nco-existence of parts. Consequently, extension does not suffice to\\nexplain the nature of the repeated or manifold substance, of\\nwhich the notion is anterior to that of its repetition.\"°Exten-sion\\nExtension, in other words, is nothing substantial, it is not°some-thing\\nsomething which can exist by itself; it is only a quality, a°prop-erty\\nproperty, a mode of being. It is always relative to something\\nwhich has extension. As Leibniz says elsewhere: \"I insist\\nthat extension is only an abstraction, and requires something\\nwhich is extended. It presupposes some quality, some°attri-bute\\nattribute, some nature in a subject which is extended, diffused, or\\ncontinued. Extension is a diffusion of this quality. For°exam-ple\\nexample, in milk there is an extension or diffusion of whiteness; in\\nthe diamond an extension or diffusion of hardness; in body in\\ngeneral a diffusion of antitypia or materiality. There is°ac-cordingly\\naccordingly in body something anterior to extension.\"\\nFrom the physical side, therefore, we find it impossible\\nto account for the concrete properties of material phenomena\\nfrom extension; on the logical we find that the idea of°exten-sion\\nextension is always relative to that which is extended. What is\\nthat which is to be considered as the bearer of extension and\\nthe source of physical qualities? We are led back to the point\\nat which we left the matter in the last chapter. It is force,\\nand force both passive and active. Leibniz uses the term\\n\"matter\" in at least three senses: it is the metaphysical\\nelement of passive force in the monad; it is the monad itself\\nconsidered as, upon the whole, externally conditioned or\\nunconscious; and it is the phenomenon resulting from the\\naggregation of the monads in the second sense. The first is\\nnaked matter, and is a pure abstraction; the second is the\\nmonad as material, as opposed to the monad, as soul; the\\nthird is clothed, or second matter, or, concretely, body,\\ncorpus. The first is unreal by itself; the second is one phase\\n\\n ― 358 ―\\n                            \\nof substance; the third is not substantial, but is a reality,\\nthough a phenomenal one. It is from the substantial monad\\nthat we are to explain the two things now demanding°ex-planation\\nexplanation,—that element in bodies (matter in third sense)\\nwhich is the source of their physical properties, and that\\nwhich is the subject, the carrier, so to speak, of extension.\\nThat of which we are in search as the source of the\\nphysical qualities of bodies is motion. This is not force, but\\nits \"image.\" It is force, says Leibniz, that \"is the real\\nelement in motion; that is to say, it is that element which out\\nof the present state induces a change in the future state.\" As\\nforce, in other words, is the causal activity which effects the\\ndevelopment of one \"representation\" of a monad out of\\nanother, so motion, in the realm of phenomena, is not only\\nchange, but change which is continuous and progressive,\\neach new position being dependent upon the foregoing, and\\nfollowing out of it absolutely without break.\\nMotion, therefore, is the manifestation of the ideal\\nunity of substance,—a unity not of mere static inherence, but\\nof a continuous process of activity. It is from this standpoint\\nthat Leibniz accounts for the so-called transference of°mo-tion\\nmotion from one body to another upon contact. The ordinary\\nview of this, which looks at it as if one body loses the motion\\nwhich another body gains, Leibniz ridicules, saying that\\nthose who hold this view seem to think that motion is a kind\\nof thing, resembling, perchance, salt dissolved in water. The\\nright view, on the other hand, does away with all appearance\\nof mystery in the carrying over of motion from one body to\\nanother, for it recognizes that continuity is the very essence\\nof motion, and that we do not have two things and a third\\nprocess, but that the two bodies are phases or elements in\\none and the same system of movement.\\nStarting from this idea of motion, then, Leibniz is to\\naccount for the actual qualities of matter as found in°experi-ence\\nexperience. These are the form, magnitude, cohesion, resistance,\\nand the purely sensible qualities of objects. \"First\" matter,\\nthat is, abstract matter, may be conceived, according to\\nLeibniz, as perfectly homogeneous, a \"subtle fluid,\" in his\\nwords, without any distinction of parts or of solidity. But\\nthis is an abstract notion. It is what matter would be without\\n\\n ― 359 ―\\n                            \\nmotion. Motion necessarily differentiates this plenum of\\nhomogeneity, and thus causes distinctions of figure (that is,\\nboundaries of parts) and varieties of cohesion, or the°vary-ing\\nvarying solidity and fluidity of bodies. The latter difference is\\nindeed the ultimate one. The principle of continuity or°gra-dation\\ngradation, as applied to motion, makes it necessary that motions\\nshould not be in any two places of exactly the same energy.\\nThe result is that the original fluid matter is everywhere\\ndifferently divided. Motion, entering into the uniform\\nplenum, introduces distinction; it causes so much of the\\nmatter as is affected by a given movement to collect together\\nand form in appearance a coherent body, as opposed to\\nsurrounding bodies which are affected by different degrees\\nof energy. But even this is only approximate; the same\\nprinciple of continuity must be applied within any°appar-ently\\napparently coherent body; its parts, while, in relation to other\\nbodies, they have the same amount of motion, are in relation\\nto one another differently affected. There are no two having\\nexactly the same motion; if they had, there would be no\\ndistinction between them; and thus, according to the°princi-ple\\nprinciple of Leibniz, they would be the same.\\nIt follows at once from this that there is in the universe\\nno body of absolute hardness or solidity, nor of entire°soft-ness\\nsoftness or fluidity. A perfectly solid body would be one whose\\nsystem of motions could not be affected by any other system,\\n-a body which by motion had separated itself from motion,\\nor become absolute. This is evidently an idea which°contra-dicts\\ncontradicts itself, for the very essence of motion is continuity or\\nrelation. A body perfectly fluid, on the other hand, would be\\none in which there was no resistance offered to other°mo-tions\\nmotions,—a body, in other words, in which there are no°move-ments\\nmovements that, entering into connection with one another, form\\na relative opposition to other movements. It would be a body\\nisolated or out of relation with the general system of°mo-tions\\nmotions, and hence an impossibility. There is no last term either\\nof solidity or of fluidity.\\nIt equally follows as matter of course that there is no\\nindivisible particle of matter,—no atom. The infinity of°de-grees\\ndegrees of motion implies a corresponding division of matter.\\nAs already said, it is only in contrast with other relatively\\n\\n ― 360 ―\\n                            \\nconstant systems of motion that any body is of uniform\\nmotion; in reality there is everywhere throughout it variety\\nof movement, and hence complete divisibility, or rather,\\ncomplete division. If Leibniz were to employ the term\\n\"atom\" at all, it could be only in the sense of the modern\\ndynamical theory (of which, indeed, he is one of the°origina-tors\\noriginators), according to which the atom is not defined by its\\nspatial position and outlines, but, by the range of its effects,\\nas the centre of energies of infinite circumference.°Correla-tive\\nCorrelative to the non-existence of the atom is the non-existence of\\nthe vacuum. The two imply each other. The hard, limited,\\nisolated body, having no intrinsic relations with other°bod-ies\\nbodies, must have room to come into external relations with\\nthem. This empty space, which is the theatre of such°acci-dental\\naccidental contacts as may happen, is the vacuum. But if bodies\\nare originally in connection with one another, if they are in\\nreality but differentiations of varying degrees of motion\\nwithin one system of motion, then there is no necessity for\\nthe vacuum,—nay, there is no place for it. The vacuum in\\nthis case could mean only a break, a chasm, in the order of\\nnature. According to the theory of Leibniz, \"bodies\" are but\\nthe dynamic divisions of the one energy that fills the°uni-verse\\nuniverse; their separateness is not an independent possession of\\nany one of them or of all together, but is the result of\\nrelations to the entire system. Their apparent isolation is\\nonly by reason of their actual connections. To admit a°vac-uum\\nvacuum anywhere, would thus be to deny the relatedness of the\\nparts separated by it. The theory of the atom and the°vac-uum\\nvacuum are the two phases of the metaphysical assumption of\\nan indefinite plurality of independent separate realities. The\\ntheory of Leibniz, resting as it does on the idea of a perfect\\nunity of inter-related members, must deny both of these\\naspects. Were we making an extended analysis of the°op-posed\\nopposed view, it would be necessary to point out that it denies\\nitself. For it is only through the vacuum that the atoms are\\nisolated or independent, and the sole function of the vacuum\\nis to serve as the background of the atoms. The atoms, are\\nseparated only in virtue of their connection, and the vacuum\\nis what it is-pure emptiness—only on account of that which\\nis in it. In short, the theory is only an abstract and°incom-plete\\n ― 361 ―\\n                            \\nincomplete way of grasping the thought of relation or mediated\\nunity.\\nWe have thus discovered that all motions conspire\\ntogether, or form a system. But in their unity they do not\\ncease to be motions, or variously differentiated members.\\nThrough this differentiation, or mutual reaction of motions,\\nthere comes about the appearance of boundaries, of°separa-tion\\nseparation. From these boundaries or terminations arise the form\\nand size of bodies. From motion also proceeds the cohesion\\nof bodies, in the sense that each relative system resists\\ndissolution, or hangs together. Says Leibniz, \"The motions,\\nsince they are conspiring, would be troubled by separation;\\nand accordingly this can be accomplished only by violence\\nand with resistance.\" Not only form, size, and stability\\ndepend upon motion, but also the sensible, the \"secondary\"\\nqualities. \"It must not be supposed that color, pain, sound,\\netc., are arbitrary and without relation to their causes. It is\\nnot God\\'s way to act with so little reason and order. There is\\na kind of resemblance, not entire, but of relation, of order.\\nWe say, for example, \\'Light is in the fire,\\' since there are\\nmotions in the fire which are imperceptible in their°separa-tion\\nseparation, but which are sensible in their conjunction or°confu-sion\\nconfusion; and this is what is made known in the idea of light.\" In\\nother words, color, sound, etc., even pain, are still the°per-ception\\nperception of motion, but in a confused way. We thus see how\\nthoroughly Leibniz carries back all the properties of bodies\\nto motion. To sum up, motion is the origin of the relative\\nsolidity, the divisibleness, the form, the size, the cohesion, or\\nactive resistance of bodies, and of their properties as made\\nknown to us in immediate sensation.\\nIn all that has been said it has been implied that\\nextension is already in existence; \"first matter\" is supposed\\nto fill all space, and motion to determine it to take upon itself\\nits actual concrete properties. But this \"first matter,\" when\\nthus spoken of, has a somewhat mythological sound, even if\\nit be admitted that it is an abstraction. For how can an\\nabstraction be extended in space, and how can it form, as it\\nwere, a background upon which motion displays itself? The\\nidea of \"first matter\" in its relation to extension evidently\\ndemands explanation. In seeking this explanation we shall\\n\\n ― 362 ―\\n                            \\nalso learn about that \"subject\" which Leibniz said was\\nnecessarily presupposed in extension, as a concrete thing is\\nrequired for a quality.\\nThe clew to the view of Leibniz upon this point may be\\nderived, I think, from the following quotations:—\\n\"If it were possible to see what makes extension, that\\nkind of extension which falls under our eyes at present\\nwould vanish, and our minds would perceive nothing else\\nthan simple realities existing in mutual externality to one\\nanother. It would be as if we could distinguish the minute\\nparticles of matter variously disposed from which a painted\\nimage is formed: if we could do it, the image, which is\\nnothing but a phenomenon, would vanish. . . . If we think\\nof two simple realities as both existing at the same time, but\\ndistinct from one another, we look at them as if they were\\noutside of one another, and hence conceive them as°ex-tended\\nextended.\"\\nThe monads are outside of one another, not spatially,\\nbut ideally; but this reciprocal distinction from one another,\\nif it is to appear in phenomenal mode, must take the form of\\nan image, and the image is spatial. But if the monads were\\npure activity, they would not take phenomenal form or°ap-pear\\nappear in an image. They would always be thought just as\\nthey are,—unextended activities realizing the spiritual°es-sence\\nessence of the universe. But they are not pure activity; they are\\npassive as well. It is in virtue of this passive element that the\\nideal externality takes upon itself phenomenal or sensible\\nform, and thus appears as spatial externality.\\nLeibniz, in a passage already quoted, refers to the\\ndiffusion of materiality or antitypia. This word, which is of\\nfrequent occurrence in the discussions of Leibniz, he°trans-lates\\ntranslates generally as \"impenetrability,\" sometimes as \"passive\\nresistance.\" It corresponds to the solidity or resistance of\\nwhich Locke spoke as forming the essence of matter.°Anti-typia\\nAntitypia is the representation by a monad of the passive element\\nin other monads. Leibniz sometimes speaks as if all created\\nmonads had in themselves antitypia, and hence extension;\\nbut he more accurately expresses it by saying that they need\\n(exigent) it. This is a technical term which he elsewhere\\nuses to express the relation of the possible to the actual. The\\n\\n ― 363 ―\\n                            \\npossible \"needs\" the actual, not in the sense that it°necessar-ily\\nnecessarily requires existence, but in the sense that when the actual\\ngives it existence, it is the logical basis of the actual,—the\\nactual, on the other hand, being its real complement. The\\npassivity of the monad is therefore at once the logical basis\\nand the possibility of the impenetrability of matter. It is\\nowing to the passivity of the monad that it does not°ade-quately\\nadequately reflect (that it is not transparent to, so to speak) the\\nactivities of other monads. In its irresponsiveness, it fails to\\nmirror them in itself. It may be said, therefore, to be°impen-etrable\\nimpenetrable to them. They in turn, so far as they are passive, are\\nimpenetrable to it. Now the impenetrable is, ex vi terminis,\\nthat which excludes, and that which excludes, not in virtue\\nof its active elasticity, but in virtue of its mere inertia, its\\ndead weight, as it were, of resistance. But mutual exclusion\\nof this passive sort constitutes that which is extended.°Ex-tension\\nExtension is the abstract quality of this concrete subject. Such,\\nin effect, is the deduction which Leibniz gives of body, or\\nphysical matter, from matter as metaphysical; of matter as\\nsensible or phenomenal, from matter as ideal or as°intelligi-ble\\nintelligible.\\nIf we put together what has been said, it is clear that\\nmaterial phenomena (bodies, corpora, in Leibniz\\'s phrase)\\nsimply repeat in another sphere the properties of the°spirit-ual\\nspiritual monad. There is a complete parallelism between every\\nproperty, each to each, and this necessarily; for every°prop-erty\\nproperty of \"body\" is in logical dependence upon, and a°phenom-enalization\\nphenomenalization of, some spiritual or ideal quality. Motion is\\nthe source of all the dynamic qualities of body, and motion is\\nthe reflection of Force, that force which is Life. But this\\nforce in all finite forms is conditioned by a passive,°unrecep-tive\\nunreceptive, unresponsive factor; and this must also have its°corre-late\\ncorrelate in \"body.\" This correlate is primarily impenetrability,\\nand secondarily extension. Thus it is that concrete body\\nalways manifests motion, indeed, but upon a background of\\nextension, and against inertia. It never has free play; had it\\nan unrestrained field of activity, extension would disappear,\\nand spatial motion would vanish into ideal energy. On the\\nother hand, were the essence of matter found in resistance or\\nimpenetrability, it would be wholly inert; it would be a\\n\\n ― 364 ―\\n                            \\nmonotone of extension, without variety of form or cohesion.\\nAs Leibniz puts it with reference to Locke, \"body\" implies\\nmotion, or impetuosity, resistance, and cohesion. Motion is\\nthe active principle, resistance the passive; while cohesion,\\nwith its various grades of completeness, which produce\\nform, size, and solidity, is the result of their union.\\nLeibniz, like Plato, has an intermediary between the\\nrational and the sensible; and as Plato found that it was\\nmathematical relations that mediate between the permanent\\nand unified Ideas and the changing manifold objects, so\\nLeibniz found that the relations of space and time form the\\nnatural transition from the sphere of monads to the world of\\nbodies. As Plato found that it was the possibility of applying\\nmathematical considerations to the world of images that\\nshowed the participation of Ideas in them, and constituted\\nsuch reality as they had, so Leibniz found that space and\\ntime formed the element of order and regularity among\\nsense-phenomena, and thus brought them into kinship with\\nthe monads and made them subjects of science. It is implied\\nin what is here said that Leibniz distinguished between\\nspace and time on the one hand, and duration and extension\\non the other. This distinction, which Leibniz draws°repeat-edly\\nrepeatedly and with great care, has been generally overlooked by\\nhis commentators. But it is evident that this leaves Leibniz\\nin a bad plight. Mathematics, in its various forms, is the\\nscience of spatial and temporal relations. But if these are\\nidentical with the forms of duration and extension, they are\\npurely phenomenal and sensible. The science of them,°ac-cording\\naccording to the Leibnizian distinction between the absolutely\\nreal and the phenomenally real, would be then a science of\\nthe confused, the imperfect, and the transitory; in fact, no\\nscience at all. But mathematics, on the contrary, is to°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz the type of demonstrative, conclusive science. Space and\\ntime are, in his own words, \"innate ideas,\" and the entire\\nscience of them is the drawing out of the content of these\\ninnate—that is, rational, distinct, and eternal ideas. But\\nextension and duration are sensible experiences; not rational,\\nbut phenomenal; not distinct, but confused; not eternal, but\\nevanescent. We may be sure that this contradiction would\\nnot escape Leibniz, although it has many of his critics and\\nhistorians.\\n\\n ― 365 ―\\n                            \\nIt is true, however, that he occasionally uses the terms\\nas synonymous; but this where the distinction between them\\nhas no bearing on the argument in hand, and where the\\ncontext determines in what sense the term is used. The\\ndistinction which he actually makes, and to which he keeps\\nwhen space and time are the subject of discussion, is that\\nextension and duration are qualities of predicates of objects\\nand events, while space and time are relations, or orders of\\nexistence. Extension and duration are, as he says, the°im-mensity\\nimmensity, the mass, the continuation, the repetition, of some\\nunderlying subject. But space and time are the measure of\\nthe mass, the rule or law of the continuation, the order or\\nmode of the repetition. Thus immediately after the passage\\nalready quoted, in which he says that extension in body is\\nthe diffusion of materiality, just as whiteness is the diffusion\\nof a property of milk, he goes on to say \"that extension is to\\nspace as duration to time. Duration and extension are°attri-butes\\nattributes of things; but space and time are to be considered, as it\\nwere, outside of things, and as serving to measure them.\"\\nStill more definitely he says: \"Many confound the°immen-sity\\nimmensity or extent of things with the space by means of which this\\nextent is defined. Space is not the extension of body, any\\nmore than duration is its time. Things keep their extension,\\nnot always their space. Everything has its own extent and\\nduration; but it does not have a time of its own, nor keep for\\nits own a space.\" Or, as he expresses the latter idea°else-where\\nelsewhere, space is like number, in the sense that it is indifferent\\nto spatial things, just as number is indifferent to res°numer-ata\\nnumerata. Just as the number five is not a quality or possession of\\nany object, or group of objects, but expresses an order or\\nrelation among them, so a given space is not the property of\\na thing, but expresses the order of its parts to one another.\\nBut extension, on the other hand, is a property of the given\\nobjects. While extension, therefore, must always belong to\\nsome actual thing, space, as a relation, is as applicable to\\npossible things as to actual existences; so that Leibniz°some-times\\nsometimes says that time and space \"express possibilities.\" They\\nare that which makes it possible for a definite and coherent\\norder of experiences to exist. They determine existence in\\nsome of its relations, and as such are logically prior to any\\ngiven forms of existence; while extent and duration are\\n\\n ― 366 ―\\n                            \\nalways qualities of some given form of existence, and hence\\nlogically derivative. Since time and space \"characterize°pos-sibilities\\npossibilities\" as well as actualities, it follows as a matter of\\ncourse \"that they are of the nature of eternal truths, which\\nrelate equally to the possible and to the existing.\" Being an\\neternal truth, space must have its place in that which is\\nsimply the active unity of all eternal truths,—the mind of\\nGod. \"Its truth and reality are based upon God. It is an\\norder whose source is God.\" Since God is purus actus, he is\\nthe immediate, the efficient source only of that which°par-takes\\npartakes in some degree of his own nature, or is rational; and\\nhere is another clear point of distinction between space and\\nextension, between time and duration.\\nBut we must ask more in detail regarding their nature.\\nAdmitting that they are relations, ideal and prior to°particu-lar\\nparticular experiences, the question must be asked, What sort of\\nrelations are they; how are they connected with the purely\\nspiritual on one hand, and with the phenomenal on the\\nother? Leibniz\\'s most extended answers to these questions\\nare given in his controversy with Clarke. The latter took\\nmuch the same position regarding the nature of space\\n(though not, indeed, concerning the origin of its idea) as\\nLocke, and the arguments which Leibniz uses against him\\nhe might also have used, for the most part, against Locke.\\nLocke and Clarke both conceived of space and time as\\nwholly without intrinsic relation to objects and events. It is\\nespecially against this position that Leibniz argues, holding\\nthat space and time are simply orders or relations of objects\\nand events, that space exists only where objects are existing,\\nand that it is the order of their co-existence, or of their\\npossible co-existence; while time exists only as events are\\noccurring, and is the relation of their succession. Clarke, on\\nthe other hand, speaks of the universe of objects as bounded\\nby and moving about in an empty space, and says that time\\nexisted before God created the finite world, so that the world\\ncame into a time already there to receive its on-goings, just\\nas it fell into a space already there to receive its°co-exist-ences\\nco-existences.\\nTo get at the ideas of Leibniz, therefore, we cannot do\\nbetter than follow the course of this discussion. He begins\\n\\n ― 367 ―\\n                            \\nby saying that both space and time are purely relative, one\\nbeing the order of co-existences, the other of successions.\\nSpace characterizes in terms of possibility an order of things\\nexisting at the same time, so far as they exist in mutual\\nrelations (ensemble), without regard to their special modes\\nof existence. As to the alternate doctrine that space is a\\nsubstance, or something absolute, it contradicts the principle\\nof sufficient reason. Were space something absolutely°uni-form\\nuniform, without things placed in it, there would be no°differ-ence\\ndifference between one part and another, and it would be a matter\\nof utter indifference to God why he gave bodies certain\\npositions in space rather than others; similarly it would be a\\nmatter of indifference why he created the world when he\\ndid, if time were something independent of events. In other\\nwords, the supposed absoluteness of space and time would\\nrender the action of God wholly without reason, capricious,\\nand at haphazard. Similarly, it contradicts the principle of\\n\"indiscernibles,\" by which Leibniz means the principle of\\nspecification, or distinction. According to him, to suppose\\ntwo things exactly alike, is simply to imagine the same thing\\ntwice. Absolute uniformity, wholly undifferentiated, is a\\nfiction impossible to realize in thought. \"Space considered\\nwithout objects has nothing in it to determine it; it is°accord-ingly\\naccordingly nothing actual. The parts of space must be determined\\nand distinguished by the objects which are in them.\"°Fi-nally\\nFinally, were space and time absolutely real things in°them-selves\\nthemselves, they would be independent of God, and even°limita-tions\\nlimitations upon him. \"They would be more substantial than\\nsubstances. God would not be able to change or destroy\\nthem. They would be immutable and eternal in every part.\\nThus there would be an infinity of eternal things (these\\nparts) independent of God.\" They would limit God because\\nhe would be obliged to exist in them. Only by existing\\nthrough this independent time would he be eternal; only by\\nextending through this independent space would he be°omni-present\\nomnipresent. Space and time thus become gods themselves.\\nWhen Clarke declares that by the absoluteness of\\nspace and time he does not mean that they are themselves\\nsubstances, but only properties, attributes of substance,\\nLeibniz advances the same arguments in different form. If\\n\\n ― 368 ―\\n                            \\nspace were the property of the things that are in space, it\\nwould belong now to one substance, now to another, and\\nwhen empty of all material substance, even to an immaterial\\nsubstance, perhaps to God. \"Truly a strange attribute\\nwhich is handed about from one thing to another.°Sub-stances\\nSubstances thus leave their accidents as if they were old clothes,\\nand other substances put them on.\" Since these finite spaces\\nare in infinite space, and the latter is an attribute of God, it\\nmust be that an attribute of God is composed of parts, some\\nof them empty, some full, some round, some square. So, too,\\nwhatever is in time would help make one of the attributes of\\nGod. \"Truly a strange God,\" says Leibniz, \"this Deity of\\nparts\" (ce Dieu à parties). Clarke\\'s reply to this was that\\nspace and time are attributes of God and of God alone, not\\nof things in space and time,—that, indeed, strictly speaking,\\nthere are no parts in space or in time; they are absolutely\\none. This was virtually to give up the whole matter. It was\\nto deny the existence of finite spaces and times, and to\\nresolve them into an indefinite attribute of God. Such a view,\\nas Leibniz points out, not only is contrary to experience, but\\naffords no aid in determining the actual concrete forms and\\nsituations of bodies, and durations and successions of events.\\nThe absolute space and time, having no parts, are wholly\\nout of relations to these concrete existences. The latter°re-quire\\nrequire, therefore, a space and a time that are relations or\\norders. Clarke\\'s hypothesis is, as Leibniz says, wholly°with-out\\nwithout use or function, and requires a theory like that of°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz to account for the actually determinate forms of°experi-ence\\nexperience. In his last reply Clarke shifts his ground again, and\\nsays that space and time are effects of God\\'s existence; \"they\\nare the necessary results of his existence.\" \"His existence is\\nthe cause of space and time.\" The death of Leibniz°pre-vented\\nprevented any further reply. It is not hard to imagine, however,\\nthat in a general way his reply would have been to ask how\\nspace and time are at once attributes essential and necessary\\nto God, as constituting his immensity and eternity, and\\neffects dependent upon his existence. To take this latter\\nposition, indeed, seems to abandon the position that they are\\nabsolute, and to admit that, like the rest of God\\'s creation,\\nthey are relative and finite.\\n\\n ― 369 ―\\n                            \\nSo much for Leibniz\\'s polemic. Its meaning is that\\nspace and time have significance only with reference to\\nthings and events, that they are the intellectual, the ideal\\nside of these objects and occurrences, being the relations\\nwhich give them order and unity. A space which is not the\\nspace of objects, which is not space in and through objects,\\nis an inanity; it is not spirit, it is not matter; it is not a\\nrelation of either. It is nothingness magnified to infinity, and\\nthen erected into existence. And all for nothing; for it does\\nnot enable us to account for a single concrete fact of°experi-ence\\nexperience. For this we must have recourse to relations and orders\\nof existence. Space is therefore to be defined as the order\\nwhich makes it possible for objects to have situation; time as\\nthat which makes it possible for events to have dating,—not\\nas if they were actually prior to them, and although nothings\\nin themselves, yet capable of giving concrete determination\\nto things, but as actually the relations themselves, and as\\nideally necessary for the coherent experience of co-existent\\nobjects and of connected events. As Leibniz puts it°epigram-matically\\nepigrammatically: \"Space is the order of possible constants; time the\\norder of inconstant possibilities.\"\\nWe have finished the exposition of the views of Leibniz\\nabout matter and material facts. One question, however,\\nremains to be discussed,—a question which Leibniz\\'s°con-temporary\\ncontemporary critics would not allow him to pass over in°si-lence\\nsilence, even had he been so disposed. What is the reality of\\nmatter, of motion, of space, and of time? Since they are, as\\nLeibniz says, only phenomena, not absolute realities, what\\ndistinguishes them from dreams, from illusions? What°dis-tinguishes\\ndistinguishes sensible phenomena from capricious fantasies,\\nand gives them reality?\\nLeibniz begins his answer by pointing out that the\\nmere fact that bodies are phenomena does not make them\\nunreal. To say that anything is phenomenal is to say that it\\nis sensible; but \"the senses make no declaration regarding\\nmetaphysical matters\" such as truth and reality. The senses,\\nin a word, only inform us that the experiences are there for\\nthe senses, that they are sensible. What is the ultimate\\nnature of the sensible or the phenomenal, what is their\\nreality, is a question wholly outside the province of sense.\\n\\n ― 370 ―\\n                            \\nThe questions of ultimate nature, of reality, are questions of\\nmetaphysics, and hence are to be decided by the reason, not\\nby the senses. And Leibniz goes on to say that the°truthful-ness\\ntruthfulness of the senses, since it concerns only the sensible,°con-sists\\nconsists in the reciprocal agreement of sensible facts, and in\\nthat we are not deceived in reasoning from one to another.\\nAn isolated sense-experience could not be said to be either\\ntrue or false, real or illusory. It would be true that it was\\nexperienced, and that is all that could be said about it. But\\nsince our experiences are not thus separated, but have a\\ncertain order, there arises what we may call sensible reality\\nand illusion. When the order between two facts remains the\\nsame \"in different times and places and in the experience of\\ndifferent men,\" we call these facts real. If, however, our\\nexperience cannot be repeated by ourselves or by other men\\nwhen the same conditions (that is, connections) are present,\\nit is unreal, or false. It is thus \"the relation of phenomena\\nwhich guarantees truth of fact regarding sensible objects.\"\\nConstancy, regularity, justify us in ascribing reality; chaotic\\nchange and lack of orderly connection are a sign of°unreal-ity\\nunreality. Even our dreams have a reality; for they have their\\nconnections and place in experience. If we understood their\\nconnections we should even be able to explain their apparent\\nlack of connection with the rest of experience. Leibniz thinks\\nthat both the Academicians and Sceptics and their°oppo-nents\\nopponents erred in attempting to find greater reality in sensible\\nthings than that of regular phenomena. Since our°observa-tions\\nobservations and judgments upon sensible phenomena are of such a\\nnature that we can predict future phenomena and prepare\\nfor them, we have all the reality in them that can be had or\\nasked for. Even if it be granted possible (as it must be on\\nthis basis) that, metaphysically speaking, sense-experience\\nis only a connected dream, it yet has a sufficient reality; for\\nwe are not deceived in the measures taken with reference to\\nphenomena, provided that we act on the ground of their\\nobserved harmonies and relations. Thus while we are\\nobliged to admit that our senses inform us that there are\\nhard, passive, extended, indivisible things, not perfectly°con-tinuous\\ncontinuous and not intellectual in their nature, and we know on\\nmetaphysical grounds that this information is not correct, we\\n\\n ― 371 ―\\n                            \\ncannot say that our senses deceive us, for sense makes no\\nstatements regarding such matters. It is our reason that errs\\nif it takes the information that the senses give as if it were a\\ndeclaration of reason itself. Sensible things have all the\\nreality necessary for this range of experience,—practical,—\\nsuch regularity of co-existence and sequence as allows us to\\nact without being led astray.\\nBut if we regard sense-phenomena not merely in their\\nconnection with one another, but in their dependence upon\\nthe absolute realities, we have still better justification for\\ntheir comparative reality. These phenomena are°conse-quences\\nconsequences of necessary and eternal truths. One endowed with\\na perfect knowledge of such truths would be able to deduce,\\na priori, the phenomena from them. The reality of sensible\\nphenomena thus consists not merely in their connection with\\none another, but in the fact that they are connected as the\\nlaws of the intelligible world require. They follow not only\\nrules of co-existence and sequence; but these rules may be\\nbrought under general laws of motion, which in turn may be\\ndeduced from geometrical principles. These latter, however,\\nare a priori; they are truths which are grounded in the very\\nintelligence of God. The sensible has its basis in the ideal.\\nTo state the same fact in another way, all sensible°phenom-ena\\nphenomena occur in time and space; or rather, time and space are\\nthe orders, the relations, of phenomena occurring and°exist-ing\\nexisting. But, as we have just seen, time and space are ideal. A\\nrelation, as Leibniz points out, being neither attribute nor\\naccident, cannot be in the things which it relates, as their\\npossession. In his own words, it cannot be conceived as if it\\nhad one leg in one object, the other leg in the other. A\\nrelation is not a material bond, running through or°cement-ing\\ncementing objects; it is ideal, existing in the mind. And while it is\\ntrue that space and time are the relations of objects and\\nevents, it is also true that if all objects and events were\\nannihilated, space and time would continue to have their\\nideal existence in the intelligence of God as the eternal\\nconditions of phenomena. They thus form the links between\\nabsolute reality and the reality of sensible existence. The\\nprinciple of sufficient reason forms another link. It may be\\nrecalled that in discussing Leibniz\\'s theory of volition we\\n\\n ― 372 ―\\n                            \\nfound that the will of God in relation to the sensible world is\\nalways determined by the choice of the better; that in this\\nconsists the controlling reason and regulative principle of all\\nthat occurs and exists. Thus for every fact in the sensible\\nworld there is connection with \"metaphysical,\" or absolute,\\nreality, not only through the medium of the intellectual\\nrelations of time and space, but through the dynamic°inter-mediary\\nintermediary of the divine will acting in accordance with the\\ndivine reason. Sensible facts have, then, a reality, but a\\ndependent one. There would be no contradiction involved if\\nthey were not what they actually are.\\nWe may sum up the matter by saying that the reality\\nof sensible phenomena consists in the constancy of the°mu-tual\\nmutual order in which they exist, and in the dependence of this\\norder upon the divine intelligence and will. In this respect,\\nat least, Leibniz resembles the young Irish idealist,°Berke-ley\\nBerkeley, who only seven years after Leibniz wrote the New\\nEssays composed his Principles of Human Knowledge,°urg-ing\\nurging that the immediate reality of sense-phenomena consists\\nin their \"steadiness, order, and coherence,\" \"in a constant\\nuniform working,\" and that this \"gives us a foresight which\\nenables us to regulate our actions for the benefit of life.\" It\\nwas Berkeley also who wrote that their ultimate reality\\nconsists in their being ideas of a divine spirit. This was six\\nyears before the death of Leibniz. Yet it does not appear that\\nBerkeley knew of Leibniz, and the only allusion to Berkeley\\nwhich I have found in the writings of Leibniz shows that\\nLeibniz knew only of that caricature of his views which has\\nalways been current,—that Berkeley was one who denied the\\nexistence of any external world. What he writes is as°fol-lows\\nfollows: \"As for him in Ireland who questions the reality of\\n\\'bodies,\\' he seems neither to offer what is rational, nor\\nsufficiently to explain his own ideas. I suspect that he is one\\nof those men who are desirous of making themselves known\\nthrough paradoxes.\"\\n\\n ― 373 ―\\n                            \\n9: Some Fundamental ConceptionsThe fundamental category of Locke, as of all who take\\nsimply a mechanical view of experience, is that of substance.\\nHe had good reason to be surprised when the Bishop of\\nWorcester objected that Locke wished \"to discard substance\\nout of the world.\" How can that be so, Locke asks, when I\\nsay that \"our idea of body is an extended solid substance,\\nand our idea of soul is of a substance that thinks.\" And he\\nadds, \"Nay, as long as there is any simple idea or sensible\\nquality left, according to my way of arguing, substance\\ncannot be discarded.\" Everything that really exists, is,°ac-cording\\naccording to Locke, substance. But substance to Locke, as\\nagain to all who interpret the universe after sensible°catego-ries\\ncategories, is unknowable. For such categories allow only of°exter-nal\\nexternal relations; they admit only of static existence. Substance,\\nin this way of looking at it, must be distinct from its°quali-ties\\nqualities, and must be simply the existing substratum in which\\nthey inhere.\\nLocke\\'s account of the way in which we get the idea,\\nand of its nature, is as follows: \"All the ideas of all the\\nsensible qualities of a cherry come into my mind by°sensa-tion\\nsensation. The ideas of these qualities and actions, or powers, are\\nperceived by the mind to be by themselves inconsistent with\\nexistence. They cannot subsist of themselves. Hence the\\nmind perceives their necessary connection with inherence, or\\nwith being supported.\" Correlative to the idea of being\\nsupported is, of course, the idea of the support. But this idea\\n\"is not represented to the mind by any clear and distinct\\nidea; the obscure and vague, indistinct idea of thing or\\nsomething, is all that is left.\" Or yet more simply, \"Taking\\nnotice that a certain number of simple ideas go together, and\\n\\n ― 374 ―\\n                            \\nnot imagining how these simple ideas can subsist by°them-selves\\nthemselves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some substratum\\nwherein they do subsist, and from which they do result.\"\\nHence the only idea we have of it is of something which\\nunderlies known qualities. It is their \"supposed, but°un-known\\nunknown, support.\"\\nIf we translate these expressions into the ideas of to-\\nday, we see that they are equivalent to the view of the world\\nwhich is given us by scientific categories when these°catego-ries\\ncategories are regarded not merely as scientific, but also as°philo-sophic\\nphilosophic; that is, capable of interpreting and expressing the\\nultimate nature of experience. This modern view uses the\\nwords \"things-in-themselves\" (or absolute realities) and\\n\"phenomena.\" It says that we know nothing of existence as\\nit is in itself, but only of its phenomena. Mind, matter,\\nobjects, are all substances, all equally substances, and all\\nhave their unknown essence and their phenomenal°appear-ance\\nappearance. Such a distinction between the known and the°un-known\\nunknown can rest, it is evident, only upon a separation between\\nreality and phenomena similar to that which Locke makes\\nbetween substance and qualities. In knowing the latter, we\\nknow nothing of the former. Although the latter are called\\n\"phenomena,\" they do not really manifest the substantial\\nreality; they conceal it. This absolute distinction between\\nsubstance and quality, between reality and phenomenon,\\nrests, in turn, upon the hypothesis that reality is mere°exist-ence\\nexistence; that is, it is something which is, and that is all. It is a\\nsubstratum; it lies under, in a passive way, qualities; it is\\n(literally) substance; it simply stands, inactively, under\\nphenomena. It may, by possibility, have actions; but it has\\nthem. Activities are qualities which, like all qualities, are in\\nexternal relation to the substance. Being, in other words, is\\nthe primary notion, and \"being\" means something°essen-tially\\nessentially passive and merely enduring, accidentally and°second-arily\\nsecondarily something acting. Here, as elsewhere, Locke is the\\nfather of the mechanical philosophy of to-day.\\nWe have already learned how completely Leibniz°re-verses\\nreverses this way of regarding reality. According to Locke,\\nreality essentially is; and in its being there is no ground of\\nrevelation of itself. It then acts; but these actions, \"powers,\\n\\n ― 375 ―\\n                            \\nor qualities,\" since not flowing from the very being of°sub-stance\\nsubstance, give no glimpse into its true nature. According to\\nLeibniz, reality acts, and therefore is. Its being is°condi-tioned\\nconditioned upon its activity. It is not first there, and secondly\\nacts; but its \"being there\" is its activity. Since its very\\nsubstance is activity, it is impossible that it should not\\nmanifest its true nature. Its every activity is a revelation of\\nitself. It cannot hide itself as a passive subsistence behind\\nqualities or phenomena. It must break forth into them. On\\nthe other hand, since the qualities are not something which\\nmerely inhere in an underlying support, but are the various\\nforms or modes of the activity which constitutes reality, they\\nnecessarily reveal it. They are its revelations. There is here\\nno need to dwell further on the original dynamic nature of\\nsubstance; what was said in the way of general exposition\\nsuffices. It is only in its relations to Locke\\'s view as just laid\\ndown that it now concerns us.\\nIn the first place, Leibniz points out that qualities are\\n\"abstract,\" while substance is \"concrete.\" The qualities,\\nfrom the very fact that they have no self-subsistence, are\\nonly relations, while the substance, as that of which they are\\nqualities, or from which they are abstractions, is concrete. It\\nis, Leibniz says, to invert the true order to take qualities or\\nabstract terms as the best known and most easily°compre-hended\\ncomprehended, and \"concretes\" as unknown, and as having the\\nmost difficulty about them. \"It is abstractions which give\\nbirth to almost all our difficulties,\" and Locke\\'s error here is\\nthat he begins with abstractions, and takes them to be most\\nopen to intelligence. Locke\\'s second error is separating so\\ncompletely substance and attribute. \"After having°distin-guished\\ndistinguished,\" says Leibniz, \"two things in substance, the°attri-butes\\nattributes or predicates, and the common subject of these°predi-cates\\npredicates, it is not to be wondered at that we cannot conceive\\nanything in particular in the subject. This result is°neces-sary\\nnecessary, since we have separated all the attributes in which\\nthere is anything definite to be conceived. Hence to demand\\nanything more than a mere unknown somewhat in the°sub-ject\\nsubject, is to contradict the supposition which was made in\\nmaking the abstraction and in conceiving separately the\\nsubject and its qualities or accidents.\" We are indeed°igno-rant\\n ― 376 ―\\n                            \\nignorant of a subject from which abstraction has been made of\\nall defining and characteristic qualities; \"but this ignorance\\nresults from our demanding a sort of knowledge of which\\nthe object does not permit.\" In short, it is a credit to our\\nknowledge, not an aspersion upon it, that we cannot know\\nthat which is thoroughly unreal,—a substance deprived of\\nall attributes. This is, indeed, a remark which is applicable\\nto the supposed unknowableness of pure Being, or absolute\\nBeing, when it is defined as the absence of all relations (as is\\ndone, for example, by Mr. Spencer to-day).\\nClosely connected with the notion of substance are the\\ncategories of identity and diversity. These relations are of\\ncourse to Locke thoroughly external. It is \"relation of time\\nand place which always determines identity.\" \"That that\\nhad one beginning is the same thing; and that which had a\\ndifferent beginning in time and place from that, is not the\\nsame, but diverse.\" It is therefore easy to discover the°prin-ciple\\nprinciple of individuation. It \"is existence itself, which°deter-mines\\ndetermines a being of any sort to a particular time and place,\\nincommunicable to two beings of the same kind.\" He applies\\nthis notion to organic being, including man, and to the\\npersonal identity of man. The identity of an organism,°vege-table\\nvegetable, brute, or human, is its continuous organization; \"it is\\nthe participation of the same continued life, by constantly\\nfleeting particles of matter in succession vitally united to the\\nsame organized body.\" Personal identity is constituted by a\\nsimilar continuity of consciousness. \"It being the same°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness that makes a man be himself to himself, personal\\nidentity depends on that only.\" It \"consists not in the°iden-tity\\nidentity of substance, but in the identity of consciousness.\" It will\\nbe noticed that Locke uses the notion of identity which he\\nhas already established to explain organic and personal\\nunity. It is the \"same continued life,\" \"identity of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness,\" that constitute them. We are, hence, introduced to no\\nnew principle. Identity is even in personality a matter of\\ntemporal and spatial relations.\\nIn the general account of the system of Leibniz it was\\npointed out that it is characteristic of his thought to regard\\nidentity and distinction as internal principles, and as°neces-sarily\\nnecessarily implied in each other. We need not go over that\\n\\n ― 377 ―\\n                            \\nground again, but simply see how he states his position with\\nreference to what is quoted from Locke. These are his\\nwords: \"Besides the difference of place and time there is\\nalways necessary an internal principle [or law] of°distinc-tion\\ndistinction, so that while there may be several things of the same\\nspecies, there are no two things exactly alike. Thus,°al-though\\nalthough time and place (that is, relations to the external) aid\\nus in distinguishing things, things do not cease to be°distin-guished\\ndistinguished in themselves. The essence of identity and diversity\\ndoes not consist in time and place, although it is true that\\ndiversity of things is accompanied with that of time and\\nplace, since they carry along with them different°impres-sions\\nimpressions upon the thing\"; that is, they expose the thing to\\ndifferent surroundings. But in reality \"it is things which\\ndiversify times and places from one another, for in°them-selves\\nthemselves these are perfectly similar, not being substances or\\ncomplete realities.\"\\nThe principle of individuation follows, of course, from\\nthis. \"If two individuals were perfectly similar and equal,\\nthat is, indistinguishable in themselves, there would be no\\nprinciple of individuation; there would not be two°individu-als\\nindividuals.\" Thus Leibniz states his important principle of the\\n\"identity of indiscernibles,\" the principle that where there is\\nnot some internal differentiating principle which specifies\\nthe existence in this or that definite way, there is no°individ-ual\\nindividual. Leibniz here states, in effect, the principle of organic\\nunity, the notion that concrete unity is a unity of differences,\\nnot from them. It is the principle which allows him at once\\nto accept and transform the thought of Spinoza that all\\nqualification or determination is negation. Spinoza, in spite\\nof his intellectual greatness, conceived of distinction or°de-termination\\ndetermination as external, and hence as external negation. But\\nsince ultimate reality admits of no external negation, it must\\nbe without distinction, an all-inclusive one. But to Leibniz\\nthe negation is internal; it is determination of its own being\\ninto the greatest possible riches. \"Things that are conceived\\nas absolutely uniform and containing no variety are pure\\nabstractions.\" \"Things indistinguishable in themselves, and\\ncapable of being distinguished only by external°characteris-tics\\ncharacteristics without internal foundation, are contrary to the most\\n\\n ― 378 ―\\n                            \\nimportant principles of reason. The truth is that every being\\nis capable of change [or differentiation], and is itself actually\\nchanged in such a way that in itself it differs from every\\nother.\"\\nAs to organic bodies, so far as they are bodies, or\\ncorporeal, they are one and identical only in appearance.\\n\"They are not the same an instant. . . . Bodies are in\\nconstant flux.\" \"They are like a river which is always\\nchanging its water, or like the ship of Theseus which the\\nAthenians are constantly repairing.\" Such unity as they\\nreally possess is like all unity,—ideal or spiritual. \"They\\nremain the same individual by virtue of that same soul or\\nspirit which constitutes the \\'Ego\\' in those individuals who\\nthink.\" \"Except for the soul, there is neither the same life\\nnor any vital union.\" As to personal identity, Leibniz°distin-guishes\\ndistinguishes between \"physical or real\" identity and \"moral.\" In\\nneither case, however, is it a unity which excludes plurality,\\nan identity which does not comprehend diversity. \"Every\\nspirit has,\" he says, \"traces of all the impressions which it\\nhas ever experienced, and even presentiments of all that ever\\nwill happen. But these feelings are generally too minute to\\nbe distinguished and brought into consciousness, though\\nthey may be sometime developed. This continuity and\\nconnection of perceptions makes up the real identity of the\\nindividual, while apperceptions (that which is consciously\\napprehended of past experiences) constitute the moral°iden-tity\\nidentity and make manifest the real identity.\" We have had\\noccasion before to allude to the part played in the Leibnizian\\nphilosophy by \"minute perceptions\" or \"unconscious\\nideas.\" Of them he says, relative to the present point, that\\n\"insensible perceptions mark and even constitute the°same-ness\\nsameness of the individual, which is characterized by the residua\\npreserved from its preceding states, as they form its°connec-tion\\nconnection with its present state.\" If these connections are°\"apper-ceived\\n\"apperceived\" or brought into distinct consciousness, there is\\nmoral identity as well. As he expresses it in one place: \"The\\nself (soi) is real and physical identity; the appearance of\\nself, accompanied with truth, is personal identity.\" But the\\nessential point in either case is that the identity is not that of\\na substance underlying modifications, nor of a consciousness\\n\\n ― 379 ―\\n                            \\nwhich merely accompanies all mental states, but is the\\nconnection, the active continuity, or—in Kant\\'s word—the\\nsynthesis, of all particular forms of the mental life. The self\\nis not the most abstract unity of experience, it is the most\\norganic. What Leibniz says of his monads generally is°espe-cially\\nespecially true of the higher monads,—human souls. \"They\\nvary, up to infinity itself, with the greatest abundance,\\norder, and beauty imaginable.\" Not a mathematical point,\\nbut life, is the type of Leibniz\\'s conception of identity.\\nIn the order in which Locke takes up his topics (and in\\nwhich Leibniz follows him) we have omitted one subject,\\nwhich, however, may find its natural place in the present\\nconnection,—the subject of infinity. In Locke\\'s conception,\\nthe infinite is only a ceaseless extension or multiplication of\\nthe finite. He considers the topic immediately after the°dis-cussions\\ndiscussions of space, time, and number, and with good logic\\nfrom his standpoint; for \"finite and infinite,\" he says, are\\n\"looked upon by the mind as the modes of quantity, and are\\nattributed, in their first designation, only to those things\\nwhich have parts and are capable of increase and°diminu-tion\\ndiminution.\" This is true even of the application of the term°\"infi-nite\\n\"infinite\" to God, so far as concerns the attributes of duration\\nand ubiquity; and as applied to his other attributes the term\\nis figurative, signifying that they are incomprehensible and\\ninexhaustible. Such being the idea of the infinite, it is°at-tained\\nattained as follows: There is no difficulty, says Locke, as to\\nthe way in which we come by the idea of the finite. Every\\nobvious portion of extension and period of succession which\\naffects us is bounded. If we take one of these periods or\\nportions, we find that we can double it, or \"otherwise°multi-ply\\nmultiply it,\" as often as we wish, and that there is no reason to\\nstop, nor are we one jot nearer the end at any point of the\\nmultiplication than when we set out. \"By repeating as often\\nas we will any idea of space, we get the idea of infinity; by\\nbeing able to repeat the idea of any length of duration, we\\ncome by the idea of eternity.\" There is a difference, then,\\nbetween the ideas of the infinity of space, time, and number,\\nand of an infinite space, time, and number. The former idea\\nwe have; it is the idea that we can continue without end the\\nprocess of multiplication or progression. The latter we have\\n\\n ― 380 ―\\n                            \\nnot; it would be the idea of having completed the infinite\\nmultiplication, it would be the result of the never-ending\\nprogression. And this is evidently a contradiction in terms.\\nTo sum the matter up, the term \"infinite\" always relates to\\nthe notion of quantity. Quantity is that which is essentially\\ncapable of increase or decrease. There is then an infinity of\\nquantity; there is no quantity which is the absolute limit to\\nquantity. Such a quantity would be incapable of increase,\\nand hence contradictory to quantity. But an actual infinite\\nquantity (whether of space, time, or number) would be one\\nthan which there could be no greater; and hence the°impossi-bility\\nimpossibility of our having a positive idea of an actual or completed\\ninfinite.\\nLeibniz\\'s reply consists simply in carrying out this same\\nthought somewhat further. It is granted that the idea of an\\ninfinite quantity of any kind is absurd and°self-contradic-tory\\nself-contradictory. But what does this prove, except that the notions of\\nquantity and infinity are incompatible with each other, that\\nthey contradict each other? Hence, instead of the infinite\\nbeing a mode of quantity, it must be conceived as essentially\\ndistinct from and even opposed to quantity. Locke\\'s°argu-ment\\nargument is virtually a reductio ad absurdum of the notion that\\nthe infinite is capable of parts. In the few pages of comment\\nwhich Leibniz in 1696 wrote upon Locke, this topic of the\\ninfinite is one of the few touched upon. His words upon that\\noccasion were as follows: \"I agree with Mr. Locke that,\\nproperly speaking, there is no space, time, nor number\\nwhich is infinite; and that it is only true that however great\\nbe a space, a time, or a number, there is always another\\nwhich is still greater, and this without end; and that,°there-fore\\ntherefore, the infinite is not to be found in a whole made up of\\nparts. But it does not cease to exist: it is found in the\\nabsolute, which is without parts, and of which compound\\nthings [phenomena in space and time, or facts which may be\\nnumbered] are only limitations. The positive infinite being\\nnothing else than the absolute, it may be said that there is, in\\nthis sense, a positive idea of the infinite, and that it is\\nanterior to the idea of the finite.\" In other words, while the\\ninfinite is to Locke an indefinite extension of the finite, which\\nalone is positively \"given,\" to Leibniz the infinite is the\\n\\n ― 381 ―\\n                            \\npositive and real, and the finite is only in and by it. The\\nfinite is the negative.\\nLeibniz amplifies this thought upon other occasions, as\\nin his present more extended examination. \"There is no\\ninfinite number, line, or quantity, if they are taken as true\\nwholes.\" \"We deceive ourselves in trying to imagine an\\nabsolute space which should be an infinite whole, composed\\nof parts. There is none such. It is an idea which implies\\ncontradiction; and all these \\'infinites\\' and \\'infinitesimals\\' are\\nof use only in geometry, as imaginary roots are in algebra.\"\\nThat which is ordinarily called the infinite, that is, the\\nquantitative infinite, is in reality only the indefinite. \"We\\ninvolve ourselves in difficulty when we talk about a series of\\nnumbers extending to infinity; we imagine a last term, an\\ninfinite number, or one infinitely little. But these are only\\nfictions. All number is finite and assignable [that is, of a\\ncertain definite quantity]; every line is the same. \\'Infinites\\'\\nand \\'infinitesimals\\' signify only quantities which can be\\ntaken as large or as small as one wishes, simply for the\\npurpose of showing that there is no error which can be\\nassigned. Or we are to understand by the infinitely little, the\\nstate of vanishing or commencing of a quantum after the\\nanalogy of a quantum already formed.\" On the other hand,\\nthe true infinite \"is not an aggregate, nor a whole of parts; it\\nis not clothed with magnitude, nor does it consist in number.\\n. . . The Absolute alone, the indivisible infinite, has true\\nunity,—I mean God.\" And as he sums up the matter: \"The\\ninfinite, consisting of parts, is neither one nor a whole; it\\ncannot be brought under any notion of the mind except that\\nof quantity. Only the infinite without parts is one, and this is\\nnot a whole [of parts]: this infinite is God.\"\\nIt cannot be admitted, however, that Locke has given a\\ncorrect account of the origin of the notion of the quantitative\\ninfinite, or-to speak philosophically, and not after the use of\\nterms convenient in mathematics—the indefinite. According\\nto him, its origin is the mere empirical repeating of a°sen-suous\\nsensuous datum of time and space. According to Leibniz, this\\nrepetition, however long continued, can give no idea beyond\\nitself; it can never generate the idea that the process of\\nrepetition may be continued without a limit. Here, as°else-where\\n ― 382 ―\\n                            \\nelsewhere, he objects that experience cannot guarantee notions\\nbeyond the limits of experience. Locke\\'s process of°repeti-tion\\nrepetition could tell us that a number had been extended up to a\\ngiven point; not that it could be extended without limit. The\\nsource of this latter idea must be found, therefore, where we\\nfind the origin of all extra-empirical notions,—in reason. \"Its\\norigin is the same as that of universal and necessary truths.\"\\nIt is not the empirical process of multiplying, but the fact\\nthat the same reason for multiplying always exists, that\\noriginates and guarantees the idea. \"Take a straight line\\nand prolong it in such a way that it is double the first. It is\\nevident that the second, being perfectly similar to the first,\\ncan be itself doubled; and we have a third, which in turn is\\nsimilar to the preceding. The same reason always being\\npresent, it is not possible that the process should ever be\\nbrought to a stop. Thus the line can be prolonged \\'to°infin-ity\\ninfinity.\\' Therefore the idea of \\'infinity\\' comes from the°consider-ation\\nconsideration of the identity of relation or of reason.\"\\nThe considerations which we have grouped together in\\nthis chapter serve to show the fundamental philosophical\\ndifference between Locke and Leibniz. Although, taken in\\ndetail, they are self-explanatory, a few words may be°permit-ted\\npermitted upon their unity and ultimate bearing. It is characteristic\\nof Locke that he uses the same principle of explanation with\\nreference to the conceptions of substance, identity and°diver-sity\\ndiversity, and infinity, and that this principle is that of spatial and\\ntemporal relation. Infinity is conceived as quantitative, as\\nthe successive addition of times and spaces; identity and\\ndiversity are oneness and difference of existence as°deter-mined\\ndetermined by space and time; substance is the underlying static\\nsubstratum of qualities, and, as such, is considered after the\\nanalogy of things existing in space and through time. It\\nmust not be forgotten that Locke believed as thoroughly as\\nLeibniz in the substantial existence of the world, of the\\nhuman soul, and of God; in the objective continuity of the\\nworld, and the personal identity of man, and in the true\\ninfinity of God. Whatever negative or sceptical inferences\\nmay have afterwards been drawn from Locke\\'s premises\\nwere neither drawn nor dreamed of by him. His purpose was\\nin essence one with that of Leibniz.\\n\\n ― 383 ―\\n                            \\nBut the contention of Leibniz is that when substance,\\nidentity, and infinity are conceived of by mechanical°catego-ries\\ncategories, or measured by the sensible standard of space and time,\\nthey lose their meaning and their validity. According to him\\nsuch notions are spiritual in their nature, and to be°spiritu-ally\\nspiritually conceived of. \"Spiritual,\" however, does not mean°op-posed\\nopposed to the sensible; it does not mean something to be\\nknown by a peculiar kind of intuition unlike our knowledge\\nof anything else. It means the active and organic basis of the\\nsensible, its significance and ideal purpose. It is known by\\nknowing the sensible or mechanical as it really is; that is, as\\nit is completely, as a concretum, in Leibniz\\'s phrase. Leibniz\\nsaw clearly that to make the infinite something at one end of\\nthe finite, as its mere external limit, or something°miracu-lously\\nmiraculously intercalated into the finite, was to deprive it of°mean-ing\\nmeaning, and, by making it unknowable, to open the way for its\\ndenial. To make identity consist in the removal of all°diver-sity\\ndiversity (as must be done if it be thought after the manner of\\nexternal relations), is to reduce it to nothing,—as Hume,\\nindeed, afterwards showed. Substance, which is merely a\\nsupport behind qualities, is unknowable, and hence°unverifi-able\\nunverifiable. While, then, the aim of both Locke and Leibniz as\\nregards these categories was the same, Leibniz saw what\\nLocke did not,—that to interpret them after the manner of\\nexistence in space and time, to regard them (in Leibniz\\'s\\nterminology) as mathematical, and not as metaphysical, is\\nto defeat that aim. The sole way to justify them, and in\\njustifying them to give relative validity to the sensible and\\nphenomenal, is to demonstrate their spiritual and dynamic\\nnature, to show them as conditioning space and time, and\\nnot as conditioned by them.\\n\\n ― 384 ―\\n                            \\n10: The Nature and Extent of KnowledgeThe third book of Locke\\'s Essay is upon words and°lan-guage\\nlanguage; and in the order of treatment this would be the next\\ntopic for discussion. But much of what is said in this°connec-tion\\nconnection both by Locke and by Leibniz is philological, rhetorical,\\nand grammatical in character, and although not without\\ninterest in itself, is yet without any especial bearing upon the\\nphilosophical points in controversy. The only topics in this\\nbook demanding our attention are general and particular\\nterms; but these fall most naturally into the discussion of\\ngeneral and particular knowledge. In fact, it is not the terms\\nwhich Locke actually discusses, but the ideas for which the\\nterms stand. We pass on accordingly, without further°cere-mony\\nceremony, to the fourth book, which is concerning knowledge in\\ngeneral. Locke defines knowledge as \"nothing but the°per-ception\\nperception of the connection and agreement, or disagreement\\nand repugnancy, of any of our ideas.\" These agreements or\\ndisagreements may be reduced to four sorts,—Identity, or\\ndiversity; Relation; Co-existence, or necessary connection;\\nReal Existence. The statement of identity and diversity is\\nimplied in all knowledge whatsoever. By them \"the mind\\nclearly and infallibly perceives each idea to agree with itself\\nand be what it is, and all distinct ideas to disagree; i.e., the\\none not to be the other.\" The agreement of relation is such\\nknowledge as the mind derives from the comparison of its\\nideas. It includes mathematical knowledge. The connection\\nof co-existence \"belongs particularly to substances.\"\\nLocke\\'s example is that \"gold is fixed,\"-by which we°un-derstand\\nunderstand that the idea of fixedness goes along with that\\n\\n ― 385 ―\\n                            \\ngroup of ideas which we call gold. All statements of fact\\ncoming under the natural sciences would fall into this class.\\nThe fourth sort is \"that of actual and real existence agreeing\\nto any idea.\"\\nLeibniz\\'s criticism upon these statements of Locke is\\nbrief and to the point. He admits Locke\\'s definition of\\nknowledge, qualifying it, however, by the statement that in\\nmuch of our knowledge, perhaps in all that is merely°empiri-cal\\nempirical, we do not know the reason and connection of things and\\nhence cannot be said to perceive the agreement or°disagree-ment\\ndisagreement of ideas, but only to feel it confusedly. His most\\nimportant remark, however, is to the effect that relation is\\nnot a special kind of knowledge, but that all Locke\\'s four\\nkinds are varieties of relation. Locke\\'s \"connection\" of ideas\\nwhich makes knowledge is nothing but relation. And there\\nare two kinds of relation,—those of \"comparison\" and of\\n\"concourse.\" That of comparison states the identity or°dis-tinction\\ndistinction of ideas, either in whole or in part. That of°con-course\\nconcourse contains Locke\\'s two classes of co-existence and°exist-ence\\nexistence. \"When we say that a thing really exists, this existence\\nis the predicate,—that is to say, a notion connected with the\\nidea which is the subject; and there is connection between\\nthese two notions. The existence of an object of an idea may\\nbe considered as the concourse of this object with me. Hence\\ncomparison, which marks identity or diversity, and°con-course\\nconcourse of an object with me (or with the ego) are the only\\nforms of knowledge.\"\\nLeibniz leaves the matter here: but he only needed to\\ndevelop what is contained in this statement to anticipate\\nBerkeley and Kant in some of the most important of their\\ndiscoveries. The contradiction which lies concealed in\\nLocke\\'s account is between his definition of knowledge in\\ngeneral, and knowledge of real existence in particular. One\\nis the agreement or disagreement of ideas; the other is the\\nagreement of an idea with an object. Berkeley\\'s work, in its\\nsimplest form, was to remove this inconsistency. He saw\\nclearly that the \"object\" was an intruder here. If knowledge\\nlies in the connection of ideas, it is impossible to get outside\\nthe ideas to find an object with which they agree. Either that\\nobject is entirely unknown, or it is an idea. It is impossible,\\n\\n ― 386 ―\\n                            \\ntherefore, to find the knowledge of reality in the comparison\\nof an idea with an object. It must be in some property of the\\nideas themselves.\\nKant developed more fully the nature of this property,\\nwhich constitutes the \"objectivity\" of our ideas. It is their\\nconnection with one another according to certain necessary\\nforms of perception and rules of conception. In other words,\\nthe reality of ideas lies in their being connected by the\\nnecessary and hence universal relations of synthetic°intelli-gence\\nintelligence, or, as Kant often states it, in their agreement with the\\nconditions of self-consciousness. It is not, I believe, unduly\\nstretching either the letter or the spirit of Leibniz to find in\\nthat \"concourse of the object with the ego\" which makes its\\nreality, the analogue of this doctrine of Kant; it is at all\\nevents the recognition of the fact that reality is not to be\\nfound in the relating of ideas to unknown things, but in their\\nrelation to self-conscious intelligence. The points of°similar-ity\\nsimilarity between Kant and Leibniz do not end here. Leibniz\\'s two\\nrelations of \"comparison\" and \"concourse\" are certainly the\\ncongeners of Kant\\'s \"analytic\" and \"synthetic\" judgments.\\nBut Leibniz, as we shall see hereafter, trusts too thoroughly\\nto the merely formal relations of identity and contradiction\\nto permit him such a development of these two kinds of\\nrelation as renders Kant\\'s treatment of them epoch-making.\\nThe discussion then advances to the subject of degrees\\nof knowledge, of which Locke recognizes three,—intuitive,\\ndemonstrative, and sensitive. Intuitive knowledge is°immedi-ate\\nimmediate knowledge,—recognition of likeness or difference°with-out\\nwithout the intervention of a third idea; it is the most certain and\\nclear of all knowledge. In demonstrative knowledge the\\nagreement or disagreement cannot be perceived directly,\\nbecause the ideas cannot be put together so as to show it.\\nHence the mind has recourse to intermediaries. \"And this is\\nwhat we call reasoning.\" Demonstrative rests on intuitive\\nknowledge, because each intermediate idea used must be\\nimmediately perceived to be like or unlike its neighboring\\nidea, or it would itself need intermediates for its proof.\\nBesides these two degrees of knowledge there is \"another\\nperception of the mind employed about the particular°exist-ence\\nexistence of finite things without us, which, going beyond bare\\n\\n ― 387 ―\\n                            \\nprobability, and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the\\nforegoing degrees of certainty, passes under the name of\\nknowledge.\"\\nLeibniz\\'s comments are again brief. The primitive\\ntruths which are known by intuition are to be divided into\\ntwo classes,—truths of reason and of fact. The primitive\\ntruths of reason are necessary, and may be called identical,\\nbecause they seem only to repeat the same thing, without\\nteaching us anything. A is A. A is not non-A. Such°proposi-tions\\npropositions are not frivolous or useless, because the conclusions of\\nlogic are demonstrated by means of identical propositions,\\nand many of those of geometry by the principle of°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction. All the intuitive truths of reason may be said to be\\nmade known through the \"immediation\" of ideas. The°intui-tive\\nintuitive truths of fact, on the other hand, are contingent and are\\nmade known through the \"immediation\" of feeling. In this\\nlatter class come such truths as the Cartesian, \"I think,\\ntherefore I am.\" Neither class can be proved by anything\\nmore certain.\\nDemonstration is defined by Leibniz as by Locke. The\\nformer recognizes, however, two sorts,—analytic and°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic. Synthesis goes from the simple to the complex. There\\nare many cases, however, where this is not applicable; where\\nit would be a task \"equal to drinking up the sea to attempt\\nto make all the necessary combinations. Here the method of\\nexclusions should be employed, cutting off many of the\\nuseless combinations.\" If this cannot be done, then it is\\nanalysis which gives the clew into the labyrinth. He is also\\nof the opinion that besides demonstration, giving certainty,\\nthere should be admitted an art of calculating probabilities,\\n—the lack of which is, he says, a great defect in our present\\nlogic, and which would be more useful than a large part of\\nour demonstrative sciences. As to sensitive knowledge, he\\nagrees with Locke that there is such a thing as real°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of objects without us, and that this variety does not\\nhave the same metaphysical certainty as the other two; but\\nhe disagrees regarding its criterion. According to Locke, the\\ncriterion is simply the greater degree of vividness and force\\nthat sensations have as compared with imaginations, and the\\nactual pleasures or pains which accompany them. Leibniz\\n\\n ― 388 ―\\n                            \\npoints out that this criterion, which in reality is purely\\nemotional, is of no great value, and states the principle of the\\nreality of sensible phenomena which we have already given,\\nrepeating that it is found in the connection of phenomena,\\nand that \"this connection is verified by means of the truths\\nof reason, just as the phenomena of optics are explained by\\ngeometry.\"\\nThe discussion regarding \"primitive truths,\" axioms,\\nand maxims, as well as the distinction between truths of fact\\nand of reason, has its most important bearing in Locke\\'s next\\nchapter. This chapter has for its title the \"Extent of Human\\nKnowledge,\" and in connection with the sixth chapter, upon\\nuniversal propositions, and with the seventh, upon axioms,\\nreally contains the gist of the treatment of knowledge. It is\\nhere also that are to be considered chapters three and six of\\nbook third, having respectively as their titles, \"Of General\\nTerms,\" and \"Of the Names of Substances.\"\\nTo understand Locke\\'s views upon the extent and°limi-tations\\nlimitations of our knowledge, it is necessary to recur to his\\ntheory of its origin. If we compare what he says about the\\norigin of ideas from sensations with what he says about the\\ndevelopment of general knowledge from particular, we shall\\nfind that Locke unconsciously puts side by side two°differ-ent\\ndifferent, and even contradictory, theories upon this point. In the\\nview already given when treating of sensation, knowledge\\noriginates from the combination, the addition, of the simple\\nideas furnished us by our senses. It begins with the simple,\\nthe unrelated, and advances to the complex. But according\\nto the doctrine which he propounds in treating of general\\nterms, knowledge begins with the individual, which is°al-ready\\nalready qualified by definite relations, and hence complex, and\\nproceeds, by abstracting some of these qualities, towards the\\nsimple. Or, in Locke\\'s own language, \"ideas become general\\nby separating from them the circumstances of time and\\nplace and any other ideas that may determine them to this\\nand that particular existence.\" And, still more definitely, he\\nsays that general ideas are framed by \"leaving out of the\\ncomplex idea of individuals that which is peculiar to each,\\nand retaining only what is common to them all.\" From this\\nit follows that \"general and universal belong not to the real\\n\\n ― 389 ―\\n                            \\nexistence of things, but are the inventions and creatures of\\nthe understanding.\" \"When we quit particulars, the°gener-als\\ngenerals that rest are only creatures of our own making. . . . The\\nsignification they have is nothing but a relation that by the\\nmind of man is added to them.\" And in language which\\nreminds us of Kant, but with very different bearing, he says\\nthat relations are the workmanship of the understanding.\\nThe abstract idea of what is common to all the members of\\nthe class constitutes \"nominal essence.\" This nominal°es-sence\\nessence, not being a particular existence in nature, but the\\n\"workmanship of the understanding,\" is to be carefully\\ndistinguished from the real essence, \"which is the being of\\nanything whereby it is what it is.\" This real essence is\\nevidently equivalent to the unknown \"substance\" of which\\nwe have heard before. \"It is the real, internal, and unknown\\nconstitution of things.\" In simple or unrelated ideas and in\\nmodes the real and the nominal essence is the same; and\\nhence whatever is demonstrated of one is demonstrated of\\nthe other. But as to substance it is different, the one being\\nnatural, the other artificial. The nominal essence always\\nrelates to sorts, or classes, and is a pattern or standard by\\nwhich we classify objects. In the individual there is nothing\\nessential, in this sense. \"Particular beings, considered\\nbarely in themselves, will be found to have all their qualities\\nequally essential to them, or, which is more, nothing at all.\"\\nAs for the \"real essence\" which things have, \"we only\\nsuppose its being without precisely knowing what it is.\"\\nLocke here presents us with the confusion which, in one\\nform or another, is always found in empiricism, and which\\nindeed is essential to it. Locke, like the ordinary empiricist,\\nhas no doubt of the existence of real things. His starting-\\npoint is the existence of two substances, mind and matter;\\nwhile, further, there is a great number of substances of each\\nkind. Each mind and every separate portion of matter is a\\ndistinct substance. This supposed deliverance of common\\nsense Locke never called into question. Working on this\\nline, all knowledge will consist in abstraction from the ready-\\nmade things presented to us in perception, \"in leaving out\\nfrom the complex idea of individuals\" something belonging\\nto them. But on the other hand, Locke never doubts that\\n\\n ― 390 ―\\n                            \\nknowledge begins with sensation, and that, therefore, the\\nprocess of knowledge is one of adding simple, unrelated\\nelements. The two theories are absolutely opposed to each\\nother, and yet one and the same philosophical inference may\\nbe drawn from each; namely, that only the particular is real,\\nand that the universal (or relations) is an artificial product,\\nmanufactured in one case by abstraction from the real°indi-vidual\\nindividual, in the other by compounding the real sensation.\\nThe result is, that when he comes to a discussion of the\\nextent of knowledge, he admits knowledge of self, of God,\\nand of \"things,\" only by a denial of his very definition of\\nknowledge, while knowledge of other conceptions, like those\\nof mathematics, is not knowledge of reality, but only of\\nideas which we ourselves frame. All knowledge, that is to\\nsay, is obtained only either by contradicting his own°funda-mental\\nfundamental notion, or by placing it in relations which are°con-fessedly\\nconfessedly artificial and superinduced. It is to this point that\\nwe come.\\nThe proposition which is fundamental to the discussion\\nis that we have knowledge only where we perceive the\\nagreement or disagreement of ideas. Locke then takes up\\neach of his four classes of connection, in order to ascertain\\nthe extent of knowledge in it. Our knowledge of \"identity\\nand diversity extends as far as our ideas,\" because we°intui-tively\\nintuitively perceive every idea to be \"what it is, and different\\nfrom any other.\" Locke afterwards states, however, that all\\npurely identical propositions are \"trifling,\" that is, they\\ncontain no instruction; they teach us nothing. Thus the first\\nclass of relations cannot be said to be of much avail. If we\\nconsider the fourth kind of knowledge, that of real existence,\\nwe have an intuitive knowledge of self, a demonstrative\\nknowledge of God, and a sensitive knowledge of other\\nthings. But sensitive knowledge, it must be noted, \"does not\\nextend beyond the objects actually present to our senses.\" It\\ncan hardly be said, therefore, to assure us of the existence of\\nobjects at all. It only tells us what experiences are being at\\nthe time undergone. Furthermore, knowledge of all three\\n(God, self, and matter), since of real being, and not of\\nrelations between ideas, contradicts his definition of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge. But perhaps we shall find knowledge more extended in\\n\\n ― 391 ―\\n                            \\nthe other classes. And indeed Locke tells us that knowledge\\nof relations is the \"largest field of our knowledge.\" It°in-cludes\\nincludes morals and mathematics; but it is to be noticed that,\\naccording to Locke, in both of these branches our°demon-strations\\ndemonstrations are not regarding facts, but regarding either\\n\"modes\" framed by ourselves, or relations that are the°crea-tures\\ncreatures of our minds,—\"extraneous and superinduced\" upon\\nthe facts, as he says. He thus anticipates in substance,\\nthough not in phraseology, Hume\\'s distinction between\\n\"matters of fact\" and \"connections of ideas,\" in the latter of\\nwhich we may have knowledge, but not going beyond the\\ncombinations that we ourselves make.\\nThis leaves one class, that of co-existence, to be°exam-ined\\nexamined. Here, if anywhere, must knowledge, worthy of being\\ntermed scientific, be found. This class, it will be°remem-bered\\nremembered, comprehends our knowledge concerning substances.\\nBut this extends, according to Locke, \"a very little way.\"\\nThe idea of a substance is a complex of various \"simple\\nideas united in one subject and co-existing together.\" When\\nwe would know anything further concerning a substance,\\nwe only inquire what other simple ideas, besides those°al-ready\\nalready united, co-exist with them. Since there is no necessary\\nconnection, however, among these simple ideas, since each is,\\nby its very simplicity, essentially distinct from every other,\\nor, as we have already learned, since nothing is essential to\\nan individual, we can never be sure that any idea really\\nco-exists with others. Or, as Locke says, in physical matters\\nwe \"can go no further than particular experience informs us\\nof. . . . We can have no certain knowledge of universal\\ntruths concerning natural bodies.\" And again, \"universal\\npropositions of whose truth and falsehood we have certain\\nknowledge concern not existence\"; while, on the other hand,\\n\"particular affirmations are only concerning existence,°de-claring\\ndeclaring only the accidental union or separation of ideas in\\nthings existing.\" This particular knowledge, it must be\\nrecalled, is, in turn, only sensitive, and thus extends not\\nbeyond the time when the sensation is had.\\nWe are not surprised then at learning from Locke that\\nregarding bodies \"we are not capable of scientific°knowl-edge\\nknowledge.\" \"Natural philosophy is not capable of being made a\\n\\n ― 392 ―\\n                            \\nscience\"; or, as Locke elsewhere states it, knowledge°re-garding\\nregarding the nominal essence is \"trifling\" (Kant\\'s analytic\\njudgment); regarding the real essence is impossible. For\\nexample, when we say that all gold is fusible, this means\\neither simply that fusibility is one of the ideas which we\\ncombine to get the general idea of gold, so that in making\\nthe given judgment we only expand our own notion; or it\\nmeans that the \"real\" substance gold is always fusible. But\\nthis is a statement we have no right to make, and for two\\nreasons: we do not know what the real substance gold is;\\nand even if we did, we should not know that fusibility\\nalways co-exists with it. The summary of the whole matter\\nis that \"general certainty is to be found only in our ideas.\\nWhenever we go to seek it elsewhere, in experiment or\\nobservations without us, our knowledge goes not beyond\\nparticulars.\"\\nIt has been necessary to give an account of Locke\\'s\\nviews at this length because it is in his discussion of the\\nlimitations and extent of knowledge that his theory°culmi-nates\\nculminates. While not working out his sensationalism as°consist-ently\\nconsistently as did Hume, he yet reduces knowledge to that of the\\nexistence of God and ourselves (whose natures, however,\\nare unknown), and to a knowledge of mathematical and\\nmoral relations, which, however, concerns only \"the°habi-tudes\\nhabitudes and relations of abstract ideas.\" We have now to see\\nby what means Leibniz finds a wider sphere for certain and\\ngeneral knowledge by his theory of intellectualism than\\nLocke can by his sensationalism.\\nLeibniz\\'s theory of knowledge rests upon a distinction\\nbetween truths of fact, which are a posteriori and°contin-gent\\ncontingent, and truths of reason, which are a priori and necessary.\\nIn discussing his views regarding experience, we learned\\nthat, according to him, all judgments which are empirical\\nare also particular, not allowing any inference beyond the\\ngiven cases experienced. Experience gives only instances,\\nnot principles. If we postpone for the present the discussions\\nof truths of reason, by admitting that they may properly be\\nsaid to be at once certain and universal, the question arises\\nhow in matters of fact there can be any knowledge beyond\\nthat which Locke admits; and the answer is, that so far as\\n\\n ― 393 ―\\n                            \\nthe mere existence and occurrence of these facts is°con-cerned\\nconcerned, there is neither demonstrative nor general°knowl-edge\\nknowledge. But the intelligence of man does not stop with the\\nisolated fact; it proceeds to inquire into its cause, to°ascer-tain\\nascertain its conditions, and thus to see into, not merely its actual\\nexistence, but its possibility. In Leibniz\\'s language: \"The\\nreal existence of things that are not necessary is a point of\\nfact or history; but the knowledge of possibilities or°necessi-ties\\nnecessities (the necessary being that whose opposite is not°possi-ble\\npossible) constitutes demonstrative science.\" In other words, it is\\nthe principle of causality, which makes us see a fact not as a\\nmere fact, but as a dependent consequence; which elevates\\nknowledge, otherwise contingent and particular, into the\\nrealm of the universal and apodictic. Underlying all°\"acci-dental\\n\"accidental union\" is the real synthesis of causation.\\nIf we follow the discussion as it centres about the terms\\n\"nominal\" and \"real,\" it stands as follows: Leibniz objects\\nto the use of the term \"essence\" in this connection, but is\\nwilling to accept that of \"definition\"; for, as he says, a\\nsubstance can have but one essence, while there may be\\nseveral definitions, which, however, all express the same\\nessence. The essence is the possibility of that which is under\\nconsideration; the definition is the statement of that which is\\nsupposed to be possible. The \"nominal\" definition, however,\\nwhile it implies this possibility, does not expressly affirm it,\\n-that is to say, it may always be doubted whether the\\nnominal definition has any possibility (or reality)°corre-sponding\\ncorresponding to it until experience comes to our aid and makes\\nus know it a posteriori. A \"real\" definition, on the other\\nhand, makes us know a priori the reality of the thing defined\\nby showing us the mode of its production, \"by exhibiting its\\ncause or generation.\" Even our knowledge of facts of°experi-ence\\nexperience cannot be said, therefore, to be arbitrary, for we do not\\ncombine ideas just as we please, but \"our combinations may\\nbe justified by reason which shows them to be possible, or by\\nexperience which shows them to be actual, and consequently\\nalso possible.\" To take Locke\\'s example about gold, \"the\\nessence of gold is that which constitutes it and gives it its\\nsensible qualities, and these qualities, so far as they enable\\nus to recognize it, constitute its nominal essence, while a real\\n\\n ― 394 ―\\n                            \\nand causal definition would enable us to explain the°contex-ture\\ncontexture or internal disposition. The nominal definition,°how-ever\\nhowever, is also real in one sense,—not in itself, indeed, since\\nit does not enable us to know a priori the possibility or\\nproduction of the body, but empirically real.\"\\nIt is evident from these quotations that what Leibniz\\nunderstands by \"possibility\" is the condition or cause of a\\ngiven fact; and that, while Locke distinguishes between\\nparticular, accidental and demonstrative, general knowledge\\nas two opposed kinds, concerned with two distinct and°mu-tually\\nmutually exclusive spheres, with Leibniz they are distinctions\\nin the aspect of the same sphere of fact. In reality there is no\\ncombination of qualities accidental, as Locke thought that\\nby far the greater part were; in every empirical fact there is\\na cause or condition involved that is invariable, and that\\nconstitutes the reason of the fact. The \"accidental\" is only\\nin the relation of our ideas to objects, not in the objects\\nthemselves. There may be accidental mental associations;\\nthere are no accidental relations. In empirical, or a°poste-riori\\nposteriori, knowledge, so-called, the reason is there, but is not\\nknown. A priori knowledge, the real definition, discovers\\nand explicitly states this reason. Contingent knowledge is\\ntherefore potentially rational; demonstrative knowledge is\\nthe actual development of the reasons implicitly contained in\\nexperience.\\nWe may with advantage connect this discussion with\\nthe fundamental doctrine of Locke and Leibniz regarding\\nintelligence and reality. To Locke, as we have seen,°knowl-edge\\nknowledge is essentially a matter of relations or connections; but\\nrelations are \"superinduced\" and \"extraneous\" as regards\\nthe facts. Every act of knowledge constitutes, therefore, in\\nsome way a departure from the reality to be known.°Knowl-edge\\nKnowledge and fact are, by their very definition, opposed to one\\nanother. But in Leibniz\\'s view intelligence, or reason, enters\\ninto the constitution of reality; indeed, it is reality. The\\nrelations which are the \"creatures of the understanding\"\\nare, therefore, not foreign to the material to be known, but\\nare organic to it, forming its content. The process, then, in\\nwhich the mind perceives the connections or relations of\\nideas or objects, is simply the process by which the mind\\n\\n ― 395 ―\\n                            \\ncomes to the consciousness of the real nature of these°ob-jects\\nobjects, not a process of \"superinducing\" unreal ideas upon\\nthem. The difficulty of Locke is the difficulty of every theory\\nof knowledge that does not admit an organic unity of the\\nknowing mind and the known universe. The theory is\\nobliged to admit that all knowledge is in the form of°rela-tions\\nrelations which have their source in intelligence. But being tied\\nto the view that reality is distinct from intelligence, it is\\nobliged to draw the conclusion that these relations are not to\\nbe found in actual existence, and hence that all knowledge,\\nwhatever else it may be, is unreal in the sense that it does\\nnot and cannot conform to actual fact. But, in the theory of\\nLeibniz, the process of relating which is the essence of\\nknowledge is only the realization on the part of the°individ-ual\\nindividual mind of the relations or reasons that eternally constitute\\nreality. Since reality is, and is what it is, through°intelli-gence\\nintelligence, whatever relations intelligence rightly perceives are\\nnot \"extraneous\" to reality, but are its \"essence.\" As°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz says, \"Truth consists in the relations between the objects\\nof our ideas. This does not depend upon language, but is\\ncommon to us with God, so that when God manifests a truth\\nto us, we acquire what is already in his understanding. For\\nalthough there is an infinite difference between his ideas and\\nours as to their perfection and extent, yet it is always true\\nthat as to the same relation they are identical. And it is in\\nthis relation that truth exists.\" To this may be added°an-other\\nanother statement, which throws still further light on this\\npoint: \"Ideas are eternally in God, and are in us before we\\nperceive them.\"\\nWe have now to consider somewhat more in detail the\\nmeans by which the transformation of empirical into°ra-tional\\nrational knowledge is carried on. Leibniz points out that the\\ndifficulty concerning scientific knowledge of sensible facts is\\nnot lack of data, but, in a certain sense, superfluity of data.\\nIt is not that we perceive no connections among objects, but\\nthat we perceive many which we cannot reduce to one\\nanother. \"Our experiences,\" says Leibniz, \"are simple only\\nin appearance, for they are always accompanied by°circum-stances\\ncircumstances connected with them, although these relations are\\nnot understood by us. These circumstances furnish material\\n\\n ― 396 ―\\n                            \\ncapable of explanation and analysis. There is thus a sort of\\npleonasm in our perceptions of sensible objects and qualities,\\nsince we have more than one idea of the same object. Gold\\ncan be nominally defined in many ways. Such definitions are\\nonly provisional.\" This is to say, empirical knowledge will\\nbecome rational when it is possible to view any subject-\\nmatter as a unity, instead of a multiplicity of varied aspects.\\nAnd on this same subject he says, in another connection: \"A\\ngreat number of experiences can furnish us data more than\\nsufficient for scientific knowledge, provided only we have the\\nart of using these data.\" The aim of science is therefore, to\\ndiscover the dynamic unity which makes a whole of what\\nappears to be a mere mass of accidentally connected°circum-stances\\ncircumstances. This unity of relations is the individual.\\nIt is thus evident that to Leibniz the individual is not\\nthe beginning of knowledge, but its goal. The individual is\\nthe organic, the dynamic unity of the variety of phases or\\nnotions presented us in sense-experience. Individuality is not\\n\"simplicity\" in the sense of Locke; that is, separation from\\nall relations. It is complete connection of all relations. \"It is\\nimpossible for us to have [complete] knowledge of°individu-als\\nindividuals, and to find the means of determining exactly the°individ-uality\\nindividuality of anything; for in individuality all circumstances are\\ncombined. Individuality envelops the infinite. Only so far as\\nwe know the infinite do we know the individual, on account\\nof the influence (if this word be correctly understood) that\\nall things in the universe exercise upon one another.\"°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz, in short, remains true to his conception of the monad as\\nthe ultimate reality; for the monad, though an individual,\\nyet has the universe as its content. We shall be able,°there-fore\\ntherefore, to render our sensible experiences rational just in the\\ndegree in which we can discover the underlying relations\\nand dependencies which make them members of one°individ-ual\\nindividual.\\nFor the process of transformation Leibniz relies°espe-cially\\nespecially upon two methods?—those of mathematics and of°clas-sification\\nclassification. Of the former he here says but little; but the entire\\nprogress of physical science since the time of Leibniz has\\nbeen the justification of that little. In the passage already\\nquoted regarding the need of method for using our sensible\\n\\n ― 397 ―\\n                            \\ndata, he goes on to say that the \"infinitesimal analysis has\\ngiven us the means of allying physics and geometry, and\\nthat dynamics has furnished us with the key to the general\\nlaws of nature.\" It is certainly competent testimony to the\\ntruth of Leibniz\\'s fundamental principles that he foresaw\\nalso the course which the development of biological science\\nwould take. No classification based upon resemblances, says\\nLeibniz in effect, can be regarded as wholly arbitrary, since\\nresemblances are found in nature also. The only question is\\nwhether our classification is based upon superficial or°funda-mental\\nfundamental identities; the superficial resemblances being such as\\nare external, or the effects of some common cause, while the\\nfundamental resemblances are such as are the cause of°what-ever\\nwhatever other similarities are found. \"It can be said that°what-ever\\nwhatever we compare or distinguish with truth, nature°differen-tiates\\ndifferentiates, or makes agree, also; but that nature has differences\\nand identities which are better than ours, which we do not\\nknow. . . . The more we discover the generation of species,\\nand the more we follow in our classifications the conditions\\nthat are required for their production, the nearer we°ap-proach\\napproach the natural order.\" Our classifications, then, so far as\\nthey depend upon what is conditioned, are imperfect and\\nprovisional, although they cannot be said to be false (since\\n\"while nature may give us those more complete and°conven-ient\\nconvenient, it will not give the lie to those we have already\"); while\\nso far as they rest upon what is causal and conditioning,\\nthey are true, general, and necessary. In thus insisting that\\nclassification should be genetic, Leibniz anticipated the\\ngreat service which the theory of evolution has done for\\nbiological science in enabling science to form classes which\\nare \"natural\"; that is, based on identity of origin.\\nLeibniz culminates his discussion of classification as a\\nmethod of translating the empirical into the rational, by\\npointing out that it rests upon the law of continuity; and that\\nthis law contains two factors,—one equivalent to the axiom\\nof the Realists, that nature is nowhere empty; the other, to\\nthat of the Nominalists, that nature does nothing uselessly.\\n\"One of these principles seems to make nature a prodigal,\\nthe other a miser; and yet both are true if properly°under-stood\\nunderstood,\" says Leibniz. \"Nature is like a good manager,°spar-ing\\n ― 398 ―\\n                            \\nsparing where it is necessary, in order to be magnificent. It is\\nmagnificent in its effects, and economical in the causes used\\nto produce them.\" In other words, classification becomes\\nscience when it presents us with both unity and difference.\\nThe principle of unity is that of nature as a miser and\\neconomical; that of differentiation is the principle of nature\\nas prodigal and magnificent. The thoroughly differentiated\\nunity is nature as self-specifying, or as an organic, not an\\nabstract, unity.\\nThe gist of the whole matter is, then, that experience\\npresents us with an infinity of ideas, which may appear at\\nfirst sight arbitrary and accidental in their connections. This\\nappearance, however, is not the fact. These ideas are the\\neffects of certain causes; and in ascertaining these°condi-tions\\nconditions, we reduce the apparently unrelated variety of°experi-ences\\nexperiences to underlying unities, and these unities, like all real\\nunities or simple beings, are spiritual and rational in nature.\\nLeibniz\\'s ordinary way of stating this is that the principle of\\ntruths of fact is that of sufficient reason. This principle\\nLeibniz always treats as distinguished from that of identity\\n(and contradiction) as the ruling category of truths of°rea-son\\nreason. And we shall follow him in discussing the two together.\\n\"Our reasonings are based on two leading principles,\\n—that of contradiction, in virtue of which we judge false all\\nwhich contains contradiction, and true that which is opposed\\nor contradictory to that which is false; and that of sufficient\\nreason, in virtue of which we judge that no fact is true or\\nactual, no proposition veritable, unless there is a sufficient\\nreason why it is as it is, and not otherwise, although these\\nreasons are generally unknown to us. Thus there are two\\nsorts of truths,—those of reason, and those of fact. The\\ntruths of reason are necessary, and their opposites°impossi-ble\\nimpossible; while those of fact are contingent, and their opposites\\npossible. When a truth is necessary, its reason can be°dis-covered\\ndiscovered by analysis, resolving it into ideas and truths that\\nare simpler, until the primitive truths are arrived at. It is\\nthus that the mathematicians proceed in reducing by°analy-sis\\nanalysis the theorems of speculation and the canons of practice\\ninto definitions, axioms, and postulates. Thus they come to\\nsimple ideas whose definition cannot be given; primitive\\n\\n ― 399 ―\\n                            \\ntruths that cannot be proved, and which do not need it, since\\nthey are identical propositions, whose opposite contains a\\nmanifest contradiction.\"\\n\"But in contingent truths-those of fact-the sufficient\\nreason must be found; namely, in the succession of things\\nwhich fill the created universe,—for otherwise the analysis\\ninto particular reasons would go into detail without limit, by\\nreason of the immense variety of natural things, and of the\\ninfinite divisibility of bodies. There are an infinity of figures\\nand of past and present movements which enter into the\\nefficient cause of my present writing, and there are an°infin-ity\\ninfinity of minute inclinations and dispositions of my soul which\\nenter into its final cause. And since all this detail contains\\nonly other contingent and particular antecedents, each of\\nwhich has need of a similar analysis to account for it, we\\nreally make no progress by this analysis; and it is necessary\\nthat the final or sufficient reason be outside the endless\\nsuccession or series of contingent particulars, that it consist\\nin a necessary being, in which this series of changes is\\ncontained only eminenter, as in its source. This necessary\\nbeing and source is what we call God.\"\\nIn other words, the tracing of empirical facts to their\\ncauses and conditions does not, after all, render them wholly\\nrational. The series of causes is endless. Every condition is\\nin turn conditioned. We are not so much solving the°prob-lem\\nproblem of the reason of a given fact, as we are stating the\\nproblem in other terms as we go on in this series. Every\\nsolution offers itself again as a problem, and this endlessly.\\nIf these truths of fact, then, are to be rendered wholly\\nrational, it must be in something which lies outside of the\\nseries considered as a series; that is, something which is not\\nan antecedent of any one of the series, but is equally related\\nto each and to all as their ground and source. This,°consid-ered\\nconsidered as an argument for the existence of God, we shall deal\\nwith hereafter; now we are concerned only with its bearing\\nupon the relation of experience to the universality and°neces-sity\\nnecessity of knowledge. According to this, the ultimate meaning\\nof facts is found in their relation to the divine intelligence;\\nfor Leibniz is emphatic in insisting that the relation of God\\nto experience is not one of bare will to creatures produced by\\n\\n ― 400 ―\\n                            \\nthis will (as Descartes had supposed), but of a will°gov-erned\\ngoverned wholly by intelligence. As Leibniz states it in another\\nconnection, not only matters of fact, but mathematical\\ntruths, have the same final basis in the divine understanding.\\n\"Such truths, strictly speaking, are only conditional,\\nand say that in case their subject existed they would be\\nfound such and such. But if it is again asked in what consists\\nthis conditional connection in which there is necessary°real-ity\\nreality, the reply is that it is in the relation of ideas. And by the\\nfurther question, Where would be the ideas if no spirit\\nexisted; and what would then become of the foundation of\\nthe certainty of such truths?—we are brought to the final\\nfoundation of truths; namely, that supreme and universal\\nspirit, which must exist, and whose understanding is, in\\nreality, the region of the eternal truths. And in order that it\\nmay not be thought that it is not necessary to have recourse\\nto this region, we must consider that these necessary truths\\ncontain the determining reason and regulative principle of\\nexistence, and, in a word, of the laws of the universe. Thus\\nthese necessary truths, being anterior to the existences of\\ncontingent beings, must in turn be based upon the existence\\nof a necessary substance.\"\\nIt is because facts are not mere facts, in short, but are\\nthe manifestation of a \"determining reason and regulative\\nprinciple\" which finds its home in universal intelligence,\\nthat knowledge of them can become necessary and general.\\nThe general nature of truths of reason and of their\\nruling principle, identity and contradiction, has already been\\ngiven in the quotation regarding the principle of sufficient\\nreason. It is Leibniz\\'s contention that only in truths whose\\nopposite is seen to involve self-contradiction can we have\\nabsolute certainty, and that it is through connection with\\nsuch eternal truths that the certainty of our other knowledge\\nrests. It is thus evident why Leibniz insists, as against\\nLocke, upon the great importance of axioms and maxims.\\nThey are important, not merely in themselves, but as the\\nsole and indispensable bases of scientific truth regarding all\\nmatters. Leibniz at times, it is true, speaks as if°demonstra-tive\\ndemonstrative and contingent truths were of themselves, in principle,\\ndistinct, and even opposed. But he also corrects himself by\\n\\n ― 401 ―\\n                            \\nshowing that contingency is rather a subjective limitation\\nthan an objective quality. We, indeed, do not see that the\\ntruth \"I exist,\" for example, is necessary, because we cannot\\nsee how its opposite involves contradiction. But \"God sees\\nhow the two terms \\'I\\' and \\'exist\\' are connected; that is, why\\nI exist.\" So far as we can see facts, then, from the stand-\\npoint of the divine intelligence, so far, it would appear, our\\nknowledge is necessary.\\nSince these axioms, maxims, or first truths are°\"in-nate\\n\"innate,\" we are in a condition to complete (for the first time)\\nthe discussion of innate ideas. These ideas constitute, as we\\nhave learned, the essential content of the divine intelligence,\\nand of ours so far as we have realized our identity with\\nGod\\'s understanding. The highest form of knowledge,\\ntherefore, is self-consciousness. This bears the same relation\\nto necessary truths that the latter bear to experience.\\n\"Knowledge of necessary and eternal truths,\" says Leibniz,\\n\"distinguishes us from simple animals, and makes us have\\nreason and science, elevating us to the knowledge of°our-selves\\nourselves. We are thus developed to self-consciousness; and in\\nbeing conscious of ourselves we are conscious of being, of\\nsubstance, of the simple, of the spiritual, of God.\" And\\nagain he says that \"those that know necessary truths are\\nrational spirits, capable of self-consciousness, of recognizing\\nwhat is termed Ego, substance, and monad. Thus they are\\nrendered capable of demonstrative knowledge.\" \"We are\\ninnate to ourselves; and since we are beings, being is innate\\nto us, for knowledge of it is implicit in that which we have of\\nourselves.\"\\nKnowledge, in fine, may be regarded as an ascending\\nseries of four terms. The first is constituted by sensations\\nassociated together in such a way that a relation of°anteced-ence\\nantecedence and consequence exists between them. This is°\"experi-ence\\n\"experience.\" The second stage comes into existence when we\\nconnect these experiences, not by mere relations of°\"conse-cution\\n\"consecution,\" but by their conditions, by the principle of causality,\\nand especially by that of sufficient reason, which connects\\nthem with the supreme intelligence, God. This stage is\\nscience. The third is knowledge of the axioms and necessary\\ntruths in and of themselves, not merely as involved in°sci-ence\\n ― 402 ―\\n                            \\nscience. The fourth is self-consciousness, the knowledge of\\nintelligence, in its intimate and universal nature, by which\\nwe know God, the mind, and all real substance. In the order\\nof time the stage of experience is first, and that of°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness last. But in the lowest stage there are involved the\\nothers. The progress of knowledge consists in the°develop-ment\\ndevelopment or unfolding of this implicit content, till intelligence,\\nspirit, activity, is clearly revealed as the source and°condi-tion\\ncondition of all.\\n\\n ― 403 ―\\n                            \\n11: The Theology of LeibnizOne of the chapters concerning knowledge is entitled, \"The\\nKnowledge That We Have of God.\" This introduces us to\\nthe theology of Leibniz and indirectly to the completion of\\nthose ethical doctrines already outlined in the chapter on\\nwill. Leibniz employs three arguments to prove the existence\\nof God: that of God as the sufficient reason of the world\\n(substantially the cosmological proof); of God as the source\\nof the pre-established harmony (an extension of the°teleolog-ical\\nteleological proof); and the ontological. The latter he accepts as it\\ncame from the hands of Descartes, but insists that it°re-quires\\nrequires an added argument before it ranks as anything more\\nthan presumptive proof. The Anselmic-Cartesian argument,\\nas stated by Leibniz, is as follows: \"God is defined as the\\ngreatest, or most perfect, of beings, or as a being of supreme\\ngrandeur and perfection. But in the notion of a perfect\\nbeing, existence must be included, since it is something more\\nto exist than not to exist. Or existence is a perfection, and\\nhence must belong to the most perfect being; otherwise some\\nperfection would be lacking, which is contrary to the°defini-tion\\ndefinition.\" Or as Descartes sometimes puts it, in the notion of\\nanything like a tree, a mountain, a triangle, contingency is\\ncontained. We may conceive such an object to exist or not,\\nas we like. There is no necessity involved in our thought.\\nBut we cannot think of a perfect being except as existing. It\\ndoes not rest with the decision of our thinking whether or\\nnot to include existence in this notion. We must necessarily\\nthink existence as soon as we think such a being.\\nLeibniz takes a middle position, he says, between those\\nwho consider this a demonstrative argument, and those who\\nregard it as a mere paralogism. It is presupposed by this\\n\\n ― 404 ―\\n                            \\nargument that the notion of a supreme Being is possible, or\\nthat it does not involve contradiction. This presupposition is\\nto be proved. First, it is well to simplify the argument itself.\\nThe Cartesian definition may be reduced to this: \"God is a\\nbeing in whom existence and essence are one. From this\\ndefinition it follows as a corollary that such a being, if\\npossible, exists. For the essence of a thing being just that\\nwhich constitutes its possibility, it is evident that to exist by\\nits essence is the same as to exist by its possibility. Being in\\nitself, then, or God, may be most simply defined as the\\nBeing who must exist if he is possible.\"\\nThere are two ways of proving this last clause\\n(namely, that he is possible) the direct and the indirect.\\nThe indirect is employed against those who assert that from\\nmere notions, ideas, definitions or possible essences, it is not\\npossible to infer actual existence. Such persons simply deny\\nthe possibility of being in itself. But if being-in-itself, or\\nabsolute being, is impossible, being-by-another, or relative,\\nis also impossible; for there is no \"other\" upon which it may\\ndepend. Nothing, in this case, could exist. Or if necessary\\nbeing is not possible, there is no being possible. Put in\\nanother way, God is as necessary for possibility as for actual\\nexistence. If there is possibility of anything, there is God.\\nThis leads up to the direct proof; for it follows that, if there\\nbe a possibility of God,—the Being in whom existence and\\nessence are one,—he exists. \"God alone has such a position\\nthat existence is necessary, if possible. But since there can\\nbe nothing opposed to the possibility of a being without\\nlimit,—a being therefore without negations and without°con-tradiction\\ncontradiction,—this is sufficient to prove a priori the existence of\\nGod.\" In short, God being pure affirmation, pure°self-iden-tity\\nself-identity, the idea of his Being cannot include contradiction, and\\nhence is possible, and since possible, necessary. Of this\\nconception of God as the purely self-identical, without°nega-tion\\nnegation, we shall have something to say in the next chapter.\\nThe cosmological proof is, as we have already seen,\\nthat every cause in the world being at the same time an\\neffect, it cannot be the sufficient reason of anything. The\\nwhole series is contingent, and requires a ground not prior\\nto, but beyond, the series. The only sufficient reason of\\n\\n ― 405 ―\\n                            \\nanything is that which is also the sufficient reason of itself,\\n—absolute Being. The teleological argument Leibniz°invari-ably\\ninvariably, I believe, presents in connection with the idea of pre-\\nestablished harmony. \"If the substances of experience,\"\\nruns the argument, \"had not received their being, both\\nactive and passive, from one universal supreme cause, they\\nwould be independent of one another, and hence would not\\nexhibit that order, harmony, and beauty which we notice in\\nnature. This argument possesses only moral certainty which\\nbecomes demonstrative by the new kind of harmony which I\\nhave introduced,—pre-established harmony. Since each°sub-stance\\nsubstance expresses in its own way that which occurs beyond it,\\nand can have no influence on other particular beings, it is\\nnecessary that each substance, before developing these°phe-nomena\\nphenomena from the depth of its own being, must have received\\nthis nature (this internal ground of external phenomena)\\nfrom a universal cause from whom all beings depend, and\\nwhich effects that one be perfectly in accord with and°corre-sponding\\ncorresponding to every other. This cannot occur except through a\\nbeing of infinite knowledge and power.\"\\nHaving determined the existence of God, Leibniz\\nstates his attributes. These may be reduced to three. He is\\nperfect in power, in wisdom, and in goodness. \"Perfection\\nis nothing other than the whole of positive reality°sepa-rated\\nseparated from the limits and bounds of things. Where there\\nare no limits, as in God, perfection is absolutely infinite.\"\\n\"In God exists power, which is the source of all knowledge,\\n—which comprehends the realm of ideas, down to its°mi-nutest\\nminutest detail, and will, which directs all creations and\\nchanges according to the principle of the best.\" Or as he\\nexpands it at another time: \"The supreme cause must be\\nintelligent, for the existing world being contingent, and an\\ninfinity of other worlds being equally possible, it is°neces-sary\\nnecessary that the cause of the world take into consideration all\\nthese possible worlds in order to decide upon one. Now this\\nrelation of a substance to simple ideas must be the relation of\\nunderstanding to its ideas, while deciding upon one is the\\nact of will in choosing. Finally it is the power of this°sub-stance\\nsubstance which executes the volition. Power has its end in\\nbeing; wisdom, or understanding, in truth; and will in good.\\n\\n ― 406 ―\\n                            \\nThus the cause must be absolutely perfect in power,°wis-dom\\nwisdom, and goodness. His understanding is the source of°es-sences\\nessences, and his will the origin of existences.\"\\nThis brings us to the relation of God to the world, or to\\nan account of the creating activity of God. This may be\\nconsidered to be metaphysically, logically, or morally°neces-sary\\nnecessary. To say that it is metaphysically necessary is to say that\\nit is the result of the divine essence, that it would imply a\\ncontradiction of the very being of God for the world not to\\nbe and not to be as it is. In short, the world becomes a mere\\nemanation of power, since, as we have just learned, power\\nand being are correlative. But this leaves out of account the\\ndivine understanding. Not all possible worlds emanate from\\nGod\\'s being, but there is recognition of them and of their\\nrelations to one another. Were the world to proceed from the\\ndivine understanding alone, however, it would be logically\\nnecessary,—that is, it would bear the same relation to his\\nunderstanding that necessary truths do. Its opposite would\\nimply contradiction, not indeed of the being of God, but of\\nhis understanding. But the will of God plays the°all-impor-tant\\nall-important part of choosing among the alternative worlds presented\\nby reason, each of which is logically possible. One of these\\nworlds, although standing on the same intellectual plane as\\nthe others, is morally better,—that is, it involves greater\\nhappiness and perfection to the creatures constituting it.\\nGod is guided then by the idea of the better (and this is the\\nbest possible) world. His will is not arbitrary in creating: it\\ndoes not work by a fiat of brute power. But neither is it\\nfatalistic: it does not work by compulsory necessity. It is\\nboth free and necessary; free, for it is guided by naught\\nexcepting God\\'s own recognition of an end; necessary, for\\nGod, being God, cannot morally act otherwise than by the\\nprinciple of the better,—and this in contingent matters is the\\nbest. Hence the optimism of Leibniz, to which here no\\nfurther allusion can be made.\\nSince the best is precisely God himself, it is evident\\nthat the created world will have, as far as possible, his\\nperfections. It would thus be possible to deduce from this\\nconception of God and his relation to the world all those\\ncharacteristics of the Leibnizian monadology which we°for-merly\\n ― 407 ―\\n                            \\nformerly arrived at analytically. God is individual, but with an\\ninfinite comprehensiveness. Each substance repeats these\\nproperties of the supreme substance. There is an infinity of\\nsuch substances, in order that the world may as perfectly as\\npossible mirror the infinity of God. Each, so far as in it lies,\\nreflects the activity of God; for activity is the very essence of\\nperfection. And thus we might go through with the entire\\nlist of the properties of the monad.\\nTo complete the present discussion, however, it is\\nenough to notice that intelligence and will must be found in\\nevery creature, and that thus we account for the°\"appeti-tion\\n\"appetition\" and the \"perception\" that characterize even the lowest\\nmonad. The scale of monads, however, would not be as\\ncomplete as possible unless there were beings in whom°appe-tition\\nappetition became volition, and perception, self-conscious°intel-ligence\\nintelligence. Such monads will stand in quite other relation to\\nGod than the blind impulse-governed substances. \"Spirits,\"\\nsays Leibniz, \"are capable of entering into community with\\nGod, and God is related to them not only as an inventor to\\nhis machine (as he is to other creatures) but as a prince to\\nhis subjects, or, better, as a father to his children. This\\nsociety of spirits constitutes the city of God,—the most°per-fect\\nperfect state under the most perfect monarch. This city of God,\\nthis truly cosmopolitan monarchy, is a moral world within\\nthe natural. Among all the works of God it is the most\\nsublime and divine. In it consists the true glory of God, for\\nthere would be no glory of God unless his greatness and\\ngoodness were known and admired by spirits; and in his\\nrelation to this society, God for the first time reveals his\\ngoodness, while he manifests everywhere his power and\\nwisdom. And as previously we demonstrated a perfect°har-mony\\nharmony between the two realms of nature,—those of efficient\\nand final causes,—so must we here declare harmony between\\nthe physical realm of nature and the moral realm of grace,\\n—that is, between God as the architect of the mechanical\\nworld-structure, and God as the monarch of the world of\\nspirits.\" God fulfils his creation, in other words, in a realm\\nof spirits, and fulfils it because here there are beings who do\\nnot merely reflect him but who enter into relations of°com-panionship\\ncompanionship with him, forming a community. This°commu-nity\\n ― 408 ―\\n                            \\ncommunity of spirits with one another and with God is the moral\\nworld, and we are thus brought again to the ethics of°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz.\\nIt has been frequently pointed out that Leibniz was the\\nfirst to give ethics the form which it has since kept in\\nGerman philosophy,—the division into Natur-Recht and°Na-tur\\nNatur-Moral. These terms are difficult to give in English, but\\nthe latter corresponds to what is ordinarily called \"moral\\nphilosophy,\" while the former is political philosophy so far\\nas that has an ethical bearing. Or the latter may be said to\\ntreat the moral ideal and of the moral motive and of duty in\\nthemselves, while the former deals with the social, the\\npublic, and in a certain sense the external, aspects of°moral-ity\\nmorality.\\nPuffendorf undoubtedly suggested this division to\\nLeibniz by his classification of duties as external and°inter-nal\\ninternal,—the first comprehending natural and civil law, the°sec-ond\\nsecond moral theology. But Puffendorf confined the former to\\npurely external acts, excluding motives and intentions, and\\nthe latter to divine revelation. Both are \"positive,\" and in\\nsome sort arbitrary,—one resting merely on the fact that\\ncertain institutions obtain, the other on the fact that God has\\nmade certain declarations. To Leibniz, on the other hand,\\nthe will of God is in no sense the source of moral truths. The\\nwill of God does not create truth, but carries into effect the\\neternal truths of the divine understanding. Moral truths are\\nlike those of mathematics. And again, there is no such thing\\nas purely external morality: it always contains an inner\\ncontent, of which the external act is only the manifestation.\\nLeibniz may thus be said to have made two discoveries, or\\nrather re-discoveries: one, that there is a science of morals,\\nindependent of law, custom, and positive right; the other,\\nthat the basis of both \"natural\" and \"positive\" morals is not\\nthe mere will of God, but is reason with its content of eternal\\ntruths.\\nIn morals the end is happiness, the means wisdom.\\nHappiness is defined, not as an occurrence, but as a°condi-tion\\ncondition, or state of being. \"It is the condition of permanent joy.\\nThis does not mean that the joy is actually felt every°mo-ment\\nmoment, but that one is in the condition to enjoy whenever he\\n\\n ― 409 ―\\n                            \\nthinks of it, and that, in the interval, joyfulness arises from\\nhis activity and being.\" Pleasure, however, is not a state,\\nbut a feeling. It is the feeling of perfection, whether in\\nourselves or in anything else. It does not follow that we\\nperceive intellectually either in what the perfection of the\\npleasant thing consists or in what way it develops perfection\\nwithin us. It is enough that it be realized in feeling, so as to\\ngive us pleasure. Perfection is defined \"as increase of being.\\nAs sickness is, as it were, a lowering and a falling off from\\nhealth, so perfection is something which mounts above\\nhealth. It manifests itself in power to act; for all substance\\nconsists in a certain power, and the greater the power the\\nhigher and freer the substance. But power increases in the\\ndegree that the many manifests itself from one and in one,\\nwhile the one rules many from itself and transforms them\\ninto self. But unity in plurality is nothing else than°har-mony\\nharmony; and from this comes order or proportion, from which\\nproceeds beauty, and beauty awakens love. Thus it becomes\\nevident how happiness, pleasure, love, perfection, substance,\\npower, freedom, harmony, proportion, and beauty are bound\\nup in one another.\"\\nFrom this condensed sketch, taken from Leibniz°him-self\\nhimself, the main features of his ethical doctrine clearly appear.\\nWhen we were studying freedom we saw that it was not so\\nmuch a starting-point of the will as its goal and ideal. We\\nsaw also that true freedom is dependent upon knowledge,\\nupon recognition of the eternal and universal. What we have\\nhere is a statement of that doctrine in terms of feeling and of\\nwill instead of knowledge. The end of man is stated to be\\nhappiness, but the notion of happiness is developed in such a\\nway that it is seen to be equivalent to the Aristotelian notion\\nof self-realization; \"it is development of substance, and°sub-stance\\nsubstance is activity.\" It is the union of one and the many; and\\nthe one, according to the invariable doctrine of Leibniz, is\\nthe spiritual element, and the many is the real content which\\ngives meaning to this rational unity. Happiness thus means\\nperfection, and perfection a completely universalized°indi-vidual\\nindividual. The motive towards the moral life is elsewhere stated\\nto be love; and love is defined as interest in perfection, and\\nhence culminates in love of God, the only absolute°perfec-tion\\n ― 410 ―\\n                            \\nperfection. It also has its source in God, as the origin of perfection;\\nso that Leibniz says, Whoso loves God, loves all.\\nNatural right, as distinguished from morals, is based\\nupon the notion of justice, this being the outward°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of wisdom, or knowledge,—appreciation of the relation\\nof actions to happiness. The definitions given by Leibniz are\\nas follows: Just and unjust are what are useful or harmful\\nto the public,—that is, to the community of spirits. This\\ncommunity includes first God, then humanity, then the\\nstate. These are so subordinated that, in cases of collision of\\nduty, God, the universe of relations, comes before the profit\\nof humanity, and this before the state. At another time\\nLeibniz defines justice as social virtue, and says that there\\nare as many kinds of \"right\" as there are kinds of natural\\ncommunities in which happiness is an end of action. A\\nnatural community is defined as one which rests upon desire\\nand the power of satisfying it, and includes three varieties,\\n—domestic, civil, and ecclesiastic. \"Right\" is defined as that\\nwhich sustains and develops any natural community. It is, in\\nother words, the will for happiness united with insight into\\nwhat makes happiness.\\nCorresponding to the three forms of the social°organ-ism\\norganism (as we should now call the \"natural community\"), are\\nthe three kinds of jus,—jus strictum, equity, and piety. Each\\nof these has its corresponding prescript. That of jus strictum\\nis to injure no one; of equity, to render to each his own; and\\nof piety, to make the ethical law the law of conduct. Jus\\nstrictum includes the right of war and peace. The right of\\npeace exists between individuals till one breaks it. The right\\nof war exists between men and things. The victory of person\\nover thing is property. Things thus come to possess the\\nright of the person to whom they belong as against every\\nother person; that is, in the right of the person to himself as\\nagainst the attacks of another (the right to peace) is°in-cluded\\nincluded a right to his property. Jus strictum is, of course, in\\nall cases, enforceable by civil law and the compulsory force\\nwhich accompanies it. Equity, however, reaches beyond this\\nto obligation in cases where there is no right of compulsion.\\nIts law is, Be of aid to all, but to each according to his merits\\nand his claims. Finally comes piety. The other two stages\\n\\n ― 411 ―\\n                            \\nare limited. The lowest is negative, it wards off harm; the\\nsecond aims after happiness, but only within the limits of\\nearthly existence. That we should ourselves bear misery,\\neven the greatest, for the sake of others, and should subject\\nthe whole of this existence to something higher, cannot be\\nproved excepting as we regard the society, or community, of\\nour spirits with God. Justice with relation to God°compre-hends\\ncomprehends all virtues. Everything that is, is from God; and hence\\nthe law of all conduct is to use everything according to its\\nplace in the idea of God, according to its function in the\\nuniversal harmony. It thus not only complements the other\\ntwo kinds of justice but is the source of their inner ethical\\nworth. \"Strict justice\" may conflict with equity. But God\\neffects that what is of use to the public well-being—that is,\\nto the universe and to humanity—shall be of use also to the\\nindividual. Thus from the standpoint of God the moral is\\nadvantageous, and the immoral hurtful. Kant\\'s indebtedness\\nto Leibniz will at once appear to one initiated into the\\nphilosophy of the former.\\nLeibniz never worked out either his ethics or his°politi-cal\\npolitical philosophy in detail; but it is evident that they both take\\ntheir origin and find their scope in the fact of man\\'s°relation-ship\\nrelationship to God, that they are both, in fact, accounts of the\\nmethods of realizing a universal but not a merely formal\\nharmony. For harmony is not, with Leibniz, an external\\narrangement, but is the very soul of being. Perfect harmony,\\nor adaptation to the universe of relations, is the end of the\\nindividual, and man is informed of his progress towards this\\nend by an inner sentiment of pleasure.\\nIt may be added that Leibniz\\'s æsthetic theory, so far\\nas developed, rests upon the same basis as his ethical,—\\nnamely, upon membership in the \"city of God,\" or°commu-nity\\ncommunity of spiritual beings. This is implied, indeed, in a passage\\nalready quoted, where he states the close connection of\\nbeauty with harmony and perfection. The feeling of beauty\\nis the recognition in feeling of an order, proportion, and\\nharmony which are not yet intellectually descried. Leibniz\\nillustrates by music, the dance, and architecture. This°feel-ing\\nfeeling of the harmonious also becomes an impulse to produce.\\nAs perception of beauty may be regarded as unexplained, or\\n\\n ― 412 ―\\n                            \\nconfused, perception of truth, so creation of beauty may be\\nconsidered as undeveloped will. It is action on its way to\\nperfect freedom, for freedom is simply activity with explicit\\nrecognition of harmony.\\nWe cannot do better than quote the conclusion of the\\nmatter from Leibniz\\'s Principles of Nature and of Grace,\\nalthough, in part, it repeats what we have already learned.\\n\"There is something more in the rational soul, or spirit, than\\nthere is in the monad or even in the simple soul. Spirit is not\\nonly a mirror of the universe of creatures, but is also an\\nimage of the divine being. Spirit not only has a perception of\\nthe works of God, but is also capable of producing°some-thing\\nsomething which resembles them, though on a small scale. To\\nsay nothing of dreams, in which we invent without trouble\\nand without volition things upon which we must reflect a\\nlong time in order to discover in our waking state,—to say\\nnothing of this, our soul is architectonic in voluntary actions;\\nand, in discovering the sciences in accordance with which\\nGod has regulated all things (pondere, mensura, numero),\\nit imitates in its department and in its own world of activity\\nthat which God does in the macrocosm. This is the reason\\nwhy spirits, entering through reason and eternal truths into\\na kind of society with God, are members of the city of God,\\n—that is, of the most perfect state, formed and governed by\\nthe best of monarchs, in which there is no crime without\\npunishment, and no good action without reward, and where\\nthere is as much of virtue and of happiness as may possibly\\nexist. And this occurs not through a disturbance of nature,\\nas if God\\'s dealing with souls were in violation of°mechani-cal\\nmechanical laws, but by the very order of natural things, on account\\nof the eternal, pre-established harmony between the°king-doms\\nkingdoms of nature and grace, between God as monarch and\\nGod as architect, since nature leads up to grace, and grace\\nmakes nature perfect in making use of it.\"\\nNo better sentences could be found with which to\\nconclude this analysis of Leibniz. They resound not only\\nwith the grandeur and wide scope characteristic of his\\nthought, but they contain his essential idea, his pre-eminent\\n\"note,\"-that of the harmony of the natural and the°super-natural\\nsupernatural, the mechanical and the organic. The mechanical is\\n\\n ― 413 ―\\n                            \\nto Leibniz what the word signifies; it is the instrumental,\\nand this in the full meaning of the term. Nature is°instru-mental\\ninstrumental in that it performs a function, realizes a purpose, and\\ninstrumental in the sense that without it spirit, the organic,\\nis an empty dream. The spiritual, on the other hand, is the\\nmeaning, the idea of nature. It perfects it, in that it makes it\\ninstrumental to itself, and thus renders it not the passive\\npanorama of mere material force, but the manifestation of\\nliving spirit.\\n\\n ― 414 ―\\n                            \\n12: Criticism and ConclusionIn the exposition now completed we have in general taken\\nfor granted the truth and coherency of Leibniz\\'s°fundamen-tal\\nfundamental ideas, and have contented ourselves with an account of\\nthe principles and notions that flow from these ideas. The\\ntime has come for retracing our steps, and for inquiring\\nwhether the assumed premises can be thus unquestioningly\\nadopted. This final chapter, therefore, we shall devote to\\ncriticism of the basis of Leibniz\\'s philosophy, not attempting\\nto test it by a comparison with other systems, but by°inquir-ing\\ninquiring into its internal coherency, and by a brief account of the\\nways in which his successors, or at least one of them,°en-deavored\\nendeavored to make right the points in which he appeared to\\nfail.\\nThe fundamental contradiction in Leibniz is to be\\nfound, I believe, between the method which he adopted—\\nwithout inquiry into its validity and scope—and the subject-\\nmatter, or perhaps better the attitude, to which he attempted\\nto apply this method; between, that is to say, the scholastic\\nformal logic on the one hand and the idea of inter-relation\\nderived from the development of scientific thought, on the\\nother. Leibniz never thought of investigating the formal\\nlogic bequeathed by scholasticism, with a view to°determin-ing\\ndetermining its adequacy as philosophic method. He adopted, as we\\nhave seen, the principles of identity and contradiction as sole\\nprinciples of the only perfect knowledge. The type of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge is that which can be reduced to a series of identical\\npropositions, whose opposite is seen to be impossible,°be-cause\\nbecause self-contradictory. Only knowledge in this form can be\\nsaid to be demonstrative and necessary. As against Locke he\\njustified the syllogistic method of the Schoolmen as the\\ntypical method of all rational truth.\\n\\n ― 415 ―\\n                            \\nOn the other hand, Leibniz, as we saw in the earlier\\nchapters, had learned positively from the growth of science,\\nnegatively from the failures of Descartes and Spinoza, to\\nlook upon the universe as a unity of inter-related members,\\n—as an organic unity, not a mere self-identical oneness.\\nFailing to see the cause of the failures of Descartes and\\nSpinoza in precisely their adoption of the logic of identity\\nand contradiction as ultimate, he attempted to reconcile this\\nmethod with the conception of organic activity. The result is\\nconstant conflict between the method and content of his\\nphilosophy, between its letter and its spirit. The°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction is a twofold one. The unity of the content of his°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, the conception of organism or harmony, is a unity\\nwhich essentially involves difference. The unity of his\\nmethod is a formal identity which excludes it. The unity,\\nwhose discovery constitutes Leibniz\\'s great glory as a°philos-opher\\nphilosopher, is a unity of activity, a dynamic process. The unity of\\nformal logic is exclusive of any mediation or process, and is\\nessentially rigid and lifeless. The result is that Leibniz is\\nconstantly wavering (in logical result, not of course in\\nspirit) between two opposed errors, one of which is, in\\nreality, not different from Spinozism, in that it regards all\\ndistinction as only phenomenal and unreal, while the other is\\nakin to atomism, in that attempting to avoid the doctrine of\\nthe all-inclusive one, it does so only by supposing a°multi-tude\\nmultitude of unrelated units, termed monads. And thus the°har-mony\\nharmony, which in Leibniz\\'s intention is the very content of\\nreality, comes to be, in effect, an external arrangement°be-tween\\nbetween the one and the many, the unity and the distinction, in\\nthemselves incapable of real relations. Such were the results\\nof Leibniz\\'s failure, in Kantian language, to criticise his\\ncategories, in Hegelian language, to develop a logic,—the\\nresults of his assuming, without examination, the validity of\\nformal logic as a method of truth.\\nSo thoroughly is Leibniz imbued with the belief in its\\nvalidity, that the very conception, that of sufficient reason,\\nwhich should have been the means of saving him from his\\ncontradictions, is used in such a way as to plunge him\\ndeeper into them. The principle of sufficient reason may\\nindeed be used as purely formal and external,—as equivalent\\nto the notion that everything, no matter what, has some\\n ― 416 ―\\n                            \\nexplanation. Thus employed, it simply declares that°every-thing\\neverything has a reason, without in the least determining the\\nwhat of that reason,—its content. This is what we mean by\\ncalling it formal. But this is not the way in which Leibniz\\nconceives of it. According to him, it is not a principle of the\\nexternal connection of one finite, or phenomenal, fact with\\nanother. It is a principle in the light of which the whole\\nphenomenal world is to be viewed, declaring that its ground\\nand meaning are to be found in reason, in self-conscious\\nintelligence. As we have seen, it is equivalent, in Leibniz\\'s\\ncase, to the notion that we have no complete nor necessary\\nknowledge of the world of scientific fact until we have\\nreferred it to a conditioning \"Supreme Spirit.\"\\nLooked at in this way, we see that the unity which\\nLeibniz is positively employing is an organic unity, a unity\\nof intelligence involving organic reference to the known\\nworld. But such a conception of sufficient reason leaves no\\nplace for the final validity of identity and non-contradiction;\\nand therefore Leibniz, when dealing with his method, and\\nnot, as in the passages referred to, with his subject-matter,\\ncannot leave the matter thus. To do so indeed would have\\ninvolved a complete reconstruction of his philosophy,°neces-sitating\\nnecessitating a derivation of all the categories employed from\\nintelligence itself (that is, from the sufficient or conditioning\\nreason). But the bondage to scholastic method is so great\\nthat Leibniz can see no way but to measure intelligence by\\nthe ready-made principle of identity, and thus virtually\\n(though not in purpose) to explain away the very principle\\nof sufficient reason. In Leibniz\\'s words: \"Contingent truths\\nrequire an infinite analysis which only God can carry out.\\nWhence by him alone are they known a priori and°demon-stratively\\ndemonstratively. For although the reason can always be found for\\nsome occurring state in a prior state, this reason again\\nrequires a reason, and we never arrive in the series to the\\nultimate reason. But this progressus ad infinitum takes (in\\nus) the place of a sufficient reason, which can be found only\\noutside the series in God, on whom all its members, prior\\nand posterior depend, rather than upon one another.°What-ever\\nWhatever truth, therefore, is incapable of analysis, and cannot be\\ndemonstrated from its own reasons, but has its ultimate\\n ― 417 ―\\n                            \\nreason and certainty only from the divine mind, is not°neces-sary\\nnecessary. Everything that we call truths of fact come under this\\nhead, and this is the root of their contingency.\"\\nThe sentences before the one italicized repeat what we\\nhave learned before, and seem to convey the idea that the\\nphenomenal world is that which does not account for itself,\\nbecause not itself a self-determining reason, and which gets\\nits ultimate explanation and ground in a self-sufficient°rea-son\\nreason,—God. But notice the turn given to the thought with the\\nword \"therefore.\" Therefore all truth incapable of analysis,\\n—that is, of reduction to identical propositions, whose°oppo-site\\nopposite is impossible because self-contradictory,—all truth\\nwhose meaning depends upon not its bare identity, but upon\\nits relation to the very content of all intelligence, is not\\nnecessary, but contingent. Leibniz here distinctly opposes\\nidentical truths as necessary, to truth connected with reason\\nas contingent. Synthetic reference to the very structure of\\nintelligence is thus made, not the ground of truth, but a blot\\nupon its completeness and necessity. Perfect truth, it is\\nimplied in the argument, is self-identical, known by mere\\nanalysis of itself, and needs no reference to an organism of\\nreason. The reference, therefore, to a principle of sufficient\\nreason is simply a concession to the fragmentary and°imper-fect\\nimperfect condition of all knowledge. Truth in itself is°self-identi-cal\\nself-identical; but appearing to us only confusedly, we employ the idea\\nof sufficient reason as a makeshift, by which we refer, in a\\nmass, all that we cannot thus reduce to identical°proposi-tions\\npropositions, to an intelligence, or to a Deus ex machina which can\\nso reduce it. This is the lame and impotent conclusion.\\nLeibniz\\'s fundamental meaning is, no doubt, a correct\\none. He means that contingency of fact is not real, but\\napparent; that it exists only because of our inability to°pene-trate\\npenetrate the reason which would enable us completely to°ac-count\\naccount for the facts under consideration. He means that if we\\ncould understand, sub specie æternitatis, from the stand-\\npoint of universal intelligence, we should see every fact as\\nnecessary, as resulting from an intrinsic reason. But so\\nthoroughly is he fettered by the scholastic method—that is,\\nthe method of formal logic—that he can conceive of this\\nimmanent and intrinsic reason which makes every fact a\\n\\n ― 418 ―\\n                            \\ntruth—that is, self-evident in its necessity—only as an°ana-lytic\\nanalytic, self-contained identity. And herein lies his°contra-diction\\ncontradiction: his method obliges him to conceive of ultimate\\nintelligence as purely formal, simply as that which does not\\ncontradict itself, while the attitude of his thought and its\\nconcrete subject-matter compel him to think of intelligence\\nas possessing a content, as the organic unity of a system of\\nrelations.\\nFrom this contradiction flow the other contradictions of\\nLeibniz, which we are now prepared to examine in more\\ndetail. For his ideas are so much greater than his method\\nthat in almost every point there seems to be contradiction.\\nHis ideas per se mean one thing, and his ideas as interpreted\\nby his method another. Take his doctrine of individuality,\\nfor instance. To some it has appeared that the great defect of\\nthe Leibnizian philosophy is its individualism. Such conceive\\nhim simply to have carried out in his monadism the doctrine\\nof the individual isolated from the universe to its logical\\nconclusions, and thereby to have rendered it absurd. In a\\ncertain sense, the charge is true. The monad, according to\\nthe oft-repeated statement, has no intercourse with the rest\\nof the universe. It really excludes all else. It acts as if\\nnothing but itself and God were in existence. That is to say,\\nthe monad, being the self-identical, must shut out all°intrin-sic\\nintrinsic or real relations with other substances. Such relations\\nwould involve a differentiating principle for which Leibniz\\'s\\nlogic has no place. Each monad is, therefore, an isolated\\nuniverse. But such a result has no value for Leibniz. He\\nendeavors to correct it by the thought that each monad\\nideally includes the whole universe by mirroring it. And\\nthen to reconcile the real exclusion and the ideal inclusion,\\nhe falls back on a Deus ex machina who arranges a harmony\\nbetween them, foreign to the intrinsic nature of each.°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz\\'s individualism, it is claimed, thus makes of his°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy a synthesis, or rather a juxtaposition, of mutually°con-tradictory\\ncontradictory positions, each of which appears true only as long\\nas we do not attempt to think it together with the other.\\nThere is, no doubt, truth in this representation. But a\\nmore significant way of stating the matter is, I think, that\\nLeibniz\\'s defect is not in his individualism, but in the defect\\n\\n ― 419 ―\\n                            \\nof his conception of the individual. His individualism is\\nmore apparent than real. It is a negative principle, and\\nnegative in the sense of privative. The individuality of the\\nmonad is due to its incompleteness, to its imperfections. It is\\nreally matter which makes monads mutually impenetrable\\nor exclusive; it is matter which distinguishes them from\\nGod, and thus from one another. Without the material°ele-ment\\nelement they would be lost in an undistinguished identity with\\nGod, the supreme substance. But matter, it must be°remem-bered\\nremembered, is passivity; and since activity is reality, or substance,\\nmatter is unsubstantial and unreal. The same results from a\\nconsideration of knowledge. Matter is always correlative to\\nconfused ideas. With the clearing up of knowledge, with\\nmaking it rational, matter must disappear, so that to God,\\nwho is wholly reason, it must entirely vanish. But this view\\nvaries only in words from that of Spinoza, to whom it is the\\nimagination, as distinguished from the intellect, that is the\\nsource of particular and finite objects.\\nIt is perhaps in his Théodicée, in the treatment of the\\nproblem of evil, that his implicit Spinozism, or denial of\\nindividuality, comes out most clearly. That evil is negative,\\nor privative, and consists in the finitude of the creature, is\\nthe result of the discussion. What is this except to assert the\\nunreality, the merely privative character, of the finite, and to\\nresolve all into God? To take one instance out of many: he\\ncompares inertia to the original limitation of creatures, and\\nsays that as inertia is the obstacle to the complete mobility of\\nbodies, so privation, or lack, constitutes the essence of the\\nimperfection, or evil, of creatures. His metaphor is of boats\\nin the current of a river, where the heavier one goes more\\nslowly, owing to inertia. The force of the current, which is\\nthe same to all, and which is positive, suffering no°diminu-tion\\ndiminution, is comparable to the activity of God, which also is\\nperfect and positive. As the current is the positive source of\\nall the movements of the bodies, and is in no way responsible\\nfor the retardation of some boats, so God is the source only\\nof activities,—the perfections of his creatures. \"As the°iner-tia\\ninertia of the boat is the cause of its slowness, so the limitations\\nof its receptivity are the cause of the defects found in the\\naction of creatures.\" Individuality is thus reduced to mere\\n\\n ― 420 ―\\n                            \\nlimitation; and the unlimited, the real which includes all\\nreality, is God. We are thus placed in a double difficulty.\\nThis notion of an all-inclusive one contradicts the reality of\\nmutually exclusive monads; and we have besides the°charac-teristic\\ncharacteristic difficulty of Spinoza,—how, on the basis of this°un-limited\\nunlimited, self-identical substance, to account for even the\\nappearance of finitude, plurality and individuality.\\nLeibniz\\'s fundamental defect may thus be said to be\\nthat, while he realized, as no one before him had done, the\\nimportance of the conception of the negative, he was yet\\nunable to grasp the significance of the negative, was led to\\ninterpret it as merely privative or defective, and thus,°fi-nally\\nfinally, to surrender the very idea. Had not his method, his\\npresupposition regarding analytic identity, bound him so\\ncompletely in its toils, his clear perception that it was the\\nnegative element that differentiated God from the universe,\\nintelligence from matter, might have brought him to a°gen-eral\\ngeneral anticipation not only of Kant, but of Hegel. But instead\\nof transforming his method by this conception of negation,\\nhe allowed his assumed (i.e., dogmatic) method to evacuate\\nhis conception of its significance. It was Hegel who was\\nreally sufficiently in earnest with the idea to read it into the\\nvery notion of intelligence as a constituent organic element,\\nnot as a mere outward and formal limitation.\\nWe have already referred to the saying of Leibniz that\\nthe monad acts as if nothing existed but God and itself. The\\nsame idea is sometimes expressed by saying that God alone\\nis the immediate or direct object of the monad. Both°expres-sions\\nexpressions mean that, while the monad excludes all other monads,\\nsuch is not the case in its relation to God, but that it has an\\norganic relation with him. We cannot keep from asking\\nwhether there is not another aspect of the contradiction here.\\nHow is it possible for the monad so to escape from its\\nisolation that it can have communication with God more\\nthan with other substances? Or if it can have communication\\nwith God, why cannot it equally bear real relations of°com-munity\\ncommunity with other monads? And the answer is found in\\nLeibniz\\'s contradictory conceptions of God. Of these°concep-tions\\nconceptions there are at least three. When Leibniz is emphasizing\\nhis monadic theory, with its aspects of individuality and\\n\\n ― 421 ―\\n                            \\nexclusion, God is conceived as the highest monad, as one in\\nthe series of monads, differing from the others only in the\\ndegree of its activity. He is the \"monad of monads\"; the\\nmost complete, active, and individualized of all. But it is\\nevident that in this sense there can be no more intercourse\\nbetween God and a monad than there is between one monad\\nand another. Indeed, since God is purus actus without any\\npassivity, it may be said that there is, if possible, less°com-munication\\ncommunication in this case than in the others. He is, as Leibniz\\nsays, what a monad without matter would be, \"a deserter\\nfrom the general order.\" He is the acme of isolation. This,\\nof course, is the extreme development of the \"individual\"\\nside of Leibniz\\'s doctrine, resulting in a most pronounced\\natomism. Leibniz seems dimly conscious of this difficulty,\\nand thus by the side of this notion of God he puts another.\\nAccording to it, God is the source of all monads. The\\nmonads are not created by a choice of the best of all possible\\nworlds, as his official theology teaches, but are the radiations\\nof his divinity. Writing to Bayle, Leibniz expresses himself\\nas follows: \"The nature of substance consists in an active\\nforce of definite character, from which phenomena proceed\\nin orderly succession. This force was originally received by,\\nand is indeed preserved to, every substance by the creator of\\nall things, from whom all actual forces or perfections°ema-nate\\nemanate by a sort of continual creation.\" And in his Monadology\\nhe says: All \"the created or derived monads are the°produc-tions\\nproductions of God, and are born, as it were, by the continual\\nfulgurations of the divinity from instant to instant, bounded\\nby the receptivity of the creature to which it is essential to be\\nlimited.\" What has become of the doctrine of monads°(al-though\\n(although the word is retained) it would be difficult to say.\\nThere is certainly no individual distinction now between the\\ncreated monads and God, and it is impossible to see why\\nthere should be individual distinctions between the various\\ncreated monads. They appear to be all alike, as modes of the\\none comprehensive substance. Here we have the universal,\\nor \"identity,\" side of Leibniz\\'s philosophy pushed to its\\nlogical outcome,—the doctrine of pantheism.\\nHis third doctrine of God is really a unity of the two\\nprevious. It is the doctrine that God is the harmony of the\\n\\n ― 422 ―\\n                            \\nmonads,—neither one among them nor one made up of them,\\nbut their organic unity. This doctrine is nowhere expressly\\nstated in words (unless it be when he says that \"God alone\\nconstitutes the relation and community of substances\"), but\\nit runs through his whole system. According to this, God is\\nthe pre-established harmony. This conception, like that of\\nharmony, may have either a mechanical interpretation°(ac-cording\\n(according to which God is the artificial, external point of\\ncontact of intelligence and reality, in themselves opposed) or\\nan organic meaning, according to which God is the unity of\\nintelligence and reality. On this interpretation alone does the\\nsaying that God is the only immediate object of the monads\\nhave sense. It simply states that the apparent dualism°be-tween\\nbetween intelligence and its object which is found in the world\\nis overcome in God; that the distinction between them is not\\nthe ultimate fact, but exists in and for the sake of a unity\\nwhich transcends the difference. According to this view, the\\nopposition between ideal inclusion and real exclusion°van-ishes\\nvanishes. God is the harmony of the real and ideal, not a mere\\narrangement for bringing them to an understanding with\\none another. Individuality and universality are no longer\\nopposed conceptions, needing a tertium quid to relate them,\\nbut are organic factors of reality, and this, at the same time,\\nis intelligence.\\nBut admitting this conception as stating the implicit\\nintention of Leibniz, the relation of monads to one another\\nis wholly different from that which Leibniz gives. And to\\nthis point we now come. If in God, the absolute, the real and\\nthe ideal are one, it is impossible that in substances, which\\nhave their being and significance only in relation to God, or\\nthis unity, the real and the ideal should be so wholly°sep-arated\\nseparated as Leibniz conceives.\\nLeibniz\\'s conception relative to this is, as we have seen,\\nthat there is no physical influxus, or commercium, of°mo-nads\\nmonads, but ideal consensus. Really each shuts out every other;\\nideally, or representatively, it includes every other. His°posi-tive\\npositive thought in the matter is that a complete knowledge of\\nany portion of the universe would involve a perfect°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of the whole, so organic is the structure of the universe.\\nEach monad sums up the past history of the world, and is\\n\\n ― 423 ―\\n                            \\nbig with its future. This is the conception of inter-relation;\\nthe conception of all in one, and one as a member, not a part\\nof a whole. It is the conception which Leibniz brought to\\nbirth, the conception of the thorough unity of the world. In\\nthis notion there is no denial of community of relation; it is\\nrather the culmination of relation. There is no isolation. But\\naccording to his presupposed logic, individuality can mean\\nonly identity excluding distinction,—identity without°intrin-sic\\nintrinsic relation, and, as Leibniz is bound at all hazards to save\\nthe notion of individuality, he is obliged to think of this\\ninter-relation as only ideal, as the result of a predetermined\\ntendency given at its creation to the self-identical monad by\\nGod. But of course Leibniz does not escape the contradiction\\nbetween identity and distinction, between individuality and\\nuniversality, by this means. He only transfers it to another\\nrealm. In the relation of the monad to God the diversity of\\nits content, the real or universal element, is harmonized with\\nthe identity of its law, its ideal or individual factor. But if\\nthese elements do not conflict here, why should they in the\\nrelation of the monads to one another? Either there is°al-ready\\nalready an immanent harmony between the individual and\\nuniversal, and no external arrangement is needed to bring it\\nabout, or there is no such harmony, and therefore no relation\\npossible between God and the individual monad. One side of\\nthe Leibnizian philosophy renders the other side impossible.\\nAnother consequence of Leibniz\\'s treatment of the°neg-ative\\nnegative as merely limitative is that he can find no distinction,\\nexcepting of degree, between nature and spirit. Such a°con-ception\\nconception is undoubtedly in advance of the Cartesian dualism,\\nwhich regards them as opposed realms without any relation;\\nbut it may be questioned whether it is as adequate a view as\\nthat which regards them as distinct realms on account of\\nrelation. At all events, it leads to confusion in Leibniz\\'s\\ntreatment of both material objects and self-conscious°person-alities\\npersonalities. In the former case his method of escape is a°meta-phor\\nmetaphor,—that objects apparently material are full of souls, or\\nspirits. This may mean that the material is merely material\\nonly when considered in implicit abstraction from the°intelli-gence\\nintelligence which conditions it, that the material, in truth, is\\nconstituted by some of the relations which in their°complete-ness\\n ― 424 ―\\n                            \\ncompleteness make up intelligence. This at least bears a consistent\\nmeaning. But it is not monadism; it is not the doctrine that\\nmatter differs from spirit only in degree: it is the doctrine\\nthat they differ in kind, as the conditioned from the°condi-tioning\\nconditioning. At times, however, Leibniz attempts to carry out his\\nmonadism literally, and the result is that he conceives matter\\nas being itself endowed, in some unexplained way, with\\nsouls, or since this implies a dualism between matter and\\nsoul, of being made up, composed, of souls. But as he is\\nobliged to explain that this composition is not spatial, or\\nphysical, but only ideal, this doctrine tends to resolve itself\\ninto the former. And thus we end where we began,—with a\\nmetaphor.\\nOn the other hand there is a wavering treatment of the\\nnature of spirit. At times it is treated as precisely on a level\\nin kind with the monads that \"compose\" matter, differing\\nonly in the greater degree of its activity. But at other times it\\nis certainly represented as standing on another plane. \"The\\ndifference between those monads which express the world\\nwith consciousness and those which express it°unintelli-gently\\nunintelligently is as great as the difference between a mirror and one\\nwho sees.\" If Leibniz means what he seems to imply by\\nthese words, it is plainly asserted that only the spiritual\\nbeing is worthy of being called a monad, or individual, at\\nall, and that material being is simply a dependent°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of spirit. Again he says: \"Not all entelechies are, like\\nour soul, images of God,—being made as members of a\\nsociety or state of which he is chief,—but all are images of\\nthe universe.\" In this distinction between self-conscious\\nbeings as images of God and unconscious monads as images\\nof the universe there is again implied a difference of kind.\\nThat something is the image of the universe need mean only\\nthat it cannot be explained without its relations to the°uni-verse\\nuniverse. To say that something is the image of God, must\\nmean that it is itself spiritual and self-conscious. God alone\\nis reason and activity. He alone has his reality in himself.\\nSelf-conscious beings, since members of a community with\\nhim, must participate in this reality in a way different in\\nkind from those things which, at most, are only substances\\nor objects, not subjects.\\n\\n ― 425 ―\\n                            \\nNor do the difficulties cease here. If matter be°con-ceived\\nconceived, not as implied in the relations by which reason is\\nrealized in constituting the universe, but as itself differing\\nfrom reason only in degree, it is impossible to account for its\\nexistence. Why should a less degree of perfection exist than\\nis necessary? Why should not the perfect activity, God,\\ncomplete the universe in himself? Leibniz\\'s answer that an\\ninfinity of monads multiplies his existence so far as possible,\\nmay hold indeed of other spirits, who mirror him and live in\\none divine society, but is utterly inapplicable to those which\\nfail to image him. Their existence, as material, is merely\\nprivative; it is merely the absence of the activity found in\\nconscious spirit. How can this deprivation, this limitation,\\nincrease in any way the harmony and perfection of the\\nuniverse? Leibniz\\'s theory of the negative, in fine, compels\\nhim to put nature and spirit on the same level, as differing\\nonly in degree. This, so far from giving nature a reality,\\nresults in its being swallowed up in spirit, not as necessarily\\ndistinct from it and yet one with it, but as absorbed in it,\\nsince the apparent difference is only privative. Nor does the\\ntheory insure the reality of spirit. This, since one in kind\\nwith matter, is swallowed up along with it in the one°sub-stance\\nsubstance, which is positive and self-identical,—in effect, the\\nDeus sive Natura of Spinoza.\\nWe have to see that this contradiction on the side of\\nexistence has its correlate on the side of knowledge, and our\\nexamination of this fundamental deficiency in Leibniz is\\nended. Sensation is on the side of intelligence what matter is\\non the side of reality. It is confused knowledge, as matter is\\nimperfect activity or reality. Knowledge is perfect only\\nwhen it is seen to be necessary, and by \"necessary\" is meant\\nthat whose opposite is impossible, or involves contradiction.\\nIn spite, therefore, of Leibniz\\'s thorough conviction that\\n\"matters of fact\"—the subject-matter of physical science—\\nare not arbitrary, he is yet obliged finally to agree with\\nLocke that there is no certainty to be found in such°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, either as a whole or in any of its details. The element\\nof sensation, of confused knowledge, cannot be eliminated.\\nHence it must always be open to any one to object that it is\\nonly on account of this imperfect factor of our knowledge\\n\\n ― 426 ―\\n                            \\nthat there appears to be a physical world at all, that the\\nexternal world is an illusion produced by our sensations.\\nAnd Leibniz himself, while claiming that the world of fact,\\nas opposed to the realm of relations, possesses practical\\nreality, is obliged to admit that metaphysically it may be\\nonly an orderly dream. The fact is that Leibniz°uncon-sciously\\nunconsciously moves in the same circle, with relation to sensation\\nand the material world, that confines Spinoza with regard to\\nimagination and particular multiple existences. Spinoza°ex-plains\\nexplains the latter from that imperfection of our intelligence\\nwhich leads us to imagine rather than to think. But he\\naccounts for the existence of imagination, when he comes to\\ntreat that, as due to the plurality of particular things. So\\nLeibniz, when an account of the existence of matter is°de-manded\\ndemanded of him, refers to confused knowledge as its source,\\nwhile in turn he explains the latter, or sensation, from the\\nmaterial element which sets bounds to the activity of spirit.\\nLeibniz seems indeed, to advance upon Spinoza in admitting\\nthe reality of the negative factor in differentiating the purely\\nself-identical, but he gives up what he has thus gained by\\ninterpreting the negation as passivity, or mere deprivation.\\nTo sum up, it may be doubted whether we have more\\nto learn from Leibniz\\'s successes or from his failures.°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz\\'s positive significance for us is in his clear recognition of\\nthe problems of modern philosophy, and in his perception of\\nthe isolated elements of their solution. His negative°signifi-cance\\nsignificance is in his clinging to a method which allowed him only\\nto juxtapose these elements without forming of them a true\\nsynthesis. There are a number of sides from which we may\\nstate Leibniz\\'s realization of the problem. Perhaps that\\nwhich distinguishes Leibniz most clearly from Locke is\\ntheir respective treatments of the relation of the physical to\\nthe spiritual, or, as the question presented itself mainly to\\nthem, of the \"natural\" to the \"supernatural.\" To Locke the\\nsupernatural was strictly miraculous; it was, from our stand-\\npoint, mere power, or will. It might indeed be rational, but\\nthis reason was incapable of being apprehended by us. Its\\ndistinction from the finite was so great that it could be\\nconceived only as something preceding and succeeding the\\nfinite in time, and meanwhile as intercalating itself°arbitrar-ily\\n ― 427 ―\\n                            \\narbitrarily here and there into the finite; as, for example, in the\\nrelation of soul and body, in the production of sensation, etc.\\nIn a word, Locke thought that the ends of philosophy, and\\nwith it of religion and morals, could be attained only by a\\ncomplete separation of the \"natural\" and the°\"supernatu-ral\\n\"supernatural.\" Leibniz, on the other hand, conceived the aim of°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy to be the demonstration of their harmony. This is\\nevidenced by his treatment of the relations of the infinite and\\nfinite, of matter and spirit, of mechanical and final°causa-tion\\ncausation. And he found the sought-for harmony in the fact that\\nthe spiritual is the reason, purpose, and function of the\\nnatural. The oft-quoted words of Lotze express the thought\\nof Leibniz: \"The mechanical is unbounded in range, but is\\nsubordinate in value.\" We cannot find some things that\\noccur physically, and others that occur supernaturally;°ev-erything\\neverything that occurs has its sufficient mechanical°anteced-ents\\nantecedents, but all that occurs has its significance, its purpose, in\\nsomething that does not occur, but that eternally is—Reason.\\nThe mechanical and the spiritual are not realms which here\\nand there come into outward contact. They are related as the\\nconditioned and the conditioning. That, and not the idea of\\nan artificial modus vivendi, is the true meaning of the°pre-es-tablished\\npre-established harmony.\\nIn other words, Leibniz\\'s great significance for us is\\nthe fact that, although he accepted in good faith, and indeed\\nas himself a master in its methods, the results and principles\\nof physical science, he remained a teleological idealist of the\\ntype of Aristotle. But I have not used the right words. It was\\nnot in spite of his acceptance of the scientific view of the\\nworld that he retained his faith in the primacy of purpose\\nand reason. On the contrary, he was an idealist because of\\nhis science, because only by the idea of an all-conditioning\\nspiritual activity could he account for and make valid°scien-tific\\nscientific conceptions; he was a teleologist, because natural°proc-esses\\nprocesses, with their summing up in the notion of causality, were\\nmeaningless except as manifesting an immanent purpose.\\nThere are other more technical ways of stating the\\nbearing of Leibniz\\'s work. We may say that he realized that\\nthe problem of philosophy consisted in giving due value to\\nthe notions of individuality and universality, of identity and\\n\\n ― 428 ―\\n                            \\ndifference, or of the real and the ideal. In developing these\\nideas, however, we should only be repeating what has°al-ready\\nalready been said, and so we may leave the matter here. On\\nthe negative side we need only recall what was said a few\\npages back regarding the incompatibility of Leibniz\\'s\\nmethod-the scholastic formal logic—with the content of his\\nphilosophy. The attempt to find a formal criterion of truth\\nwas hopeless; it was worse than fruitless, for it led to such an\\ninterpretation of concrete truths as to deprive them of their\\nsignificance and as to land Leibniz in involved°contradic-tions\\ncontradictions.\\nTo write a complete account of the influence of°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz\\'s philosophy would be too large a task for these pages. If\\nwe were to include under this head all the ramifications of\\nthought to which Leibniz stimulated, directly and indirectly,\\neither by stating truths which some one worked out or by\\nstating errors which incited some one to new points of view,\\nwe should have to sketch German philosophy since his time,\\n—and not only the professional philosophy, but those wide\\naspects of thought which were reflected in Herder, Lessing,\\nand Goethe. It is enough to consider him as the forerunner\\nof Kant. It has become so customary to represent Kant as\\nworking wholly on the problem which Hume presented, that\\nhis great indebtedness to Leibniz is overlooked. Because\\nHume aroused Kant from his dogmatic slumbers, it is°sup-posed\\nsupposed that Kant threw off the entire influence of the°Leib-nizian\\nLeibnizian thought as vain dreams of his sleep. Such a°represen-tation\\nrepresentation is one-sided. It is truer to state that Hume challenged\\nKant to discover the method by which he could justify the\\nresults of Leibniz. In this process, the results, no doubt, took\\non a new form: results are always relative to method; but\\nKant never lost sight of the results. In the main, he accepted\\nthe larger features of the Leibnizian conclusions, and,\\ntaught by Hume of the insufficiency of the method that\\nLeibniz followed, searched for a method which should°guar-antee\\nguarantee them.\\nThis aspect of Kant appears more fully in his lesser\\nand somewhat controversial writings than in his classic\\nworks; and this, no doubt, is one reason that his°indebted-ness\\nindebtedness is so often overlooked. His close relation to Leibniz\\nappears most definitely in his brochure entitled Concerning\\n ― 429 ―\\n                            \\na Discovery which Renders Unnecessary all Critique of Pure\\nReason. A Wolffian, Eberhard by name, had \"made the\\ndiscovery\" (to use Kant\\'s words) \"that the Leibnizian°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy contained a critique of reason just as well as the\\nmodern, and accordingly contained everything that is true in\\nthe latter, and much else in addition.\" In his reply to this\\nwriting, Kant takes the position that those who claimed to\\nbe Leibnizians simply repeated the words of Leibniz without\\npenetrating into his spirit, and that consequently they°mis-represented\\nmisrepresented him on every important point. He, Kant, on the\\nother hand, making no claim to use the terminology of\\nLeibniz, was his true continuator, since he had only changed\\nthe doctrine of the latter so as to make it conform to the true\\nintent of Leibniz, by removing its self-contradictions. He\\ncloses: \"\\'The Critique of Pure Reason\\' may be regarded as\\nthe real apology for Leibniz, even against his own professed\\nfollowers.\"\\nKant, in particular, names three points in which he is\\nthe true follower of Leibniz. The professed disciples of the\\nlatter insisted that the law of sufficient reason was an°objec-tive\\nobjective law, a law of nature. But, says Kant, it is so notorious,\\nso self-evident, that no one can make a new discovery\\nthrough this principle, that Leibniz can have meant it only\\nas subjective. \"For what does it mean to say that over and\\nabove the principle of contradiction another principle must\\nbe employed? It means this: that, according to the principle\\nof contradiction, only that can be known which is already\\ncontained in the notion of the object; if anything more is to\\nbe known, it must be sought through the use of a special\\nprinciple, distinct from that of contradiction. Since this\\nlast kind of knowledge is that of synthetic principles,°Leib-niz\\nLeibniz means just this: besides the principle of contradiction, or\\nthat of analytic judgments, there must be another, that of\\nsufficient reason, for synthetic judgments. He thus pointed\\nout, in a new and remarkable manner, that certain°investiga-tions\\ninvestigations in metaphysics were still to be made.\" In other words,\\nKant, by his distinction of analytic and synthetic judgments,\\nwith their respective principles and spheres, carried out the\\nidea of Leibniz regarding the principles of contradiction and\\nsufficient reason.\\nThe second point concerns the relation of monads to\\n\\n ― 430 ―\\n                            \\nmaterial bodies. Eberhard, like the other professed°Leibnizi-ans\\nLeibnizians, interpreted Leibniz as saying that corporeal bodies, as\\ncomposite, are actually made up out of monads, as simple.\\nKant, on the other hand, saw clearly that Leibniz was not\\nthinking of a relation of composition, but of condition. \"He\\ndid not mean the material world, but the substrate, the\\nintellectual world which lies in the idea of reason, and in\\nwhich everything must be thought as consisting of simple\\nsubstances.\" Eberhard\\'s process, he says, is to begin with\\nsense-phenomena, to find a simple element as a part of the\\nsense-perceptions, and then to present this simple element as\\nif it were spiritual and equivalent to the monad of Leibniz.\\nKant claims to follow the thought of Leibniz in regarding\\nthe simple not as an element in the sensuous, but as°some-thing\\nsomething super-sensuous, the ground of the sensuous. Leibniz\\'s\\nmistake was that, not having worked out clearly the°respec-tive\\nrespective limits of the principles of identity and of sufficient\\nreason, he supposed that we had a direct intellectual°intui-tion\\nintuition of this super-sensuous, when in reality it is unknowable.\\nThe third group of statements concerns the principle of\\npre-established harmony. \"Is it possible,\" asks Kant, \"that\\nLeibniz meant by this doctrine to assert the mere°coinci-dence\\ncoincidence of two substances wholly independent of each other by\\nnature, and incapable through their own force of being\\nbrought into community?\" And his answer is that what\\nLeibniz really implied was not a harmony between°inde-pendent\\nindependent things, but a harmony between modes of knowing,\\nbetween sense on the one hand and understanding on the\\nother. The Critique of Pure Reason carried the discussion\\nfarther by pointing out its grounds; namely, that, without\\nthe unity of sense and understanding, no experience would\\nbe possible. Why there should be this harmony, why we\\nshould have experience, this question it is impossible to\\nanswer, says Kant,—adding that Leibniz confessed as much\\nwhen he called it a \"pre-established\" harmony, thus not\\nexplaining it, but only referring it to a highest cause. That\\nLeibniz really means a harmony within intelligence, not a\\nharmony of things by themselves, is made more clear,°ac-cording\\naccording to Kant, from the fact that it is applied also to the\\nrelation between the kingdom of nature and of grace, of final\\n\\n ― 431 ―\\n                            \\nand of efficient causes. Here the harmony is clearly not\\nbetween two independently existing external things, but°be-tween\\nbetween what flows from our notions of nature°(Naturbegrif-fe\\n(Naturbegriffe) and of freedom (Freiheitsbegriffe); that is, between two\\ndistinct powers and principles within us,—an agreement\\nwhich can be explained only through the idea of an°intelli-gent\\nintelligent cause of the world.\\nIf we review these points in succession, the influence of\\nLeibniz upon Kant becomes more marked. As to the first\\none, it is well known that Kant\\'s philosophy is based upon,\\nand revolves within, the distinction of analytic and synthetic\\njudgments; and this distinction Kant clearly refers to the\\nLeibnizian distinction between the principles of°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction and of sufficient reason, or of identity and°differentia-tion\\ndifferentiation. It is not meant that Kant came to this thought through\\nthe definitions of Leibniz; on the contrary, Kant himself\\nrefers it to Hume\\'s distinction between matters of fact and\\nrelations of ideas. But when Kant had once generalized the\\nthought of Hume, it fell at once, as into ready prepared\\nmoulds, into the categories of Leibniz. He never escapes\\nfrom the Leibnizian distinction. In his working of it out\\nconsists his greatness as the founder of modern thought;\\nfrom his acceptance of it as ultimate result his°contradic-tions\\ncontradictions. That is to say, Kant did not merely receive the vague\\nidea of sufficient reason: he so connected it with what he\\nlearned from Hume that he transformed it into the idea of\\nsynthesis, and proceeded to work out the conception of°syn-thesis\\nsynthesis in the various notions of the understanding, or°catego-ries\\ncategories, as applicable to the material of sense. What Leibniz\\nbequeathed him was the undefined idea that knowledge of\\nmatters of fact rests upon the principle of sufficient reason.\\nWhat Kant did with this inheritance was to identify the\\nwholly vague idea of sufficient reason with the notion that\\nevery fact of experience rests upon necessary synthetic\\nconnection,—that is, connection according to notions of\\nunderstanding with other facts,—and to determine, so far\\nas he could, the various forms of synthesis, or of sufficient\\nreason. With Leibniz the principle remained essentially\\ninfertile, because it was the mere notion of the ultimate\\nreference of experience to understanding. In the hands of\\n\\n ― 432 ―\\n                            \\nKant it became the instrument of revolutionizing°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, because Kant showed the articulate members of°under-standing\\nunderstanding by which experience is constituted, and described\\nthem in the act of constituting.\\nSo much for his working out of the thought. But on the\\nother hand, Kant never transcended the absoluteness of the\\ndistinction between the principles of synthesis and analysis,\\nof sufficient reason and contradiction. The result was that he\\nregarded the synthetic principle as the principle only of our\\nknowledge, while perfect knowledge he still considered to\\nfollow the law of identity, of mere analysis. He worked out\\nthe factor of negation, of differentiation, contained in the\\nnotion of synthesis, but limited it to synthesis upon material\\nof sense, presupposing that there is another kind of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, not limited to sense, not depending upon the synthetic\\nprinciple, but resting upon the principle of contradiction, or\\nanalysis, and that this kind is the type, the norm, of the only\\nperfect knowledge. In other words, while admitting the\\nsynthetic principle of differentiation as a necessary element\\nwithin our knowledge, he held that on account of this°ele-ment\\nelement our knowledge is limited to the phenomenal realm.\\nLeibniz\\'s error was in supposing that the pure principles of\\nthe logical understanding, resting on contradiction, could\\ngive us knowledge of the noumenal world; his truth was in\\nsupposing that only by such principles could they be known.\\nThus, in substance, Kant. Like Leibniz, in short, he failed to\\ntranscend the absoluteness of the value of the scholastic\\nmethod; but he so worked out another and synthetic method,\\n—the development of the idea of sufficient reason,—that he\\nmade it necessary for his successors to transcend it.\\nThe second point concerns the relations of the sensuous\\nand the super-sensuous. Here, besides setting right the°ordi-nary\\nordinary misconception of Leibniz, Kant did nothing but render\\nhim consistent with himself. Leibniz attempted to prove the\\nexistence of God, as we have seen, by the principles both of\\nsufficient reason and contradiction. Kant denies the validity\\nof the proof by either method. God is the sufficient cause, or\\nreason, of the contingent sense world. But since Leibniz\\nadmits that this contingent world may, after all, be but a\\ndream, how shall we rise from it to the notion of God? It is\\n\\n ― 433 ―\\n                            \\nnot our dreams that demonstrate to us the existence of\\nreality. Or, again, sense-knowledge is confused knowledge.\\nHow shall this knowledge, by hypothesis imperfect,°guaran-tee\\nguarantee to us the existence of a perfect being? On the other hand,\\nsince the synthetic principle, or that of sufficient reason, is\\nnecessary to give us knowledge of matters of fact, the°princi-ple\\nprinciple of contradiction, while it may give us a consistent and\\neven necessary notion of a supreme Being, cannot give this\\nnotion reality. Leibniz, while admitting, with regard to all\\nother matters of fact, that the principles of formal logic can\\ngive no unconditional knowledge, yet supposes that, with\\nregard to the one unconditional reality, they are amply°suffi-cient\\nsufficient. Kant but renders him self-consistent on this point.\\nIt is, however, with regard to the doctrine of°pre-estab-lished\\npre-established harmony that Kant\\'s large measure of indebtedness to\\nLeibniz is most apt to be overlooked. Kant\\'s claim that\\nLeibniz himself meant the doctrine in a subjective sense\\n(that is, of a harmony between powers in our own°intelli-gence\\nintelligence) rather than objective (or between things out of°rela-tion\\nrelation to intelligence) seems, at first sight, to go far beyond\\nthe mark. However, when we recall that to Leibniz the sense\\nworld is only the confused side of rational thought, there is\\nmore truth in Kant\\'s saying than appears at this first sight.\\nThe harmony is between sense and reason. But it may at\\nleast be said without qualification that Kant only translated\\ninto subjective terms, terms of intelligence, what appears in\\nLeibniz as objective. This is not the place to go into the\\ndetails of Kant\\'s conception of the relation of the material to\\nthe psychical, of the body and soul. We may state, however,\\nin his own words, that \"the question is no longer as to the\\npossibility of the association of the soul with other known\\nand foreign substances outside it, but as to the connection of\\nthe presentations of inner sense with the modifications of our\\nexternal sensibility.\" It is a question, in short, of the°har-mony\\nharmony of two modes of our own presentation, not of the\\nharmony of two independent things. And Kant not only thus\\ndeals with the fact of harmony, but he admits, as its possible\\nsource, just what Leibniz claims to be its actual source;\\nnamely, some one underlying reality, which Leibniz calls\\nthe monad, but to which Kant gives no name. \"I can well\\n\\n ― 434 ―\\n                            \\nsuppose,\" says Kant, \"that the substance to which through\\nexternal sense extension is attributed, is also the subject of\\nthe presentations given to us by its inner sense: thus that\\nwhich in one respect is called material being would be in\\nanother respect thinking being.\"\\nKant treats similarly the problem of the relations of\\nphysical and final causes, of necessity and freedom. Here, as\\nin the case just mentioned, his main problem is to discover\\ntheir harmony. His solution, again, is in the union, in our\\nintelligence, of the understanding-as the source of the°no-tions\\nnotions which \"make nature\"-with the ideas of that reason\\nwhich gives a \"categorical imperative.\" The cause of the\\npossibility of this harmony between nature and freedom,\\nbetween the sense world and the rational, he finds in a\\nbeing, God, whose sole function in the Kantian philosophy\\nmay be said to be to \"pre-establish\" it. I cannot believe that\\nKant, in postulating the problems of philosophy as the°har-mony\\nharmony of sense and understanding, of nature and freedom,\\nand in finding this harmony where he did, was not°pro-foundly\\nprofoundly influenced, consciously as well as unconsciously, by\\nLeibniz. In fact, I do not think that we can understand the\\nnature either of Kant\\'s immense contributions to modern\\nthought or of his inconsistencies, until we have traced them\\nto their source in the Leibnizian philosophy,—admitting, on\\nthe other hand, that we cannot understand why Kant should\\nhave found necessary a new way of approach to the results\\nof Leibniz, until we recognize to the full his indebtedness to\\nHume. It was, indeed, Hume that awoke him to his°endeav-ors\\nendeavors, but it was Leibniz who set before him the goal of these\\nendeavors. That the goal should appear somewhat°trans-formed\\ntransformed, when approached from a new point of view, was to\\nbe expected. But alas! the challenge from Hume did not\\nwholly awaken Kant. He still accepted without question the\\nvalidity of the scholastic method,—the analytic principle of\\nidentity as the type of perfect knowledge,—although°deny-ing\\ndenying its sufficiency for human intelligence.

       "  'text: ': '\\n\\nDiscussions regarding materialism have been, for the most\\npart, confined to the physiological and psychological aspects\\nof it. Its supporters and opponents have been content to\\nadduce arguments pro or con, as the facts of physical and\\nmental life bear upon the case in hand. It is the object of the\\npresent paper to discuss its metaphysical phases.\\nHume suggested that possibly one might escape from\\nthe nihilistic consequences of his philosophy by means of\\n\"the sceptical solution of sceptical doubts.\" In a somewhat\\nanalogous manner we would attempt to render explicit the\\nmetaphysical assumptions (i.e., assumptions regarding the\\nreal nature of things) latent in all materialism, and, by\\nshowing the relation of these fundamental assumptions to\\nmaterialism itself, show the self-destructive character of\\nevery scheme of this kind—whether actual or possible.\\nWhat is materialism? It is that theory which declares\\nthat matter and its forces adequately account for all\\nphenomena-those of the material world, commonly so called, and\\nthose of life, mind, and society. It declares that not only the\\ncontent of mind, but that which we call mind itself, is\\ndetermined by matter. We notice first, then, that it is\\nabsolutely monistic. But one substance exists-matter. All\\nphenomena of mind are really phenomena of matter. The\\nintellect is a function of the brain and its subordinate nervous\\norgans. The laws of matter are therefore the laws of mind.\\nMental phenomena are expressible in terms of material. And\\nsince all material phenomena are expressible in terms of the\\n\\n  \\n                            \\natom and molecule (or whatever names be given to the\\nultimate forms of matter), therefore all mental are similarly\\nexpressible. The ultimate form of matter contains, then,\\nimplicitly, all phenomena of mind and society. In short, the coarsest\\nform of matter with which you can begin, as well as the\\nhighest organism with which you end, must contain all\\nemotion, volition, and knowledge, the knowing subject and\\nits relations. Beginning, then, with a strictly monistic\\ntheory, and keeping directly in the line of materialistic\\nreasoning, we have ended with the conclusion that the ultimate\\nform of matter has dualistic \"mind\" and \"matter\"\\nproperties. Nor is there any escape from this conclusion on a\\nmaterialistic basis. Therefore on its physical or constructive\\nside we find such a theory suicidal.\\nTo be sure, a materialist might reply that ultimately\\nthe \"matter\"-molecular-property accounted for and caused\\nthe \"mind\"-molecular-property, but proof, or suggestion of\\nproof, or suggestion as to method of finding proof, all are\\nequally absent. If a materialist were to say that this double-\\nsided substance is what he means by matter, we could only\\nreply that he is playing with words—that it is just as much\\nmind as it is matter.\\nWe have now to consider the strictly metaphysical\\nassumptions of materialism.\\nFirst, it assumes the possibility of ontological\\nknowledge, by which we mean knowledge of being or substance\\napart from a mere succession of phenomena. The substance\\nwhich is so known is matter. Now, since it is this statement\\nthat a belief in the possibility of ontological knowledge is an\\ninherent necessity in all materialistic reasoning, which is the\\nbasis of our criticism, the statement must be examined more\\nfully. Suppose for the moment that it is not such an inherent\\nnecessity—that it is possible to found materialism on\\nsomething besides an ontological basis. If there be no knowledge\\nof substance as such, there is either only knowledge of\\nphenomena produced by the activity of the Ego (pure\\nsubjective idealism), or of phenomena entirely unrelated to\\nany substance whatever (Humian scepticism), or of those\\nrelated only to objective spirit (Berkeleian idealism), or of\\nthose related to an unknown and unknowable substance (H.\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nSpencer), or of those brought into unity by the forms of\\nknowledge which the mind necessarily imposes on all\\nphenomena given in consciousness (as Kant). Now, since none\\nof these can afford a sufficient basis for a theory, which posits\\nmatter as the universal underlying unity, we must admit\\nthat materialism exists on the basis of a belief in the\\npossibility of ontological knowledge of such objective reality. If a\\nmaterialist, who still believes that we have no knowledge of\\nsubstance as such, replies that while we have knowledge of\\nphenomena only, yet we know them as the effects of matter,\\nthe answer is obvious. Either we know this substance,\\nmatter, which is the cause of them, or we do not. If we do, it is\\nontological knowledge. If we do not, then it is as much\\nassumption to claim that it is matter as it would be to name\\nit mind. We must conclude, therefore, that a knowledge\\ntranscending phenomena is the sole thinkable basis for\\nmaterialism.\\nStarting from this, we have to consider the relation of\\nsuch knowledge to materialism. What is involved in\\nknowledge of matter as substance?\\nTo know, requires something which knows. To know\\nmaterial phenomena, are required mental phenomena. A\\nthing is for the mind non-existent until it is an idea or\\nphenomenon of the mind. To know substance, matter, is\\nrequired substance, mind. If materialism merely posited\\nknowledge of material phenomena, there would be required\\nto give it validity only mental phenomena, which do, on\\nevery theory, exist. A theory, however, which posits\\nknowledge of a substance besides, must also posit something more\\nthan phenomena in order to know this substance. If there be\\nno substance, mind, then there are only series of mental\\nstates or successions of mental phenomena. But it is a mere\\ntruism to say that phenomena cannot go beyond phenomena.\\nSuccessions of consciousnesses irrelated, or related only in\\ntime, can but give knowledge of phenomena similarly\\nrelated. Undoubtedly the former may be but subjective, while\\nthe latter are objective, but that does not constitute\\nknowledge of substance. To have real knowledge of real being,\\nthere must be something which abides through the\\nsuccessive states, and which perceives their relations to that being\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nand to itself. To say that the mind, if itself a mere\\nphenomenon or group of phenomena, can transcend phenomena and\\nobtain a knowledge of that reality which accounts both for\\nother phenomena and for itself, is absurd. But there is no\\nneed to multiply words to show what is, after all,\\nself-evident—that phenomenal knowledge is phenomenal, and that\\nto transcend phenomena there must be something besides a\\nphenomenon. We find materialism, then, in this position. To\\nprove that mind is a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to\\nassume the possibility of ontological knowledge—i.e., real\\nknowledge of real being; but in that real knowledge is\\nnecessarily involved a subject which knows. To prove that\\nmind is a phenomenon, it is obliged to implicitly assume that\\nit is a substance. Could there be anything more\\nself-destructive?\\nSecondly, it assumes the reality of the causal nexus,\\nand the possibility of knowledge of real causation. In\\ndeclaring that matter causes mind, it declares that the relation is\\none of efficiency and dependency, and not one of succession\\n—antecedent and consequent. For, if it be the latter, then\\nthere are only succession and conjunction of material and\\nmental phenomena, irrelated or related only in time, in\\nwhich case it would be absurd to say that matter caused\\nmind.\\nWe have therefore to consider what is involved in real\\ncausation, and the knowledge of it as such, and what\\nrelation the involved facts bear to the theory of materialism.\\nHow, on a materialistic hypothesis, can the knowledge\\nof a real causal nexus be obtained? It cannot be a primary,\\nnecessary intuition of the human mind, nor yet a universal\\nmode of viewing things, for both of these imply the reality of\\nsubstantial mind. Nor can it be a concept obtained from\\nexperience, and generalized by unconscious habit. For, in\\nthe first place, such a concept is necessarily subjective, and\\nbelongs only to the mind which framed it. It may or may not\\nobtain as an objective relation among objective things.\\nThere is no ground for positing objective validity of any\\nmental conception, except by a priori mind necessity, which\\na materialistic theory must reject. But, secondly, and\\nchiefly, such a theory as to the origin of a knowledge of the\\n\\n  \\n                            \\ncausal nexus contains a petitio principii—i.e., it presupposes\\nreal causation to account for our knowledge of real\\ncausation. For this generalized belief, being a result of experience,\\nis itself an effect of the phenomena given in experience. To\\nensure, therefore, that it is a true concept—i.e., one holding\\ngood objectively—we must assume that it was produced by a\\ntrue causal nexus, which in turn is the thing to be accounted\\nfor. It certainly is begging the question to say that our\\nknowledge that causation is real is a result of experience,\\nwhen to prove that experience can produce a correct result\\nwe have to assume that very reality of causation which is to\\nbe proved. Nothing can be more illogical than to deduce\\nknowledge of real causation from that which has for its own\\nbasis that same reality. After accounting for the one, the\\nother still remains to be accounted for, which can be done\\nonly by reasoning in a circle. There is yet available one\\nresource to materialism—to claim that, although our\\nknowledge of true causation is not generalized from a series of\\nexperiences, it is obtained directly from the knowledge of\\nphenomena—that in any two or more phenomena there is\\nalso given the causal nexus and the knowledge of it. Now,\\nwe might object to this, that it approached the position of\\nthe strictest intuitionalist, and that, as mere phenomena,\\nthere is in them nothing but the relation of co-existence and\\nsuccession. Objective phenomena are not labelled \"this is\\nthe cause of that\"; and, therefore, if the mind thinks it finds\\nin them such a relation, that relation must be brought to the\\nphenomena by the mind itself. Or we might also say that, if\\na series of experiences is incompetent (as we have seen it is)\\nto give a knowledge of causation, on a materialistic\\nhypothesis, a fortiori, a single experience is. But waiving these, we\\nhave to see what is contained in this theory, granting the\\ntruth of materialism. According to it, the knowledge of these\\nobjects, and that of the causal nexus between them, is the\\nresult of matter, and therefore is a dependent \"effect\"—the\\nfirst effect in the perfect blank, which is to change that\\nblank into what we call mind and its content. (The first,\\nbecause by the theory the knowledge of causation, not being\\nderived from experiences, must be contained in the first two\\nphenomena given in consciousness.) But as an effect it is, of\\n\\n  \\n                            \\ncourse, a phenomenon, and for a phenomenon to transcend\\nphenomena, and attain the reality behind them, is, as before\\nshown, impossible. Ontological knowledge is not possible to\\nthe mind when the mind is considered as a phenomenal\\neffect. Knowledge of causation cannot be reached, then, on a\\nmaterialistic theory, either through experiences or a single\\nexperience without intuitional or ontological knowledge.\\nOnly one way remains—that it should be reached through\\nthe activity of the Ego itself. The mind is a true cause, and\\ngives knowledge of true causation. So, to prove mind and\\neffect, materialism would have to postulate it as a cause. It is\\nagain suicidal.\\nTo sum up: To prove a strict monism, materialism has\\nto assume an original irresolvable dualism. To prove the\\nmind a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to assume a\\nsubstance to give knowledge of that matter. To prove that it\\nis an effect of matter, it is obliged to assume either an\\nintuitional power of mind, or that mind is itself a cause, both\\nequally destructive of materialism.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that as a philosophical theory\\nmaterialism has proved itself a complete felo-de-se. To\\nafford itself a thinkable basis, it assumes things which\\nthoroughly destroy the theory.\\n\\n  \\n                            \\n'},\n",

       "  'text: ': '\\n\\nThe problem of philosophy is to determine the meaning of\\nthings as we find them, or of the actual. Since these things\\nmay be gathered under three heads, the problem becomes:\\nto determine the meaning of Thought, Nature, and God,\\nand the relations of one to another. The first stage of\\nthought being Dogmatism, the first philosophy will be that\\nof the common uneducated mind-Natural Realism. God,\\nself, and the world are three independent realities, and the\\nmeaning of each is just what it seems to be. If, however,\\nthey are independent realities, how can they relate to each\\nother? This question gives rise to the second stage of\\nDogmatic Philosophy, which, according to the mind of the\\nholder, takes either the direction of Dogmatic Idealism or a\\nDualism with God as the Deus ex Machina, like that of\\nDescartes. The reconciliation of the elements here involved\\nleads to the third stage, where God becomes the Absolute,\\nand Nature and Self are but his manifestations. This is\\nPantheism, and the view-point of Spinoza. Thought and\\nbeing become one; the order of thought is the order of\\nexistence. Now a final unity seems obtained, and real\\nknowledge possible.\\nThe problem of philosophy being to determine the\\nmeaning of the Actual, its final test must be the\\ncompleteness with which its answer agrees with and accounts for the\\nActual. By this we do not mean, of course, that its\\ninterpretation must agree with the common interpretation. There is\\ncertainly no shadow of reason for supposing that the\\nmetaphysic of the uneducated mind is the final one to which all\\nmetaphysic must conform. But every philosophy must\\n  \\n                            \\nanswer this question: Does it provide the factors which in their\\ndevelopment account for the Actual as it is interpreted by\\nthat theory, and for other interpretations also? In short, it\\nmust account not only for things as they are, but also as they\\nseem to be. To stop at the first point is simply to beg the\\nquestion. The best answer to any question is the one which\\nenables you to understand and to account for all other\\npossible answers.\\nHas Spinoza done this? It must be confessed that to\\nmany minds he seems to have done so. That we may attempt\\nto see whether he has or not, let us state the problem again.\\nIt is to reconcile the Infinite, and the apparent finite, by the\\nhypothesis of the Infinite alone; to show the unity between\\nthe Absolute and the seeming relative by the hypothesis of\\nthe Absolute alone. A hard task; but in reading the Ethics of\\nSpinoza, we seem to find it accomplished, and the two\\nelements, side by side, deduced from a common principle. To\\naid the mind to determine whether this accomplishment is\\nonly seeming, or is real, is our object now.\\nWe shall endeavor to show that the solution of the\\nproblem by Spinoza, the reconciliation of the two elements,\\nis brought about only by the assumption of contradictory\\nelements in his premises, and the surreptitious bringing in\\nof new ones as he proceeds. As we begin, we can do so with\\nno better thought than that of Kant. A system which\\nproceeds geometrically, like Spinoza\\'s, must either draw\\nsynthetic or analytic conclusions, the analytic being conclusions\\nwhich simply unfold what was already contained in the\\ngiven conceptions, the synthetic being those which go\\nbeyond the given ones and add something to them. If the\\nformer, then, unless you would beg the whole question, you\\nmust show the validity and reality of your definitions; if the\\nlatter, you must show whence you obtain your material for\\ngoing outside of the given conceptions. We shall endeavor to\\nshow the existence of contradictory elements in Spinoza\\'s\\npremises, not by a direct examination of them, but indirectly\\nby drawing from them conclusions in plainest contradiction\\nto those which he draws.\\nThe object of the First Part of Spinoza\\'s Ethics, \"De\\nDeo,\" is to demonstrate the existence of one substance\\n  \\n                            \\ninfinite in infinite attributes, and to show the relation of this\\nsubstance to finite things-viz., that they are but its\\naccidents. That our exposition may be as clear as possible, we\\nshall for the occasion adopt Spinoza\\'s method, and, taking\\nhis axioms and definitions as our premises, draw conclusions\\nfrom them in geometrical form. To distinguish, our\\npropositions will be designated by Arabic, and Spinoza\\'s by Roman\\nnumerals.\\nDefinit. I. By that which is the cause of itself I\\nunderstand that whose essence involves existence, or that whose\\nnature can only be conceived as existent.\\nII. That thing is said to be finite in its kind which can\\nbe limited by another of the same nature.\\nIII. By substance I understand that which is in itself,\\nand is conceived through itself—i.e., whose conception does\\nnot need any other conception by which it must be formed.\\nIV. By attribute I understand that which the mind\\nperceives, in substance, as constituting its essence.\\nV. By mode I understand the accidents of substance,\\nor that which is in something else, by means of which also it\\nis conceived.\\nVI. By God I understand the being absolutely infinite\\n—i.e., the substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of\\nwhich expresses an eternal and infinite essence.\\nVII. That is called free which exists by the sole\\nnecessity of its own nature, and is determined to action by itself\\nalone.\\nVIII. By eternity I understand existence itself, in so far\\nas it is conceived to follow necessarily from the definition\\nalone of the eternal thing.\\nAxiom I. All things which are, are in themselves, or in\\nsomething else.\\nII. That which cannot be conceived by means of\\nanother must be conceived through itself.\\nIII. From a given determined cause an effect follows\\nnecessarily, and, on the other hand, if there be no\\ndetermined cause, an effect cannot follow.\\nIV. The knowledge of an effect depends upon and\\ninvolves the knowledge of the cause.\\nV. Whatever things have nothing in common with\\n\\n  \\n                            \\neach other cannot be understood by means of each other, or\\nthe conception of one does not involve that of the other.\\nVI. A true idea must agree with the object\\nrepresented.\\nVII. The essence of whatever can be conceived as non-\\nexistent does not involve existence.\\nProp. 1. An attribute must be conceived through\\nitself, and through itself alone.\\nDem. An attribute is that which the intellect perceives\\nto constitute the essence of substance (Def. 4), and hence\\nmust be conceived through itself (Def. 3), which was the\\nfirst point; and through itself alone; for if an attribute could\\nbe conceived through something else, since it constitutes the\\nessence of substance, a substance could be also thus\\nconceived, which is absurd (Def. 3). Therefore, etc.\\nProp. 2. No attribute can possess a mode.\\nDem. A mode, if it exist, is an accident of substance or\\n(since attribute constitutes the essence of substance) of\\nattribute, or that which is in something else, by whose\\nmeans it must be conceived (Def. 5). But an attribute must\\nbe conceived through itself alone (Prop. 1), and hence\\ncannot possess a mode. Q.E.D.\\nProp. 3. Nothing exists but attributes and modes.\\nDem. For all things can be conceived only through\\nthemselves or through something else. But that which is\\nconceived through itself is an attribute (Defs. 4 and 3, or\\nProp. 1), and that which is conceived through something\\nelse is a mode. Therefore, etc.\\nCor. 1. Nothing exists but attributes. If not, suppose\\nsomething else exists, which (by preceding Prop.) must be\\na mode. But since a mode (Def. 5) cannot be in itself alone,\\nit must be in something else (Ax. 1), which can only be an\\nattribute, since nothing else exists. But this is absurd, since\\n(Prop. 2) no attribute can possess a mode. Therefore, etc.\\nCor. 2. Things can be distinguished only by their\\nattributes. For nothing else exists.\\nCor. 3. Two or more attributes of the same nature\\ncannot be given. For since things (preceding Cor.) can be\\ndistinguished only by their attributes, if there were two of\\nthe same nature they could not be distinguished—i.e., would\\nbe one and the same (Ax. 4). Therefore, etc.\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nProp. 4. Every attribute is infinite.\\nDem. For if finite it must be limited by an attribute\\n(Cor. 1, Prop. 3) of the same nature (Def. 2), which is\\nimpossible (Cor. 3, Prop. 3). Therefore, etc.\\nCor. There are no finite things. For nothing exists but\\nattributes (Cor. 1, Prop. 3), and they are all infinite.\\nScholium. It will now be immediately seen that we\\nhave arrived at a denial of one of Spinoza\\'s fundamental\\nconclusions-viz., the existence of finite things as modes or\\naccidents of God. It has not been sufficiently pointed out, I\\nthink, how surreptitiously Spinoza introduces this\\nconception. It will be found in Prop. XXVIII, where he states that\\nany particular thing which is finite, and has a determined\\nexistence, cannot exist or be determined to action except it\\nbe so determined by another finite object similarly\\ndetermined, and so on infinitely. But it will be noticed that this is\\na conditional judgment, stating only that if there are finite\\nthings, they are so determined. But the very question is: are\\nthere such finite objects? and Spinoza only assumes that. He\\nhas made his synthetic judgment only by smuggling in one\\nof the very things to be accounted for. The question as to\\nhow finite objects are determined possesses no relevancy or\\nvalidity until it is shown that finite objects can exist at all.\\nBut Spinoza proceeds as if his conditional judgment\\npossessed validity not only in its conclusion, but also with\\nregard to its predicate—the existence of finite things. In\\nshort, he begs the whole question, and the greater part of his\\nsecond book rests ultimately on this petitio. An examination\\nof the demonstration of this 28th Prop. will show what\\nconclusion Spinoza ought to have arrived at regarding the\\nexistence of the predicate of his major premise. He first\\nshows, by reference to previous propositions, that whatever\\nhas been determined has been so determined by God, and\\nthat a finite thing cannot be produced from the absolute\\nnature of any attribute of God, nor from any attribute\\nmodified with a modification which is eternal and infinite. Hence,\\nhe concludes, it must be produced by some modification\\nwhich is finite. In other words, the condition of a finite thing\\nis a finite thing, and so regressively in an infinite series. In\\nother words, again, the existence of finite things is not\\naccounted for at all; it is only assumed. The conclusion he\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nshould have drawn is the following: A finite thing, if it\\nexist, must depend upon another finite, and so on forever.\\nHence God, since he is infinite, could never cause a finite\\nthing; but since he is the cause of everything, no finite thing\\ncould be caused at all, or have existence. Hence the\\nhypothesis is false. That Spinoza did not see that this was the only\\nconclusion to be logically drawn from his arguments, shows\\nhow completely his mind was preoccupied with the realistic\\nassumptions which he had unconsciously derived from\\nprevious systems. In a similar way we may demonstrate that the\\nhypothesis regarding determination to action or change\\nmust be false if we admit the previous conclusions. For they\\nshow that no attribute can change, or produce change, since\\nit is eternal and immutable (Cor. 2, Prop. xx). And if a\\nmode can change, the change must depend upon a change in\\nsome other mode, and so on in an infinite regression. That\\nis, God could not produce the first change, which is absurd.\\nTherefore, the hypothesis of change is absurd.\\nProp. 5. One attribute cannot be produced by another.\\nDem. For since they have nothing in common (Cor. 3,\\nProp. 3) they cannot be conceived through each other (Ax.\\n5), and, accordingly, one cannot be the cause of another\\n(Ax. 4). Q.E.D.\\nProp. 6. It belongs to the nature of attributes to exist.\\nFor since one cannot be the cause of another\\n(preceding Prop.), it must be its own cause—i.e. (Def. 1), it\\nbelongs to its nature to exist.\\nCor. Attributes are eternal (preceding Prop. and Def.\\n8).\\nProp. 7. An infinite number of attributes exist.\\nDem. If you deny it, imagine, if you can, that there is\\nnot an infinite number. Then the essence of each will not\\ninclude existence, which is absurd (Prop. 6). Therefore, the\\nhypothesis is absurd, and an infinite number, etc.\\nScholium. The reader will observe that this is precisely\\nthe argument of Spinoza in Prop. XXI regarding the\\nexistence of God.\\nProp. 8. An infinite number of substances exist.\\nDem. Proved like the previous proposition, or\\nAliter. Since an infinite number of attributes exist,\\n\\n  \\n                            \\neach of which constitutes the essence of substance (Def. 4),\\nan infinite number of substances must exist.\\nCor. God, or one substance with an infinite number of\\nattributes, does not exist.\\nScholium. The reader who may have been prepared for\\nthe demonstration that the existence of finite things was\\ncontradictory to the remainder of Spinoza\\'s philosophy, will\\nperhaps be surprised to see this denial of God\\'s existence,\\nand think that it may depend upon some trickery of words,\\nand not be logically involved in Spinoza\\'s premises. But that\\nit is, may be shown, I think. In Prop. XI, where he attempts\\nto prove the existence of only one substance of infinite\\nattributes, he really proves only the existence of an infinite\\nnumber of substances, or of an infinite number of attributes. The\\nsubsumption of these latter under unity is entirely\\nunjustified by anything in the proposition. In scholium of Prop. X\\nhe seems to realize the difficulty of having an infinity of\\nattributes belonging to one and the same substance, but\\nattempts to escape from it by saying that nothing could be\\nclearer than that the more reality or being anything has, the\\nmore attributes it must have, and hence a being absolutely\\ninfinite must have an infinity of attributes. This would be\\ntrue if he had before proved that for substance, as he defines\\nit, to have such a number was possible, or implied no\\ncontradiction. But he has not done this, and it may be shown in the\\nfollowing that he cannot. An attribute is that which\\nconstitutes the essence of substance. Hence, if there are two or\\nmore attributes (a fortiori, if an infinity) in the same\\nsubstance, they must either constitute different essences, which\\nis absurd, or the same essence, in which case they will be one\\nand the same attribute. Two things only are possible to\\nSpinoza. He may have either an infinite number of attributes\\nexisting in entire independence of each other, hence\\nconstituting an infinite number of substances; or one infinite\\nsubstance, with one infinite attribute. But to unite the two\\nconceptions involves contradiction, as before shown. Yet this is\\nwhat he does practically, using either, as the exigencies of\\nthe case require.\\nWe now see Spinoza as a magician, supplied with his\\nconjuring material. With two infinites—one the very\\n  \\n                            \\nnegation of the finite, the other existing only in relation to the\\nfinite; with two substances—one with a number of attributes,\\nthe other with but one—he can proceed by dexterous\\nsubstitutions to produce any required results before our astonished\\neyes.\\nThis concludes our examination of Part First. We hope\\nthat our original statement regarding the existence of\\ncontradictions in the premises, and the introduction of new\\nconceptions from without, will be seen to be justified. The\\ncontradiction is now seen to be this: In definitions three and\\nfour a substance is posited which can be conceived only,\\nand, consequently, can exist only in itself, constituted by\\nattributes necessarily existing in the same manner. But in\\nthe fifth we have the idea of something which can exist in\\nsomething else. If the third and fourth are accepted, this\\nlatter must be necessarily denied, unless we hold that there\\nexists something besides substance and mode, which is\\ncontradictory to the first and second axioms. The similar\\ncontradiction between the two former and the sixth has been\\nsufficiently brought out in the scholium to our last\\nproposition.\\nIt would not be much better than a waste of time to\\nfollow Spinoza through his other Parts and show that in\\nevery case his apparent reconciliation of the finite and the\\ninfinite is brought about either by the introduction of the\\nthing to be accounted for, or that it is contradictory to some\\nother part of his system, or both. The clew is now in the\\npossession of the reader, and any one who wishes to, may\\ndevelop it at length.\\nWe wish, however, to simply direct attention to a few\\npoints in Part Second, \"De Mente.\" Axiom fifth of this\\nbook, upon which he relies for his proof that the object of\\nthe idea which constitutes the real existence of the human\\nmind is the body (see Prop. XIII, Pt. 2), declares that we\\nneither feel, nor perceive, any particular objects except\\nbodies and modes of thought. But Prop. XVI, Pt. 1, declares that\\ninfinite things in infinite modes must exist, from each of\\nwhich (Prop. XXXVI, Pt. 1) some effect must necessarily\\nfollow, which effect must involve the knowledge of its cause\\n(Ax. 4, Pt. 1). Again, as the first book attempted to explain\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nfinite things as accidents of substance, so the second\\nattempts to explain error as nothing positive, but simply\\ninadequacy or privation. To do this he is obliged to assume three\\nkinds of Gods. First, God in so far as he is infinite (Prop. XI,\\nCor.: quatenus infinitus est), in so far as he constitutes the\\nessence of the human mind (ibid.: quatenus humanae Mentis\\nessentiam constituit), and in so far as he is considered as\\naffected with the idea of a particular object actually existing\\n(Prop. IX, quatenus rei singularis actu existentis idea\\naffectus consideratur). It is needless to say that these different\\nnotions are either meaningless or else contradictory to each\\nother, and brought in as the exigencies of the case happen to\\nrequire one rather than the other. But the reader can easily\\ndemonstrate for himself, that error, even in the sense of\\nprivation or inadequate knowledge, is impossible by using\\nthe propositions of the first book. Another contradiction may\\nbe shown as follows: In the scholium to Prop. XV he shows\\nthat matter can be regarded as divisible, or composed of\\nparts, only in so far as it relates to the imagination; but in\\nthe second book, when he comes to account for the\\nimagination, he is obliged to assume these same parts for an\\nadequate explanation (see the Postulates, and Props. XV, XVI,\\nXVII, with Cor. and scholium, of Pt. 2).\\nIn truth, Spinoza is a juggler who keeps in stock two\\nGods—one the perfect infinite and absolute being, the other\\nthe mere sum of the universe with all its defects as they\\nappear to us. When he wishes to show God as the adequate\\ncause of all, to explain truth, inculcate morality, his\\nlegerdemain brings the First before us; when finite things, change,\\nerror, etc., are to be accounted for, his Second appears—the\\nGod who does things not in so far as he is Infinite, and who\\nis affected with the idea of finite things.\\nWe might have known, a priori, that such\\ncontradictions must occur in a pantheistic system like Spinoza\\'s. It\\nrests upon the basis that the only real knowledge is\\nimmediate knowledge. In this case the Absolute becomes mere\\nBeing, an Abstract Universal, possessed with no\\ndeterminations whatever, for determinations are negations. Such,\\nwhen Spinoza is truly logical, is his God. But, in this case,\\nhe cannot account for particular concrete objects. The two\\n\\n  \\n                            \\nelements are necessarily irreconcilable from such a stand-\\npoint as Spinoza\\'s regarding knowledge.\\nTwo logical pantheistic systems are possible. One must\\nstart with the conception of an Absolute Perfect Being in\\nwhom are all things, but this theory cannot account for\\nthings as we find them. It must deny that they are what they\\nseem to be, and elevate them into the Divine. But the rock on\\nwhich every such theory must split is the problem: If, then,\\nall things are divine, how, then, do they appear to us\\notherwise? Here is where Spinoza failed. The other theory must\\nstart from the conception of things as they seem to be, and\\nproduce its Pantheism, not by elevating them into God, but\\nby bringing God down to them. Such a theory, of course,\\ncan never arrive at the conception of the Absolute, the\\nPerfect, and the Infinite. Strictly speaking, it is not\\nPantheism at all; it is Pancosmism. But this is not a solution; it is\\nmerely an assumption of all that is to be explained.\\n\\n  \\n                            \\n'}]"

      "some typical social and economic problems which characterize\n",
      "the present.\n",
      "Experience shows that the student of morals has difficulty in\n",
      "getting the field objectively and definitely before him so that its\n",
      "problems strike him as real problems. Conduct is so intimate\n",
      "that it is not easy to analyze. It is so important that to a large\n",

      "importance in illuminating the obscure places of the moral life and\n",
      "in giving the student clues which will enable him to explore it for\n",

      "inculcate a ready-made system, but to show the development of\n",
      "theories out of the problems and experience of every-day\n",
      "conduct, and to suggest how these theories may be fruitfully applied\n",

      "though they have failed as self-inclosed and final systems. After\n",
      "the discussions of Kant and Mill, Sidgwick and Green,\n",
      "Martineau and Spencer, it is possible to affirm that there is a place in\n",
      "the moral life for reason and a place for happiness,—a place for\n",
      "duty and a place for valuation. Theories are treated not as\n",
      "incompatible rival systems which must be accepted or rejected en\n",
      "bloc, but as more or less adequate methods of surveying the\n",
      "problems of conduct. This mode of approach facilitates the\n",
      "scientific estimation and determination of the part played by\n",

      "§ 1. Definition and Methods\n",
      "The place for an accurate definition of a subject is at the\n",
      "end of an inquiry rather than at the beginning, but a brief\n",
      "definition will serve to mark out the field. Ethics is the science that\n",
      "deals with conduct, in so far as this is considered as right or\n",
      "wrong, good or bad. A single term for conduct so considered is\n",
      "\"moral conduct,\" or the \"moral life.\" Another way of stating the\n",
      "same thing is to say that ethics aims to give a systematic account\n",
      "of our judgments about conduct, in so far as these estimate it\n",
      "from the standpoint of right or wrong, good or bad.\n",
      "The terms \"ethics\" and \"ethical\" are derived from a Greek\n",
      "word ethos which originally meant customs, usages, especially\n",
      "those belonging to some group as distinguished from another,\n",
      "and later came to mean disposition, character. They are thus like\n",
      "the Latin word \"moral,\" from mores, or the German sittlich,\n",
      "from Sitten. As we shall see, it was in customs, \"ethos,\" \"mores,\"\n",
      "that the moral or ethical began to appear. For customs were not\n",
      "merely habitual ways of acting; they were ways approved by the\n",
      "group or society. To act contrary to the customs of the group\n",
      "brought severe disapproval. This might not be formulated in\n",
      "precisely our terms—right and wrong, good and bad,—but the\n",
      "attitude was the same in essence. The terms ethical and moral as\n",
      "applied to the conduct of today imply of course a far more\n",
      "complex and advanced type of life than the old words \"ethos\" and\n",
      "\"mores,\" just as economics deals with a more complex problem\n",
      "than \"the management of a household,\" but the terms have a\n",
      "distinct value if they suggest the way in which the moral life had its\n",
      "beginning.\n",
      "To give a scientific account of judgments about conduct, means\n",
      "to find the principles which are the basis of these judgments.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Conduct or the moral life has two obvious aspects. On the one\n",
      "hand it is a life of purpose. It implies thought and feeling, ideals\n",
      "and motives, valuation and choice. These are processes to be\n",
      "studied by psychological methods. On the other hand, conduct\n",
      "has its outward side. It has relations to nature, and especially to\n",
      "human society. Moral life is called out or stimulated by certain\n",
      "necessities of individual and social existence. As Protagoras put\n",
      "it, in mythical form, the gods gave men a sense of justice and of\n",
      "reverence, in order to enable them to unite for mutual\n",
      "preservation. Plato, Protagoras, sec. 320 ff.\n",
      "1 And in turn the moral life aims to modify or transform\n",
      "both natural and social environments, to build a \"kingdom of\n",
      "man\" which shall be also an ideal social order—a \"kingdom of\n",
      "God.\" These relations to nature and society are studied by the\n",
      "biological and social sciences. Sociology, economics, politics,\n",
      "law, and jurisprudence deal particularly with this aspect of\n",
      "conduct. Ethics must employ their methods and results for this\n",
      "aspect of its problem, as it employs psychology for the\n",
      "examination of conduct on its inner side.\n",
      "But ethics is not merely the sum of these various sciences. It\n",
      "has a problem of its own which is created by just this twofold\n",
      "aspect of life and conduct. It has to relate these two sides. It has\n",
      "to study the inner process as determined by the outer conditions\n",
      "or as changing these outer conditions, and the outward behavior\n",
      "or institution as determined by the inner purpose, or as affecting\n",
      "the inner life. To study choice and purpose is psychology; to\n",
      "study choice as affected by the rights of others and to judge it as\n",
      "right or wrong by this standard is ethics. Or again, to study a\n",
      "corporation may be economics, or sociology, or law; to study its\n",
      "activities as resulting from the purposes of persons or as\n",
      "affecting the welfare of persons, and to judge its acts as good or bad\n",
      "from such a point of view, is ethics.\n",
      "In approaching the study of ethics we shall employ the\n",
      "comparative and genetic methods. We cannot assume that our own\n",
      "morality is the only type that needs to be considered. Customs of\n",
      "primitive folk are doubtless not an adequate guide for present-\n",
      "day conduct, nor are our problems identical with those of\n",
      "ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. Yet despite civilization we\n",
      "are still fundamentally human. Like primitive folk and the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "ancients we are born with a certain bodily structure, depend on\n",
      "parental care, are divided into men and women, use language, learn\n",
      "to think. We have to get a living, and have to get on with our\n",
      "fellows. But as compared with earlier times, we find ourselves\n",
      "confronted with such complex and difficult situations that there\n",
      "is much doubt and perplexity as to our standards.\n",
      "When we deal with any process of life it is found to be a great\n",
      "aid for understanding present conditions if we trace the history\n",
      "of the process and see how present conditions have come about.\n",
      "And in the case of morality, in particular, there are four reasons\n",
      "for examining earlier stages. The first is that we may begin our\n",
      "study with a simpler material. Moral life at present is extremely\n",
      "complex. Professional, civic, domestic, philanthropic,\n",
      "ecclesiastical, and social obligations claim adjustment. Interests in wealth,\n",
      "in knowledge, in power, in friendship, in social welfare, make\n",
      "demand for recognition in fixing upon what is good. It is desirable\n",
      "to consider first a simpler problem. In the second place, this\n",
      "complex moral life is like the human body in that it contains\n",
      "\"rudiments\" and \"survivals.\" Some of our present standards and\n",
      "ideals were formed at one period in the past, and some at\n",
      "another. Some of these apply to present conditions and some do\n",
      "not. Some are at variance with others. Many apparent conflicts\n",
      "in moral judgments are explained when we discover how the\n",
      "judgments came to be formed in the first instance. We cannot\n",
      "easily understand the moral life of today except in the light of\n",
      "earlier morality. The third reason is that we may get a more\n",
      "objective material for study. Our moral life is so intimate a part of\n",
      "ourselves that it is hard to observe impartially. Its characteristics\n",
      "escape notice because they are so familiar. When we travel we\n",
      "find the customs, laws, and moral standards of other peoples\n",
      "standing out as \"peculiar.\" Until we have been led by some such\n",
      "means to compare our own conduct with that of others it\n",
      "probably does not occur to us that our own standards are also peculiar,\n",
      "and hence in need of explanation. It is as difficult scientifically as\n",
      "it is personally to see ourselves as others see us. It is doubtless\n",
      "true that to see ourselves merely as others see us would not be\n",
      "enough. Complete moral analysis requires us to take into our\n",
      "reckoning motives and purposes which may perhaps be\n",
      "undiscoverable by the \"others.\" But it is a great aid to this completer\n",
      "analysis if we can sharpen our vision and awaken our attention\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "by a comparative study. A fourth reason for a genetic study is\n",
      "that it emphasizes the dynamic, progressive character of\n",
      "morality. To examine the present merely may easily give the impression\n",
      "that the moral life is not a life, a moving process, something still\n",
      "in the making—but a changeless structure. There is moral\n",
      "progress as well as a moral order. This may be discovered by an\n",
      "analysis of the very nature of moral conduct, but it stands out\n",
      "more clearly and impressively if we trace the actual development\n",
      "in history. Before attempting our analysis of the present moral\n",
      "consciousness and its judgments, we shall therefore give an\n",
      "outline of earlier stages and simpler phases.\n",
      "§ 2. The Moral as a Growth\n",
      "At present biologists, psychologists, and sociologists are\n",
      "far from agreement as to the relative part played in the\n",
      "individual's make-up and character by heredity, environment, and the\n",
      "individual's own choices and habits. Similarly in the history of\n",
      "races and cultures, the importance of race, of economic and\n",
      "other social forces, and of great men, is variously estimated by\n",
      "anthropologists, historians, and other students of this complex\n",
      "problem. For our purpose we shall assume that all these factors\n",
      "enter into moral growth, although it may sometimes be\n",
      "convenient to distinguish what nature does, what society does, and\n",
      "what the individual does for himself, as he chooses, thinks,\n",
      "selects, and forms habits and character.\n",
      "We may also find it convenient to distinguish three levels of\n",
      "behavior and conduct: (1) behavior which is motived by various\n",
      "biological, economic, or other non-moral impulses or needs (e.g.,\n",
      "family, life, work), and which yet has important results for\n",
      "morals; (2) behavior or conduct in which the individual accepts with\n",
      "relatively little critical reflection the standards and ways of his\n",
      "group as these are embodied in customs or mores; (3) conduct in\n",
      "which the individual thinks and judges for himself, considers\n",
      "whether a purpose is good or right, decides and chooses, and\n",
      "does not accept the standards of his group without reflection.\n",
      "Although this separate consideration of these levels has\n",
      "convenience in gaining clear conceptions of stages and factors in moral\n",
      "growth, it is important to remember that no individual of\n",
      "maturity is wholly at any single level. We are all born into families; we\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "all pursue activities which develop thinking; we all are members\n",
      "of some social group and are subtly molded by its standards; we\n",
      "all on some occasions think and choose.\n",
      "If, instead of considering separately the factors and forces in\n",
      "moral growth, we look at the process of growth as it now goes\n",
      "on in a child, and as to some extent it has gone on in the history\n",
      "of those peoples which have had most to do with the present\n",
      "moral life of Europe and America, we may describe this as a\n",
      "process in which man becomes more rational, more social, and\n",
      "finally more moral. We examine briefly each of these aspects.\n",
      "The first need of the organism is to live and grow. The first\n",
      "impulses and activities are therefore for food, self-defense, and\n",
      "other immediate necessities. Primitive men eat, sleep, fight, build\n",
      "shelters, and give food and protection to their offspring. The\n",
      "rationalizing process will mean at first greater use of intelligence to\n",
      "satisfy these same wants. It will show itself in skilled\n",
      "occupations, in industry and trade, in the utilizing of all resources to\n",
      "further man's power and happiness. But to rationalize conduct is\n",
      "also to introduce new ends. It not only enables man to get what\n",
      "he wants; it changes the kind of objects that he wants. This\n",
      "shows itself externally in what man makes and in how he\n",
      "occupies himself. He must of course have food and shelter. But he\n",
      "makes temples and statues and poems. He makes myths and\n",
      "theories of the world. He carries on great enterprises in commerce or\n",
      "government, not so much to gratify desires for bodily wants as to\n",
      "experience the growth of power. He creates a family life which is\n",
      "raised to a higher level by art and religion. He does not live by\n",
      "bread only, but builds up gradually a life of reason.\n",
      "Psychologically this means that whereas at the beginning we want what our\n",
      "body calls for, we soon come to want things which the mind\n",
      "takes an interest in. As we form by memory, imagination, and\n",
      "reason a more continuous, permanent, highly-organized self, we\n",
      "require a far more permanent and ideal kind of good to satisfy\n",
      "us. This gives rise to the contrast between the material and ideal\n",
      "selves, or in another form, between the world and the spirit.\n",
      "The socializing side of the process of development stands for\n",
      "an increased capacity to enter into relations with other human\n",
      "beings. Like the growth of reason it is both a means and an end.\n",
      "It has its roots in certain biological facts—sex, parenthood,\n",
      "kinship—and in the necessities of mutual support and protection.\n",
      "But the associations thus formed imply a great variety of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "activities which call out new powers and set up new ends. Language is\n",
      "one of the first of these activities and a first step toward more\n",
      "complete socialization. Cooperation, in all kinds of enterprises,\n",
      "interchange of services and goods, participation in social arts,\n",
      "associations for various purposes, institutions of blood, family,\n",
      "government, and religion, all add enormously to the individual's\n",
      "power. On the other hand, as he enters into these relations and\n",
      "becomes a member of all these bodies, he inevitably undergoes a\n",
      "transformation in his interests. Psychologically the process is one\n",
      "of building up a social self. Imitation and suggestion, sympathy\n",
      "and affection, common purpose and common interest, are the\n",
      "aids in building such a self. As the various impulses, emotions,\n",
      "and purposes are more definitely organized into such a unit, it\n",
      "becomes possible to set off the interests of others against those\n",
      "interests that centre in my more individual good. Conscious\n",
      "egoism and altruism become possible. The interests of self and\n",
      "others can be raised to the plane of rights and justice.\n",
      "All this is not yet moral progress in the fullest sense. The\n",
      "progress to more rational and more social conduct is the\n",
      "indispensable condition of the moral, but not the whole story. What is\n",
      "needed is that the more rational and social conduct should itself\n",
      "be valued as good, and so be chosen and sought; or in terms of\n",
      "control, that the law which society or reason prescribes should\n",
      "be consciously thought of as right, used as a standard, and\n",
      "respected as binding. This gives the contrast between the higher\n",
      "and lower, as a conscious aim, not merely as a matter of taste. It\n",
      "raises the collision between self and others to the plane of\n",
      "personal rights and justice, of deliberate selfishness or benevolence.\n",
      "Finally it gives the basis for such organization of the social and\n",
      "rational choices that the progress already gained may be\n",
      "permanently secured in terms of acquired habit and character, while\n",
      "the attention, the struggle between duty and inclination, the\n",
      "conscious choice, move forward to a new issue.\n",
      "§ 3. Divisions of the Treatment\n",

      "Part II will analyze conduct or the moral life on its inner,\n",
      "personal side. After distinguishing more carefully what is meant by\n",

      "categories about which moral theory has centered:—namely, Good,\n",

      "Part III will study conduct as action in society. But instead of a\n",
      "general survey, attention will be upon three phases of conduct\n",
      "which are of especial interest and importance. Political rights and\n",
      "duties, the production, distribution, and ownership of wealth,\n",
      "and finally the relations of domestic and family life, all present\n",
      "unsettled problems. These challenge the student to make a\n",

      "the issues involved.\n",
      "If we can discover or discern ethical principles these ought to\n",

      "continually present themselves for decision. Whatever may be true\n",
      "for other sciences it would seem that ethics at least ought to have\n",
      "some practical value. \"In this theater of man's life it is reserved\n",
      "for God and the angels to be lookers on.\" Man must act; and he\n",

      "look into the life of certain more primitive societies. For these\n",
      "show clearly the great influence of groups on their members.\n",
      "It is not asserted that all peoples have had precisely the same\n",
      "type of groups, or the same degree of group solidarity. It is\n",
      "beyond question that the ancestors of modern civilized races lived\n",

      "Consider the following incident as related by Dr. Gray:\n",
      "A Chinese aided by his wife flogged his mother. The\n",
      "imperial order not only commanded that the criminals should be\n",
      "put to death; it further directed that the head of the clan\n",

      "representatives of the graduates of the first degree (or B.A.)\n",
      "among whom the male offender ranked should be flogged\n",
      "and exiled; that the granduncle, the uncle, and two elder\n",
      "brothers should be put to death; that the prefect and the\n",
      "rulers should for a time be deprived of their rank; that on the\n",
      "face of the mother of the female offender four Chinese\n",
      "characters expressive of neglect of duty towards her daughter\n",

      "As members of a Kumi we will cultivate friendly feelings\n",

      "landholding among the Germans:\n",
      "No one possesses privately a definite extent of land; no one\n",

      "Of the Greeks, our intellectual ancestors, as well as fellow\n",

      "\"All these phratric and gentile associations, the larger as\n",

      "idea of worship with that of ancestry, or of communion in\n",
      "certain special religious rites with communion of blood, real\n",
      "or supposed.\" \"The god or hero, to whom the assembled\n",
      "members offered their sacrifices, was conceived as the\n",
      "primitive ancestor to whom they owed their origin.\"\n",
      "Coulanges gives a similar statement as to the ancient family\n",
      "group: The Ancient City, p. 51.\n",
      "7\n",
      "The members of the ancient family were united by\n",
      "something more powerful than birth, affection, or physical\n",
      "strength; this was the religion of the sacred fire, and of dead\n",
      "ancestors. This caused the family to form a single body both\n",
      "in this life and in the next.\n",
      "Finally, the following passage on clanship among the Kafirs\n",
      "brings out two points: (1) That such a group life implies feelings\n",
      "and ideas of a distinctive sort; and (2) that it has a strength\n",
      "rooted in the very necessities of life.\n",
      "A Kafir feels that the \"frame that binds him in\" extends to\n",
      "the clan. The sense of solidarity of the family in Europe is\n",
      "thin and feeble compared to the full-blooded sense of\n",
      "corporate union of the Kafir clan. The claims of the clan entirely\n",
      "swamp the rights of the individual. The system of tribal\n",
      "solidarity, which has worked so well in its smoothness that it\n",
      "might satisfy the utmost dreams of the socialist, is a standing\n",
      "proof of the sense of corporate union of the clan. In olden\n",
      "days a man did not have any feeling of personal injury when\n",

      "give all, or nearly all of his wages to his chief; the money was\n",

      "kept within the clan, and what was the good of the clan was\n",
      "the good of the individual and vice versa. The striking thing\n",
      "about this unity of the clan is that it was not a thought-out\n",
      "plan imposed from without by legislation upon an unwilling\n",
      "people, but it was a felt-out plan which arose spontaneously\n",
      "along the line of least resistance. If one member of the clan\n",
      "suffered, all the members suffered, not in sentimental\n",
      "phraseology, but in real fact. Dudley Kidd, Savage Childhood, pp. 74 f.\n",
      "8\n",
      "The above passages refer to Aryan, Semitic, Mongolian, and\n",
      "Kafir peoples. They could be matched by similar statements\n",
      "concerning nearly every people. They suggest a way of living, and a\n",
      "view of life very different from that of the American or of most\n",
      "Europeans. Russian mirs, South Slavonian \"joint\" families, Corsican clans with their\n",
      "vendettas, and tribes in the Caucasus have kept the group interest strong, and\n",
      "the feuds of the mountaineers in some of the border States illustrate family\n",
      "solidarity.\n",
      "9 The American or European belongs to groups of\n",
      "various kinds, but he \"joins\" most of them. He of course is born\n",
      "into a family, but he does not stay in it all his life unless he\n",
      "pleases. And he may choose his own occupation, residence, wife,\n",
      "political party, religion, social club, or even national allegiance.\n",
      "He may own or sell his own house, give or bequeath his property,\n",
      "and is responsible generally speaking for no one's acts but his\n",
      "own. This makes him an \"individual\" in a much fuller sense than\n",
      "he would be if all these relations were settled for him. On the\n",
      "other hand, the member of such groups as are referred to in our\n",
      "examples above, has all, or nearly all, his relations fixed when he\n",
      "is born into a certain clan or family group. This settles his\n",
      "occupation, dwelling, gods, and politics. If it does not decide upon\n",
      "his wife, it at least usually fixes the group from which she must\n",
      "be taken. His conditions, in the words of Maine, are thus of\n",
      "\"status,\" not of \"contract.\" This makes a vast difference in his whole\n",
      "attitude. It will help to bring out more clearly by contrast the\n",
      "character of present morality, as well as to see moral life in the\n",
      "making, if we examine more carefully this group life. We shall\n",
      "find, as brought out in the passages already quoted, that the\n",
      "most important type of group is at once a kindred or family, an\n",
      "economic, a political, a religious, and a moral unit. First,\n",
      "however, we notice briefly the most important types of groups.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "§ 2. Kinship and Household Groups\n",
      "The kinship group is a body of persons who conceive of\n",
      "themselves as sprung from one ancestor, and hence as having in\n",
      "their veins one blood. It does not matter for our study whether\n",
      "each group has actually sprung from a single ancestor. It is highly\n",
      "probable that the contingencies of food-supply or of war may\n",
      "have been an original cause for the constitution of the group,\n",
      "wholly or in part. But this is of no consequence for our purpose.\n",
      "The important point is that the members of the group regard\n",
      "themselves as of one stock. In some cases the ancestor is believed\n",
      "to have been an animal. Then we have the so-called totem group,\n",
      "which is found among North American Indians, Africans, and\n",
      "Australians, and was perhaps the early form of Semitic groups.\n",
      "In other cases, some hero or even some god is named as the\n",
      "ancestor. In any case the essential part of the theory remains the\n",
      "same: namely, that one blood circulates in all the members, and\n",
      "hence that the life of each is a part of the common life of the\n",
      "group. Degrees of kindred are less important. This group, it\n",
      "should be noted, is not the same as the family, for in the family,\n",
      "as a rule, husband and wife are of different kinship groups, and\n",
      "continue their several kinship relations. Among some peoples\n",
      "marriage ceremonies, indeed, symbolize the admission of the\n",
      "wife into the husband's kinship, and in this case the family\n",
      "becomes a kinship group, but this is by no means universally the\n",
      "case.\n",
      "The feeling that one is first and foremost a member of a group,\n",
      "rather than an individual, is furthered among certain kin groups\n",
      "by a scheme of class relationship. According to this system,\n",
      "instead of having one definite person whom I, and I alone, regard\n",
      "and address as father or mother, grandfather, uncle, brother,\n",
      "sister, I call any one of a given group or class of persons mother,\n",
      "grandfather, brother, sister. And any one else who is in the same\n",
      "class with me calls the same persons, mother, grandfather, brother,\n",
      "or sister. \"In all the tribes with whom we are acquainted all the terms coincide without\n",
      "any exception in the recognition of relationships, all of which are dependent\n",
      "on the existence of a classificatory system, the fundamental idea of which is\n",
      "that the women of certain groups marry the men of others. Each tribe has one\n",
      "term applied indiscriminately to the man or woman whom he actually marries\n",
      "\n",
      "and to all whom he might lawfully marry, that is, who belong to the right\n",
      "group: One term to his actual mother and to all the women whom his father\n",
      "might lawfully have married.\"—Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes of Central\n",
      "Australia, p. 57.\n",
      "10 The simplest form of such a class system is that found\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "among the Hawaiians. Here there are five classes based upon the\n",
      "generations corresponding to what we call grandparents,\n",
      "parents, brothers and sisters, children, and grandchildren, but the\n",
      "words used to designate them do not imply any such specific\n",
      "parentage as do these words with us. Bearing this in mind, we may\n",
      "say that every one in the first class is equally grandparent to\n",
      "every one in the third; every one in the third is equally brother or\n",
      "sister to every other in the third, equally father or mother to every\n",
      "one in the fourth, and so on. In Australia the classes are more\n",
      "numerous and the relationships far more intricate and\n",
      "complicated, but this does not, as might be supposed, render the bond\n",
      "relatively unimportant; on the contrary, his relationship to every\n",
      "other class is \"one of the most important points with which each\n",
      "individual must be acquainted\"; it determines marital relations,\n",
      "food distribution, salutations, and general conduct to an\n",
      "extraordinary degree. A kinship group was known as \"tribe\" or\n",
      "\"family\" (English translation) among the Israelites; as genos,\n",
      "phratria, and phyle among the Greeks, gens and curia among the\n",
      "Romans; clan in Scotland; sept in Ireland; Sippe in Germany.\n",
      "Two kinds of families may be noted as significant for our\n",
      "purpose. In the maternal family the woman remains among her own\n",
      "kin, and the children are naturally reckoned as belonging to the\n",
      "mother's kin. The husband and father is more or less a guest or\n",
      "outsider. In a blood feud he would have to side with his own clan\n",
      "and against that of his wife if his clan quarreled with hers. Clan\n",
      "and family are thus seen to be distinct. In the paternal, which\n",
      "easily becomes the patriarchal family the wife leaves her relatives\n",
      "to live in her husband's house and among his kin. She might then,\n",
      "as at Rome, abjure her own kindred and be formally adopted\n",
      "into her husband's gens or clan. The Greek myth of Orestes is an\n",
      "illustration of the clashing of these two conceptions of father kin\n",
      "and mother kin, and Hamlet's sparing of his mother under\n",
      "similar circumstances, shows a more modern point of view.\n",
      "It is evident that with the prevalence of the paternal type of\n",
      "family, clan and household ties will mutually strengthen each\n",
      "other. This will make an important difference in the father's\n",
      "relation to the children, and gives a much firmer basis for ancestral\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "religion. But in many respects the environing atmosphere, the\n",
      "pressure and support, the group sympathy and group tradition,\n",
      "are essentially similar. The important thing is that every person\n",
      "is a member of a kindred, and likewise, of some family group,\n",
      "and that he thinks, feels, and acts accordingly. The fact that primitive man is at once an individual and a member of a group—\n",
      "that he has as it were two personalities or selves, an individual self and a clan-\n",
      "self, or \"tribal-self,\" as Clifford called it,—is not merely a psychologist's way\n",
      "of stating things. The Kafir people, according to their most recent student, Mr.\n",
      "Dudley Kidd, have two distinct words to express these two selves. They call\n",
      "one the idhlozi and the other the itongo. \"The idhlozi is the individual and\n",
      "personal spirit born with each child—something fresh and unique which is\n",
      "never shared with any one else—while the itongo is the ancestral andcorpo-rate\n",
      "corporate spirit which is not personal but tribal, or a thing of the clan, the possession\n",
      "of which is obtained not by birth but by certain initiatory rites. The idhlozi is\n",
      "personal and inalienable, for it is wrapped up with the man's personality, and\n",
      "at death it lives near the grave, or goes into the snake or totem of the clan; but\n",
      "the itongo is of the clan, and haunts the living-hut; at death it returns to the\n",
      "tribal amatongo (ancestral spirits). A man's share in this clan-spirit (itongo) is\n",
      "lost when he becomes a Christian, or when he is in any way unfaithful to the\n",
      "interests of the clan, but a man never loses his idhlozi any more than he ever\n",
      "loses his individuality.\"—Savage Childhood, pp. 14 f.\n",
      "11\n",
      "§ 3. The Kinship and Family Groups Are Also Economic and Industrial Units\n",
      "In land, as a rule, no individual ownership in the\n",
      "modern sense was recognized. Among hunting and pastoral peoples\n",
      "there was, of course, no \"ownership\" by any group in the strict\n",
      "sense of modern law. But none the less, the group, large or small,\n",
      "had its fairly well-defined territory within which it hunted and\n",
      "fished; in the pastoral life it had its pasture range and its wells of\n",
      "water. With agriculture a more definite sense of possession arose.\n",
      "But possession was by the tribe or gens or household, not by the\n",
      "individual:\n",

      "§ 4. The Kinship and Family Groups Were Political Bodies\n",
      "In a modern family the parents exercise a certain degree\n",
      "of control over the children, but this is limited in several respects.\n",
      "No parent is allowed to put a child to death, or to permit him to\n",
      "grow up in ignorance. On the other hand, the parent is not\n",
      "allowed to protect the child from arrest if a serious injury has been\n",
      "done by him. The State, through its laws and officers, is regarded\n",
      "by us as the highest authority in a certain great sphere of action.\n",
      "It must settle conflicting claims and protect life and property; in\n",
      "the opinion of many it must organize the life of its members\n",
      "where the cooperation of every member is necessary for some\n",
      "common good. In early group life there may or may not be some\n",
      "political body over and above the clan or family, but in any case\n",
      "the kin or family is itself a sort of political State. Not a State in\n",
      "the sense that the political powers are deliberately separated\n",
      "from personal, religious, and family ties; men gained a new\n",
      "conception of authority and rose to a higher level of possibilities\n",
      "when they consciously separated and defined government and\n",
      "laws from the undifferentiated whole of a religious and kindred\n",
      "group. But yet this primitive group was after all a State, not a\n",
      "mob, or a voluntary society, or a mere family; for (1) it was a\n",
      "more or less permanently organized body; (2) it exercised\n",
      "control over its members which they regarded as rightful authority,\n",
      "not as mere force; (3) it was not limited by any higher authority,\n",
      "and acted more or less effectively for the interest of the whole.\n",
      "The representatives of this political aspect of the group may be\n",
      "chiefs or sachems, a council of elders, or, as in Rome, the House\n",
      "Father, whose patria potestas marks the extreme development of\n",
      "the patriarchal family.\n",
      "The control exercised by the group over individual members\n",

      "assumes various forms among the different peoples. The more\n",
      "important aspects are a right over life and bodily freedom, in\n",
      "some cases extending to power of putting to death, maiming,\n",
      "chastising, deciding whether newly born children shall be\n",
      "preserved or not; the right of betrothal, which includes control over\n",
      "the marriage portion received for its women; and the right to\n",
      "administer property of the kin in behalf of the kin as a whole. It is\n",
      "probable that among all these various forms of control, the\n",
      "control over the marriage relations of women has been most\n",
      "persistent. One reason for this control may have been the fact that the\n",
      "group was bound to resent injuries of a member of the group who\n",
      "had been married to another. Hence this responsibility seemed\n",
      "naturally to involve the right of decision as to her marriage.\n",
      "Legal rights are still largely due to membership in a group. A\n",
      "State may allow a citizen of another country to own land, to sue\n",
      "in its courts, and will usually give him a certain amount of\n",
      "protection, but the first-named rights are often limited, and it is only\n",
      "a few years since Chief Justice Taney's dictum stated the existing\n",
      "legal theory of the United States to be that the Negro \"had no\n",
      "rights which the white man was bound to respect.\" Even where\n",
      "legal theory does not recognize race or other distinctions, it is\n",
      "often hard in practice for an alien, or member of a disesteemed\n",
      "social or economic group, to get justice. In primitive clan or\n",
      "family groups this principle is in full force. Justice is a privilege\n",
      "which falls to a man as belonging to some group—not\n",
      "otherwise. The member of the clan or the household or the village\n",
      "community has a claim, but the stranger has no standing. He\n",
      "may be treated kindly, as a guest, but he cannot demand\n",
      "\"justice\" at the hands of any group but his own. In this conception of\n",
      "rights within the group we have the prototype of modern civil\n",
      "law. The dealing of clan with clan is a matter of war or\n",
      "negotiation, not of law; and the clanless man is an \"outlaw\" in fact as\n",

      "Joint responsibility and mutual support, as shown in the blood\n",
      "feud, was a natural consequence of this fusion of political and\n",

      "§ 5. The Kinship or Household Group Was a Religious Unit\n",
      "The kinship or household group determined largely\n",
      "both the ideas and the cultus of primitive religion; conversely\n",
      "religion gave completeness, value, and sacredness to the group life.\n",
      "Kinship with unseen powers or persons was the fundamental\n",
      "religious idea. The kinship group as a religious body simply\n",
      "extended the kin to include invisible as well as visible members.\n",
      "The essential feature of religion is not unseen beings who are\n",
      "feared, or cajoled, or controlled by magic. It is rather kindred\n",
      "unseen beings, who may be feared, but who are also reverenced\n",
      "and loved. The kinship may be physical or spiritual, but\n",
      "however conceived it makes gods and worshippers members of one\n",
      "group. \"From the earliest times, religion, as distinct from magic or sorcery, addresses\n",
      "itself to kindred and friendly beings, who may indeed be angry with their\n",
      "people for a time, but are always placable except to the enemies of theirwor-shippers\n",
      "worshippers or to renegade members of the community. It is not with a vague fear\n",
      "of unknown powers, but with a loving reverence for known gods who are knit\n",
      "to their worshippers by strong bonds of kinship, that religion in the only true\n",
      "sense of the word begins.\"—Robertson Smith, Religion of the Semites, p. 54.\n",
      "18\n",
      "In totem groups, the prevailing conception is that one blood\n",
      "circulates in all the members of the group and that the ancestor\n",
      "of the whole group is some object of nature, such as sun or\n",
      "moon, plant or animal. Perhaps the most interesting and\n",
      "intelligible account of the relation between the animal ancestor and\n",
      "the members of the group is that which has been discovered in\n",
      "certain Australian tribes. These folks believe that every child, at\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "its birth, is the reincarnation of some previous member of the\n",
      "group, and that these ancestors were an actual transformation of\n",
      "animals and plants, or of water, fire, wind, sun, moon, or stars.\n",
      "Such totem groups cherish that animal which they believe to be\n",
      "their ancestor and ordinarily will not kill it or use it for food.\n",
      "The various ceremonies of religious initiation are intended to\n",
      "impress upon the younger members of the group the sacredness of\n",
      "this kindred bond which unites them to each other and to their\n",
      "totem. The beginnings of decorative art frequently express the\n",
      "importance of the symbol, and the totem is felt to be as distinctly\n",
      "a member of the group as is any of the human members.\n",
      "At a somewhat higher stage of civilization, and usually in\n",
      "connection with the patriarchal households or groups in which\n",
      "kinship is reckoned through the male line, the invisible members\n",
      "of the group are the departed ancestors. This ancestor worship is\n",
      "a power today in China and Japan, and in the tribes of the\n",
      "Caucasus. The ancient Semites, Romans, Teutons, Celts, Hindoos, all\n",
      "had their kindred gods of the household. The Roman genius,\n",
      "lares, penates, and manes, perhaps the Hebrew teraphim,—\n",
      "prized by Laban and Rachel, kept by David, valued in the time of\n",
      "Hosea—were loved and honored side by side with other deities.\n",
      "Sometimes the nature deities, such as Zeus or Jupiter, were\n",
      "incorporated with the kinship or family gods. The Greek Hestia\n",
      "and Roman Vesta symbolized the sacredness of the hearth. The\n",
      "kinship tie thus determined for every member of the group his\n",
      "religion.\n",
      "Conversely, this bond of union with unseen, yet ever present\n",
      "and powerful kindred spirits completed the group and gave to it\n",
      "its highest authority, its fullest value, its deepest sacredness. If\n",
      "the unseen kin are nature beings, they symbolize for man his\n",
      "dependence upon nature and his kinship in some vague fashion\n",
      "with the cosmic forces. If the gods are the departed ancestors,\n",
      "they are then conceived as still potent, like Father Anchises, to\n",
      "protect and guide the fortunes of their offspring. The wisdom,\n",
      "courage, and affection, as well as the power of the great heroes of\n",
      "the group, live on. The fact that the gods are unseen enhances\n",
      "tremendously their supposed power. The visible members of the\n",
      "group may be strong, but their strength can be measured. The\n",

      "long-departed ancestor may have inconceivable age and wisdom.\n",
      "The imagination has free scope to magnify his power and invest\n",
      "him with all the ideal values it can conceive. The religious bond\n",
      "is, therefore, fitted to be the bearer, as the religious object is the\n",
      "embodiment in concrete form, of the higher standards of the\n",
      "group, and to furnish the sanction for their enforcement or\n",
      "adoption.\n",
      "§ 6. Groups or Classes on the Basis of Age and Sex\n",
      "While the kindred and family groups are by far the most\n",
      "important for early morality, other groupings are significant. The\n",
      "division by ages is widespread. The simplest scheme gives three\n",
      "classes: (1) children, (2) young men and maidens, (3) married\n",
      "persons. Puberty forms the bound between the first and second;\n",
      "marriage that between the second and third. Distinct modes of\n",
      "dress and ornament, frequently also different residences and\n",
      "standards of conduct, belong to these several classes. Of groups\n",
      "on the basis of sex, the men's clubs are especially worthy of note.\n",
      "They flourish now chiefly in the islands of the Pacific, but there\n",
      "are indications, such as the common meals of the Spartans, of a\n",
      "wide spread among European peoples in early times. The\n",
      "fundamental idea Schurtz, Altersklassen und Männerbünde.\n",
      "19 seems to be that of a common house for the\n",
      "unmarried young men, where they eat, sleep, and pass their time,\n",
      "whereas the women, children, and married men sleep and eat in\n",
      "the family dwelling. But in most cases all the men resort to the\n",
      "clubhouse by day. Strangers may be entertained there. It thus\n",
      "forms a sort of general centre for the men's activities, and for the\n",
      "men's conversation. As such, it is an important agency for\n",
      "forming and expressing public opinion, and for impressing upon the\n",
      "young men just entering the house the standards of the older\n",
      "members. Further, in some cases these houses become the centre\n",
      "of rites to the dead, and thus add the impressiveness of religious\n",
      "significance to their other activities.\n",
      "Finally, secret societies may be mentioned as a subdivision of\n",
      "sex groups, for among primitive peoples such societies are\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "confined in almost all cases to the men. They seem in many cases to\n",
      "have grown out of the age classes already described. The\n",
      "transition from childhood to manhood, mysterious in itself, was\n",
      "invested with further mysteries by the old men who conducted the\n",
      "ceremonies of initiation. Masks were worn, or the skulls of\n",
      "deceased ancestors were employed, to give additional mystery and\n",
      "sanctity. The increased power gained by secrecy would often be\n",
      "itself sufficient to form a motive for such organization, especially\n",
      "where they had some end in view not approved by the dominant\n",
      "authorities. Sometimes they exercise strict authority over their\n",
      "members, and assume judicial and punitive functions, as in the\n",
      "Vehm of the Middle Ages. Sometimes they become merely leagues\n",
      "of enemies to society.\n",
      "§ 7. Moral Significance of the Kindred and Other Groups\n",
      "The moral in this early stage is not to be looked for as\n",
      "something distinct from the political, religious, kindred, and\n",
      "sympathetic aspects of the clan, family, and other groups. The\n",
      "question rather is, How far are these very political, religious, and\n",
      "other aspects implicitly moral? If by moral we mean a conscious\n",
      "testing of conduct by an inner and self-imposed standard, if we\n",
      "mean a freely chosen as contrasted with a habitual or customary\n",
      "standard, then evidently we have the moral only in germ. For the\n",
      "standards are group standards, rather than those of\n",
      "individual conscience; they operate largely through habit rather than\n",
      "through choice. Nevertheless they are not set for the individual\n",
      "by outsiders. They are set by a group of which he is a member.\n",
      "They are enforced by a group of which he is a member. Conduct\n",
      "is praised or blamed, punished or rewarded by the group of\n",
      "which he is a member. Property is administered, industry is\n",
      "carried on, wars and feuds prosecuted for the common good. What\n",
      "the group does, each member joins in doing. It is a reciprocal\n",
      "matter: A helps enforce a rule or impose a service on B; he\n",
      "cannot help feeling it fair when the same rule is applied to himself.\n",
      "He has to \"play the game,\" and usually he expects to play it as a\n",
      "matter of course. Each member, therefore, is practicing certain\n",
      "acts, standing in certain relations, maintaining certain attitudes,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "just because he is one of the group which does these things and\n",
      "maintains these standards. And he does not act in common with\n",
      "the group without sharing in the group emotions. It is a\n",
      "grotesque perversion to conceive the restraints of gods and chiefs as\n",
      "purely external terrors. The primitive group could enter into the\n",
      "spirit implied in the words of the Athenian chorus, which\n",
      "required of an alien upon adoption\n",
      "To loathe whate'er our state does hateful hold,\n",
      "To reverence what it loves. Oedipus at Colonus, vv. 186 f.\n",

      "Sympathies and sentiments growing out of common life,\n",
      "common work, common danger, common religion are the emotional\n",
      "bonds of a community. Morality is already implicit, it needs only\n",
      "to become conscious. The standards are embodied in the old\n",
      "men or the gods; the rational good is in the inherited wisdom;\n",
      "the respect for sex, for property rights, and for the common\n",
      "good, is embodied in the system—but it is there. Nor are the\n",

      "Compare this with the birth and early life of other species. In many of\n",

      "then leave the nest, find food, and look out for themselves. The\n",
      "more complex system of mammals involves a more intimate and\n",
      "longer continued relation of young to mother. But in the human\n",
      "infant the organism needs, not a few weeks or months, but years\n",
      "of care and protection before it can care for and protect itself.\n",
      "Even after the age when it is barely possible for a child to get\n",
      "food and shelter for himself increasing need of education to meet\n",
      "the demands of civilized life prolongs the period of dependence\n",
      "upon parents.\n",
      "During this period of infancy and childhood children learn,\n",
      "chiefly from mothers, the ways of behavior, the language, and\n",
      "much of the transmitted wisdom, of their group and people.\n",
      "They feel the mother's affection and develop their own\n",
      "emotional life in response. Before the machine age came in to take\n",
      "most of the arts and crafts away from the home to the factory,\n",
      "girls learned from mothers not only the preparation of food but\n",
      "the textile arts, the making of clothes and candles, knowledge of\n",
      "plants, care of the sick. Boys learned from fathers to hunt or fish,\n",
      "to tend and manage cattle, sheep, and horses, to plow, sow, and\n",
      "harvest, to work wood and metal, to build of wood, brick, and\n",
      "stone.\n",
      "The effect upon parents, especially upon the mother, of caring\n",
      "for children through infancy and childhood has been scarcely\n",
      "less significant. Such care enlarges affection, it compels thought\n",
      "of the future. It gives a worthwhile object for the work and often\n",

      "Some of these activities we now consider under rationalizing and\n",

      "§ 2. Rationalizing Agencies\n",
      "1. Earlier forms of occupation, hunting and fishing, call\n",
      "for active intelligence, although the activity is sustained to a\n",
      "great degree by the immediate interest or thrill of excitement,\n",
      "which makes them a recreation to the civilized man. Quickness\n",
      "of perception, alertness of mind and body, and in some cases,\n",
      "physical daring, are the qualities most needed. But in the\n",
      "pastoral life, and still more with the beginning of agriculture and\n",
      "commerce, the man who succeeds must have foresight and\n",
      "continuity of purpose. He must control impulse by reason. He must\n",
      "organize those habits which are the basis of character, instead of\n",
      "yielding to the attractions of various pleasures which might lead\n",
      "him from the main purpose.\n",
      "The differentiation of labor has been a powerful influence for\n",
      "increasing the range of mental life and stimulating its\n",
      "development. If all do the same thing, all are much alike, and inevitably\n",
      "remain on a low level. But when the needs of men induce\n",
      "different kinds of work, slumbering capacities are aroused and new\n",
      "ones are called into being. The most deeply-rooted\n",
      "differentiation of labor is that between the sexes. The woman performs the\n",
      "work within or near the dwelling, the man hunts or tends the\n",
      "flocks or ranges abroad. This probably tends to accentuate\n",
      "further certain organic differences. Among the men, group life in its\n",
      "simplest phases has little differentiation except \"for counsel\" or\n",
      "\"for war.\" But with metal working and agricultural life the field\n",
      "widens. At first the specializing is largely by families rather than\n",
      "by individual choice. Castes of workmen may take the place of\n",
      "mere kinship ties. Later on the rules of caste in turn become a\n",
      "hindrance to individuality and must be broken down if the\n",
      "individual is to emerge to full self-direction.\n",
      "2. Aside from their influence as work, arts and crafts have a\n",
      "distinctly elevating and refining effect. The textiles, pottery, and\n",
      "skilfully made tools and weapons; the huts or houses when\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "artistically constructed; the so-called free or fine arts of dance and\n",
      "music, of color and design—all have this common element: they\n",
      "give some visible or audible embodiment for order or form. The\n",
      "artist or craftsman must make definite his idea in order to work\n",
      "it out in cloth or clay, in wood or stone, in dance or song. When\n",
      "thus embodied, it is preserved, at least for a time. It is part of the\n",
      "daily environment of the society. Those who see or hear are\n",
      "having constantly suggested to them ideas and values which bring\n",
      "more meaning into life and elevate its interests. Moreover, the\n",
      "order, the rational plan or arrangement which is embodied in all\n",
      "well-wrought objects, as well as in the fine arts in the narrow\n",
      "sense, deserves emphasis. Plato and Schiller have seen in this a\n",
      "valuable preparation for morality. To govern action by law is\n",
      "moral, but it is too much to expect this of the savage and the\n",
      "child as a conscious principle where the law opposes impulse. In\n",
      "art as in play there is direct interest and pleasure in the act, but\n",
      "in art there is also order or law. In conforming to this order the\n",
      "savage, or the child, is in training for the more conscious control\n",
      "where the law, instead of favoring, may thwart or oppose\n",
      "impulse and desire.\n",
      "3. A child begins very early to explore and test the things and\n",
      "people about him. He is curious. He handles, tastes, looks,\n",
      "listens, and things get meanings. He finds obstacles and is forced to\n",
      "contrive a way to do or get what he wants. When a child in a\n",
      "hunting tribe begins to hunt he must study the ways of wild\n",
      "animals. If he is to get his living from the soil or the sea he will\n",
      "watch the sky, and try to forecast the weather. He will wonder at\n",
      "the movements of sun, moon, and stars. If he becomes a trader\n",
      "he must decide what goods to carry, and will match wits with his\n",
      "customers. All these problems call for thinking, that is, for\n",
      "making use of something which he has seen, or known, or known\n",
      "about, before in order to help in meeting this new situation. If we\n",
      "can see that the new object is like some things and different from\n",
      "others that we have known before, that helps to class it. We\n",
      "think that if it moves it is alive, or that if it is sweet it is good to\n",
      "eat, or we think that a man who speaks roughly is angry. Such\n",
      "\"general\" ideas as \"alive,\" \"sweet,\" \"angry\" enable us to connect\n",
      "our particular experiences into wholes, to guide our acts\n",
      "intelligently, instead of either blindly following habit, or being dazed\n",
      "by each new event as though we had never seen anything like it\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "before. Now to guide our lives intelligently toward what is good\n",
      "requires the same kind of thinking. It means looking ahead to\n",
      "forecast all the consequences of a decision. Training in thinking\n",
      "is then forging a tool which is indispensable for the most\n",
      "intelligent morality.\n",
      "§ 3. Socializing Agencies\n",
      "1. Language might well have been noted under\n",
      "rationalizing agencies, for if not absolutely essential to thinking it is so\n",
      "intimately a part of it by furnishing the symbols and tools with\n",
      "which most thinking does its work that it is virtually\n",
      "indispensable. Its function as a socializing agency is similarly\n",
      "fundamental. It is not the only method of \"communicating,\" i.e., of\n",
      "imparting, or sharing, or making common, some thought or\n",
      "feeling, but it is by far the most usual, and for many purposes the\n",
      "only method. When groups speak different languages it is\n",
      "notoriously difficult for them to unite under a common government.\n",
      "There was good psychology underlying the story of the Tower of\n",
      "Babel, according to which the Lord is said to have scattered the\n",
      "ambitious builders by confounding their language, \"and they left\n",
      "off to build the city.\" Written language enables each generation\n",
      "to profit more fully from the thought and work of previous\n",
      "generations. The sacred Hebrew Scriptures kept the Jews a people\n",
      "after their capital city had been destroyed, Homer unified\n",
      "generations of Greeks, Shakspere and the English Bible have given\n",
      "common imagery to millions of widely scattered dwellers in\n",
      "many lands. Increased means of communication are among the\n",
      "inventions of largest promise for mutual understanding among\n",
      "men.\n",
      "2. Aside from their effects in promoting intelligence, courage,\n",
      "and ideality of life, industry, art, and war have a common factor\n",
      "by which they all contribute powerfully to the social basis of\n",
      "morality. They all require cooperation. They are socializing as well\n",
      "as rationalizing agencies. Mutual aid P. Kropotkin, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution; Bagehot, Physics and\n",

      "community is like unto one without a hand.\" Those clans or\n",
      "groups which can work together, and fight together, are stronger\n",
      "in the struggle against nature and other men. The common\n",
      "activities of art have value in making this community of action more\n",
      "possible. Cooperation implies a common end. It means that each\n",
      "is interested in the success of all. This common end forms then a\n",
      "controlling rule of action, and the mutual interest means\n",
      "sympathy. Cooperation is therefore one of nature's most effective\n",
      "agencies for a social standard and a social feeling.\n",
      "In industry, while there was not in primitive life the extensive\n",
      "exchange of goods which express the interdependence of modern\n",
      "men, there was yet much concerted work, and there was a great\n",

      "hunting or fishing, for instance, although certain kinds of game might\n",
      "be pursued by the individual hunter, the great buffalo and deer\n",
      "hunts were organized by the tribe as a whole. \"A hunting bonfire\n",
      "was kindled every morning at daybreak at which each brave\n",

      "the chase is not for the individual but for the group. In the\n",
      "pastoral life the care of the flocks and herds necessitates at least\n",
      "some sort of cooperation to protect these flocks from the attacks\n",
      "of wild beasts and from the more dreaded forays of human\n",

      "degree than is the case with any other art. There is, in the first\n",
      "place, as in the dance, a unity of rhythm. Rhythm is based upon\n",
      "cooperation and, in turn, immensely strengthens the possibility\n",
      "of cooperation. In bas-reliefs upon the Egyptian monuments\n",
      "representing the work of a large number of men who are moving a\n",
      "stone bull, we find the sculptured figure of a man who is beating\n",
      "the time for the combined efforts. Whether all rhythm has come\n",
      "from the necessities of common action or whether it has a\n",
      "physiological basis sufficient to account for the effect which rhythmic\n",
      "action produces, in any case when a company of people begin to\n",
      "work or dance or sing in rhythmic movement, their efficiency\n",
      "and their pleasure are immensely increased. In addition to the\n",
      "effect of rhythm we have also in the case of song the effect of\n",
      "unity of pitch and of melody, and the members of the tribe or\n",
      "clan, like those who today sing the Marseillaise or chant the great\n",
      "anthems of the church, feel in the strongest degree their mutual\n",
      "sympathy and support. For this reason, the Corroborees of the\n",
      "Australian, the sacred festivals of Israel, the Mysteries and public\n",
      "festivals of the Greeks, in short, among all peoples, the common\n",
      "gatherings of the tribe for patriotic or religious purposes, have\n",
      "been attended with dance and song. In many cases these carry\n",
      "the members on to a pitch of enthusiasm where they are ready to\n",
      "die for the common cause.\n",
      "Melodic and rhythmic sound is a unifying force simply by\n",
      "reason of form, and some of the simpler songs seem to have little\n",
      "else to commend them, but at very early periods there is not\n",
      "merely the song but the recital, in more or less rhythmic or\n",
      "literary form, of the history of the tribe and the deeds of the\n",

      "§ 4. Moral Interpretation of This First Level\n",
      "On this first level we are evidently dealing with forces\n",
      "and conduct, not as moral in purpose, but as valuable in result.\n",
      "They make a more rational, ideal, and social life, and this is the\n",
      "necessary basis for more conscious control and valuation of\n",
      "conduct. The forces are biological or sociological or psychological.\n",
      "They are not that particular kind of psychological activities\n",
      "which we call moral in the proper sense, for this implies not only\n",
      "getting a good result but aiming at it. Some of the activities, such\n",
      "as those of song and dance, or the simpler acts of maternal care,\n",
      "have a large biological element. We cannot call these moral in so\n",
      "far as they are purely biological. Others imply a large amount of\n",
      "intelligence, as, for example, the operations of agriculture and\n",
      "the various crafts. These have purpose, such as to satisfy hunger,\n",
      "or to forge a weapon against an enemy. But the end is one set up\n",
      "by our physical or impulsive nature. So long as this is merely\n",
      "accepted as an end, and not compared with others, valued, and\n",
      "chosen, it is not properly moral.\n",
      "The same is true of emotions. There are certain emotions on\n",
      "the impulsive level. Such are parental love in its most elemental\n",
      "form, sympathy as mere contagious feeling, anger, or\n",
      "resentment. So far as these are at this lowest level, so far as they signify\n",
      "simply a bodily thrill, they have no claim to proper moral value.\n",
      "They are tremendously important as the source from which\n",
      "strong motive forces of benevolence, intelligent parental care,\n",
      "and an ardent energy against evil may draw warmth and fire.\n",
      "Finally, even the cooperation, the mutual aid, which men give,\n",
      "so far as it is called out purely by common danger, or common\n",
      "advantage, is not in the moral sphere in so far as it is instinctive,\n",
      "or merely give and take. To be genuinely moral there must be\n",
      "some thought of the danger as touching others and therefore\n",
      "requiring our aid; of the advantage as being common and\n",
      "therefore enlisting our help.\n",

      "But even although these processes are not consciously moral\n",
      "they are nevertheless fundamental. The activities necessary for\n",
      "existence, and the emotions so intimately bound up with them,\n",
      "are the cosmic roots of the moral life. And often in the higher\n",
      "stages of culture, when the codes and instruction of morality and\n",
      "society fail to secure right conduct, these elementary agencies of\n",
      "work, cooperation, and family life assert their power. Society\n",

      "stock, just as all ducks swim. But a large part of human conduct,\n",
      "in savage as truly as in civilized life, is not merely instinctive.\n",
      "There are approved ways of acting, common to a group, and\n",
      "handed down from generation to generation. Such approved\n",
      "ways of doing and acting are customs, or to use the Latin term,\n",
      "which Professor Sumner thinks brings out more clearly this\n",
      "factor of approval, they are mores. W. G. Sumner, Folkways, p. 30.\n",
      "1 They are habits—but they are\n",

      "feel the group's disapproval. The young are carefully trained to\n",
      "observe them. At times of special importance, they are rehearsed\n",
      "with special solemnity. For an act so sanctioned there is a\n",
      "cumulative pressure: the group all do it and approve it; they always\n",
      "have done it and approved it; it will be well to do it and\n",
      "dangerous not to do it.\n",
      "The old men, or the priests, or medicine men, or chiefs, or old\n",
      "women, may be the especial guardians of these customs. They\n",
      "may modify details, or add new customs, or invent explanations\n",
      "for old ones. But the authority back of them is the group in the\n",
      "full sense. Not the group composed merely of visible and living\n",
      "members, but the larger group which includes the dead, and the\n",
      "kindred totemic or ancestral gods. Nor is it the group considered\n",
      "as a collection of individual persons. It is rather in a vague way\n",
      "the whole mental and social world. Regard for such a group\n",
      "becomes akin to religious reverence. The fact that most of the\n",
      "customs have no known date or origin makes them seem a part of\n",
      "the nature of things. Indeed there is more than a mere analogy\n",
      "between the primitive regard for custom and that respect for\n",
      "\"nature\" which from the Stoics to Spencer has sought a moral\n",
      "standard in living \"according to nature.\"\n",
      "The basis of customs is to be sought in several concurrent\n",
      "factors. In the first place every member of a group stands in certain\n",
      "relations of give and take to other members of the group, and\n",
      "usually to the group as a whole. B. Malinowski, Crime and Custom in Savage Society.\n",

      "machinery of society. Customs are the natural workings of this\n",
      "machinery. Even in modern society the law considers that certain\n",
      "obligations and rights follow from the status of the persons concerned,\n",
      "such as parent and child, husband and wife, landlord and tenant.\n",

      "for group concern—to make conduct a matter of mores and not\n",

      "§ 2. Means of Enforcing Customs\n",
      "The most general means for enforcing customs are\n",
      "public opinion, taboos, ritual or ceremony, and physical force.\n",
      "Public approval uses both language and form to express its\n",
      "judgments. Its praise is likely to be emphasized by some form of\n",
      "art. The songs that greet the returning victor, the decorations,\n",
      "costumes, and tattoos for those who are honored, serve to voice\n",
      "the general sentiment. On the other hand ridicule or contempt is\n",
      "a sufficient penalty to enforce compliance with many customs\n",
      "that may be personally irksome. It is very largely the ridicule of\n",
      "the men's house which enforces certain customs among the men\n",
      "of peoples which have that institution. It is the ridicule or scorn\n",
      "of both men and women which forbids the Indian to marry\n",
      "before he has proved his manhood by some notable deed of\n",
      "prowess in war or chase. Among the Trobriand Islanders the power of\n",
      "public disapproval is so great that an offender who incurs it may\n",
      "feel compelled to commit suicide as the only possible course;\n",
      "life becomes intolerable. B. Malinowski, op. cit.\n",
      "8 Even in civilized society no one finds\n",
      "it a light matter to be sent to Coventry or cut dead by all his\n",
      "acquaintance.\n",
      "Taboos are perhaps not so much a means for enforcing\n",
      "custom, as they are themselves customs invested with peculiar and\n",
      "awful sanction. They prohibit or ban any contact with certain\n",
      "persons or objects under penalty of danger from unseen beings.\n",
      "Any events supposed to indicate the activity of spirits, such as\n",
      "birth and death, are likely to be sanctified by taboos. The danger\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "is contagious; if a Polynesian chief is taboo, the ordinary man\n",
      "fears even to touch his footprints. But the taboos are not all\n",
      "based on mere dread of the unseen.\n",
      "They include such acts as have been found by experience\n",
      "to produce unwelcome results.—The primitive taboos\n",
      "correspond to the fact that the life of man is environed by perils:\n",
      "His food quest must be limited by shunning poisonous\n",
      "plants. His appetite must be restrained from excess. His\n",
      "physical strength and health must be guarded from dangers.\n",
      "The taboos carry on the accumulated wisdom of generations\n",
      "which has almost always been purchased by pain, loss,\n",
      "disease, and death. Other taboos contain inhibitions of what\n",
      "will be injurious to the group. The laws about the sexes,\n",
      "about property, about war, and about ghosts, have this\n",
      "character. They always include some social philosophy. Sumner, Folkways, pp. 33 f.\n",
      "9\n",
      "They may be used with conscious purpose. In order to have a\n",
      "supply of cocoanuts for a religious festival the head men may\n",
      "place a taboo upon the young cocoanuts to prevent them from\n",
      "being consumed before they are fully ripe. The conception works\n",
      "in certain respects to supply the purpose which is later subserved\n",
      "by ideas of property. But it serves also as a powerful agency to\n",
      "maintain respect for the authority of the group.\n",
      "As taboo is the great negative guardian of customs, ritual is\n",
      "the great positive agent. It works by forming habits, and operates\n",
      "through associations formed by actually doing certain acts,\n",
      "usually under conditions which appeal to the emotions. The charm\n",
      "of music and of orderly movement, the impressiveness of ordered\n",
      "masses in processions, the awe of mystery, all contribute to stamp\n",
      "in the meaning and value. Praise or blame encourages or inhibits;\n",
      "ritual secures the actual doing and at the same time gives a value\n",
      "to the doing. It is employed by civilized peoples more in the case\n",
      "of military or athletic drill, or in training children to observe\n",
      "forms of etiquette, so that these may become \"second nature.\"\n",
      "Certain religious bodies also use its agency. But in primitive life it\n",
      "is widely and effectively used to insure for educational, political,\n",
      "and domestic customs obedience to the group standards, which\n",
      "among us it secures to the codes of the army, or to those of social\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "etiquette. Examples of its elaborate and impressive use will be\n",
      "given below under educational ceremonies.\n",
      "When neither group opinion, nor taboo, nor ritual secures\n",
      "conformity, there is always in the background physical force.\n",
      "The chiefs are generally men of strength whose word may not be\n",
      "lightly disregarded. Sometimes, as among the Sioux, the older\n",
      "braves constitute a sort of police. Between different clans the\n",
      "blood feud is the accepted method of enforcing custom, unless a\n",
      "substitute, the wergeld, is provided. For homicide within a clan\n",
      "the remaining members may drive the slayer out, and whoever\n",
      "meets such a Cain may slay him. If a man murdered his chief of\n",
      "kindred among the ancient Welsh he was banished and \"it was\n",
      "required of every one of every sex and age within hearing of the\n",
      "horn to follow that exile and to keep up the barking of dogs, to\n",
      "the time of his putting to sea, until he shall have passed three\n",
      "score hours out of sight.\" Seebohm, The Tribal System in Wales, p. 59.\n",
      "10 It should be borne in mind, however,\n",
      "that physical pains, either actual or dreaded, would go but a\n",
      "little way toward maintaining authority in any such group as we\n",
      "have regarded as typical. Absolutism, with all its cruel methods\n",
      "of enforcing terror, needs a more highly-organized system. In\n",
      "primitive groups the great majority support the authority of the\n",
      "group as a matter of course, and uphold it as a sacred duty when\n",
      "it is challenged. Physical coercion is not the rule but the exception.\n",
      "§ 3. Conditions Which Bring Out the Importance of Group Standards and Render Group Control Conscious\n",
      "Although customs or mores have in them an element of\n",
      "social approval which makes them vehicles of moral judgment,\n",
      "they tend in many cases to sink to the level of mere habits. The\n",
      "reason—such as it was—for their original force—is forgotten.\n",
      "They become, like many of our forms of etiquette, mere\n",
      "conventions. There are, however, certain conditions which focus\n",
      "attention upon their importance and lift them to the level of\n",
      "conscious agencies. These conditions may be grouped under three\n",
      "heads. (1) The education of the younger, immature members of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the group and their preparation for full membership. (2) The\n",
      "constraint and restraint of refractory members and the\n",
      "adjustment of conflicting interests. (3) Occasions which involve some\n",
      "notable danger or crisis and therefore call for the especial care to\n",
      "secure the favor of the gods and avert disaster.\n",
      "1. Among the most striking educational customs are the\n",
      "initiation ceremonies which are so widely observed among primitive\n",
      "peoples. They are held with the purpose of inducting boys into\n",
      "the privileges of manhood and into the full life of the group.\n",
      "They are calculated at every step to impress upon the initiate his\n",
      "own ignorance and helplessness in contrast with the wisdom and\n",
      "power of the group; and as the mystery with which they are\n",
      "conducted imposes reverence for the elders and the authorities\n",
      "of the group, so the recital of the traditions and performances of\n",
      "the tribe, the long series of ritual acts, common participation\n",
      "in the mystic dance and song and decorations, serve to reenforce\n",
      "the ties that bind the tribe.\n",
      "Initiation into the full privileges of manhood among the tribes\n",
      "of Central Australia, for instance, includes three sets of\n",

      "These have been suggested, in the main, in the\n",

      "may, however, summarize them as a preparation for the next\n",
      "stage of morality.\n",
      "In so far as custom and mores are based on recognition of the\n",
      "actual relations of mutual or reciprocal interdependence they are\n",
      "setting standards for what is held to be \"right\" behavior,\n",
      "however much these may need criticism and reflection before they\n",
      "reach the highest levels of justice. In so far as customs and mores\n",
      "rest on rational conceptions of welfare they are pointing out\n",
      "what is to be regarded as \"good.\" In so far as they provide\n",
      "approvals and disapprovals by the group they are preparing the\n",
      "way for conceptions of excellence and \"virtue.\" Morality is thus\n",
      "guiding and controlling life even though it be defective in\n",
      "intelligence and flexibility.\n",
      "The standards and valuations of custom are, however, only\n",
      "partly rational. Many customs are irrational; some are injurious.\n",
      "But in them all the habitual is a large, if not the largest, factor.\n",
      "And this is often strong enough to resist any attempt at rational\n",
      "testing. Dr. Arthur Smith tells us of the advantage it would be in\n",
      "certain parts of China to build a door on the south side of the\n",
      "house in order to get the breeze in hot weather. The simple and\n",
      "sufficient answer to such a suggestion is, \"We don't build doors\n",

      "An additional weakness in the character of such irrational, or\n",
      "partly rational standards, is the misplaced energy they involve.\n",
      "What is merely trivial is made as important and impressive as\n",
      "what has real significance. Tithing mint, anise, and cummin is\n",
      "quite likely to involve neglect of the weightier matters of the law.\n",
      "Moral life requires men to estimate the value of acts. If the\n",
      "irrelevant or the petty is made important, it not only prevents a\n",
      "high level of value for the really important act, it loads up\n",
      "conduct with burdens which keep it back; it introduces elements\n",
      "which must be got rid of later, often with heavy loss of what is\n",
      "genuinely valuable.\n",
      "In modern law the emphasis is chiefly upon what a man does,\n",

      "blood feuds. This fear is grounded in ignorance, and resentment\n",
      "is opposed to the friendly feeling which ought to prevail between\n",
      "man and man. It of course is obvious that our war morality of\n",
      "today also violates this friendly relation, but war morality is still\n",
      "largely of a primitive type, and presupposes broken human\n",
      "relations. Yet primitive blood revenge has one element by which it\n",
      "differs from mere animal passion. It is in most cases not a\n",
      "personal but a group affair. It is undertaken for a common interest.\n",
      "It is thus a sympathetic resentment, and such resentment is\n",
      "regarded by Westermarck as one of the fundamental elements in\n",

      "the beings who embody ideals however crude, loyalty to fellow\n",

      "heartily to its fulfillment, and seeks a progressive social\n",
      "development in which every member of society shall share. Group\n",
      "morality with its agencies of custom set up a standard, but one that\n",
      "was corporate rather than personal. It approved and disapproved,\n",
      "that is, it had an idea of good, but this did not mean a good that\n",
      "was personally valued. It enlisted its members, but it was by drill,\n",
      "by pleasure and pain, and by habit, rather than by fully\n",
      "voluntary action. It secured steadiness by habit and social pressure,\n",
      "rather than by choices built into character. It maintained\n",
      "community of feeling and action, but of the unconscious rather than\n",
      "the definitely social type. Finally it was rather fitted to maintain a\n",
      "fixed order than to promote and safeguard progress. Advance\n",
      "then must (1) substitute some rational method of setting up\n",
      "standards and forming values, in place of habitual passive\n",
      "acceptance; (2) secure voluntary and personal choice and interest,\n",
      "instead of unconscious identification with the group welfare, or\n",
      "instinctive and habitual response to group needs; (3) encourage\n",
      "at the same time individual development and the demand that all\n",
      "shall share in this development—the worth and happiness of the\n",
      "person and of every person.\n",
      "Such an advance brings to consciousness two collisions. The\n",
      "oppositions were there before, but they were not felt as\n",
      "oppositions. So long as the man was fully with his group, or satisfied\n",
      "with the custom, he would make no revolt. When the movement\n",
      "begins the collisions are felt. These collisions are:\n",
      "(1) The collision between the authority and interests of the\n",
      "group, and the independence and private interests of the\n",
      "individual.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "(2) The collision between order and progress, between habit\n",
      "and reconstruction or reformation.\n",
      "It is evident that there is a close connection between these two\n",
      "collisions; in fact, the second becomes in practice a form of the\n",
      "first. For we saw in the last chapter that custom is really backed\n",
      "and enforced by the group, and its merely habitual parts are as\n",
      "strongly supported as those parts which have a more rational\n",
      "basis. It would perhaps be conceivable that a people should move\n",

      "political liberty should keep even pace with the development of\n",
      "government, in which self-interest should be accompanied by\n",
      "regard for the welfare of others, just as it may be possible for a\n",
      "child to grow into full morality without a period of \"storm and\n",
      "stress.\" But this is not usual. Progress has generally cost struggle.\n",
      "And the first phase of this struggle is opposition between the\n",
      "individual and the group. The self-assertive impulses and desires\n",
      "were present in group life, but they were in part undeveloped\n",
      "because they had not enough stimulus to call them out. A man\n",
      "could not develop his impulse for possession to its full extent if\n",
      "there was little or nothing for him to possess. In part they were\n",
      "not developed because the group held them back, and the\n",
      "conditions of living and fighting favored those groups which did keep\n",
      "them back. Nevertheless they were present in some degree,\n",
      "always contending against the more social forces. Indeed what\n",
      "makes the opposition between group and individual so strong\n",
      "and so continuous is that both the social and the individual are\n",
      "rooted in human nature. They constitute what Kant calls the\n",
      "unsocial sociableness of man. \"Man cannot get on with his fellows\n",
      "and he cannot do without them.\"\n",
      "The distinctive character and quality by which one man differs\n",
      "from his fellows or stands out from the mass or group pattern is\n",
      "known as individuality. It is that by which a man is himself and\n",
      "not another. One type of individuality is seen in the genius,\n",
      "another in the man who is able to wield power over his fellows,\n",
      "another in the prophet, another in a man or woman of broad\n",
      "human sympathy, and still another in a daring criminal.\n",

      "The term individualism, on the contrary, although sometimes\n",
      "used as a synonym of individuality, ordinarily means either\n",
      "selfishness, exclusiveness, or refers to a definite theory or policy\n",
      "having primary regard for individual rights as contrasted with\n",
      "public or community interests. In its meaning of exclusiveness or\n",
      "selfishness it supposes that the individual's private interest may\n",
      "be set over against the interest of the group or community and\n",
      "deliberately chosen. Or at least that the individual is so taken up\n",
      "with his own interests that he does not concern himself with\n",
      "those of others or of the community. It is every man for himself.\n",
      "In its reference to a definite theory of government and economics\n",
      "it does not concern us at this point, but will be considered later.\n",
      "It is evident that the growth of a child to manhood implies in\n",
      "any normal person a development of individuality. More and\n",
      "more he makes decisions and takes responsibility. He is likely to\n",
      "differ from the ways of family and school in certain respects. It is\n",
      "likewise apparent that growth of civilization favors growth of\n",
      "individuality. Whether there is or is not a similar development of\n",
      "individualism, it can readily be seen that there will often be\n",
      "favorable opportunities offered for selfish tendencies to assert\n",
      "themselves. When old restraints of custom and group control are\n",

      "development of individuality and development of individualism\n",
      "combined in such times and movements as the age of the Sophists in\n",
      "Greece, of the Renaissance in Italy, of the Enlightenment and\n",
      "Romantic movement in Western Europe, and of the industrial\n",
      "revolution. Such critical movements bring both good and evil. To\n",

      "and find expression. And even so priceless a value as liberty may\n",
      "at times tend to pass over into impatience of any social restraints\n",

      "  \n",
      "                            \n",

      "emotional basis, so it is with peoples. We note four typical\n",
      "agencies which are usually more or less active.\n",
      "1. The action of economic forces in breaking up the early\n",
      "kinship group or joint family may be noticed in the history of\n",
      "many peoples. The clan flourishes in such conditions of hunting\n",
      "life or of simple agriculture as were found among Australians\n",
      "and Indians, or among the Celts in Ireland and the Scottish\n",
      "Highlands. It cannot survive when a more advanced state of\n",
      "agriculture prevails. A certain amount of individualism will appear\n",
      "wherever the advantage for the individual lies in separate\n",
      "industry and private ownership. If buffalo was to be hunted it was\n",
      "better to pool issues, but for smaller game the skilful or persistent\n",
      "huntsman or shepherd will think he can gain more by working\n",
      "for himself. This is intensified when agriculture and commerce\n",
      "take the place of earlier modes of life. The farmer has to work so\n",
      "hard and long, his goal is so far in the future, that differences of\n",
      "character show themselves much more strongly. Hunting and\n",
      "fishing are so exciting, and the reward is so near, that even a man\n",
      "who is not very industrious will do his part. But in agriculture\n",
      "only the hard and patient worker gets a reward and he does not\n",
      "like to share it with the lazy, or even with the weaker.\n",
      "Commerce, bargaining, likewise put a great premium on individual\n",
      "shrewdness. Moreover commerce leads to the comparison of\n",
      "custom, and to interchange of ideas as well as goods. This tends\n",
      "to break down the sanctity of customs peculiar to a given group.\n",
      "The trader as well as the guest may overstep the barriers set up\n",
      "by kin. The early Greek colonists, among whom a great\n",
      "individualistic movement began, were the traders of their day. The parts\n",
      "of Europe where most survives of primitive group life are those\n",
      "little touched by modern commerce.\n",
      "But we get a broader view of economic influences if we\n",
      "consider the methods of organizing industry which have successively\n",
      "prevailed. In early society, and likewise in the earlier period of\n",
      "modern civilization, the family was a great economic unit. Many\n",
      "or most of the industries could be advantageously carried on in\n",
      "the household. As in the cases cited above (p. 57) the stronger or\n",

      "adventurous member would be constantly trying to strike out for\n",
      "himself. This process of constant readjustment is, however, far\n",
      "less thoroughgoing in its effects on mores than the three great\n",
      "methods of securing a broader organization of industry. In\n",
      "primitive society large enterprises had to be carried on by the\n",
      "cooperation of the group. Forced labor as used by the Oriental\n",
      "civilizations substituted a method by which greater works like the\n",
      "pyramids or temples could be built, but it brought with it the\n",
      "overthrow of much of the old group sympathies and mutual aid.\n",
      "In Greece and Rome slavery did the drudgery and left the\n",
      "citizens free to cultivate art, letters, and government. It gave\n",
      "opportunity and scope for the few. Men of power and genius arose,\n",
      "and at the same time all the negative forces of individualism\n",
      "asserted themselves. In modern times capitalism is the method for\n",
      "organizing industry and trade. It proves more effective than\n",
      "forced labor or slavery in securing combination of forces and in\n",
      "exploiting natural resources. It likewise gives extraordinary\n",
      "opportunities for the rise of men of organizing genius. The careers\n",
      "of captains of industry are more fascinating than those of old-\n",
      "time conquerors because they involve more complex situations,\n",
      "and can utilize the discoveries and labors of more men. But\n",
      "modern capitalism has been as destructive to the morality of the\n",
      "Middle Ages, or even to that of a hundred years ago, as were\n",
      "forced labor and slavery to the group life and mores which they\n",
      "destroyed.\n",
      "2. The effect of the progress of science and intelligence upon\n",
      "the mores is direct. Comparisons of the customs of one people\n",
      "with those of another bring out differences, and arouse\n",
      "questions as to the reasons for such diversity. And we have seen that\n",
      "there is more or less in the customs for which no reason can be\n",
      "given. Even if there was one originally it has been forgotten. Or\n",

      "desires. They are all variations of the effort of the living being\n",
      "first to preserve itself and then to rise to more complicated life by\n",
      "entering into more complex relations and mastering its\n",
      "environment. Spinoza's \"sui esse conservare,\" Schopenhauer's \"will to\n",
      "live,\" Nietzsche's \"will to power,\" the Hebrew's passionate ideal\n",
      "of \"life,\" and Tennyson's \"More life, and fuller\" express in\n",
      "varying degree the meaning of this elemental bent and process.\n",
      "Growing intelligence adds to its strength by giving greater capacity to\n",
      "control. Starting with organic needs, this developing life process\n",
      "may find satisfactions in the physical world in the increasing\n",
      "power and mastery over nature gained by the explorer or the\n",
      "hunter, the discoverer, the craftsman, or the artist. In the world\n",
      "of persons it displays a peculiar intensity. We note four\n",
      "tendencies toward self-assertion.\n",
      "1. The sex impulse and emotion occupies a peculiar position in\n",
      "this respect. On the one hand it is to some extent a socializing\n",
      "agency. It brings the sexes together and is thus fundamental to\n",
      "the family. But on the other hand it is constantly rebelling against\n",
      "the limits and conventions established by the social group for its\n",
      "regulation. The statutes against illicit relations, from the codes of\n",
      "Hammurabi and Moses to those of modern times, attest the\n",
      "collision between the individual's inclination and the will of the\n",
      "group. Repeatedly some passion of sex has broken over all\n",
      "social, legal, and religious sanctions. It has thus been a favorite\n",
      "theme of tragedy from the Greeks to O'Neill. Its value and\n",
      "proper regulation were points at issue in that wide-reaching\n",
      "change of mores attendant upon the Reformation, and\n",
      "apparently equilibrium has not yet been reached.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "2. In the primitive group we have seen that there might be\n",
      "private property in tools or weapons, in cattle or slaves. There was\n",
      "little private property in land under the maternal clan; and\n",
      "indeed in any case, so long as the arts were undeveloped, private\n",
      "property had necessary limits. The demand for private property\n",
      "is a natural attendant upon individual modes of industry. As we\n",
      "have said, it was a common principle that what the group\n",
      "produced was owned by the group, and what the individual made or\n",
      "captured was treated as his. When individual industry came to\n",
      "count for more, the individual claimed more and more as private\n",
      "possession.\n",
      "The change from the maternal clan to the paternal family or\n",
      "household was a reenforcement to the individual control of\n",
      "property. The father could hand down his cattle or his house to\n",
      "his son. The joint family of India is indeed a type of a paternal\n",
      "system. Nevertheless the tendency is much stronger to insist on\n",
      "individual property where the father's goods pass to his son than\n",
      "where they go to his sister's children.\n",
      "The chiefs or rulers were likely to gain the right of private\n",
      "property first. Among certain families of the South Slavs today,\n",
      "the head has his individual eating utensils, the rest share. Among\n",
      "many people the chiefs have cattle which they can dispose of as\n",
      "they will; the rest have simply their share of the kin's goods. The\n",
      "old Brehon laws of Ireland show this stage.\n",
      "But however it comes about, the very meaning of property is,\n",
      "in the first place, exclusion of others from some thing which I\n",
      "have. It is therefore in so far necessarily opposed to any such\n",
      "simple solidarity of life as we find in group morality.\n",
      "3. Struggles for mastery or liberty make for a stronger\n",
      "individual. In most cases these cannot be separated from economic\n",
      "struggles. Masters and slaves were in economic as well as\n",
      "personal relations, and nearly all class contests on a large scale have\n",
      "had at least one economic root, whatever their other sources. But\n",
      "the economic is not their only root. There have been wars for\n",
      "glory or for liberty as well as for territory or booty or slaves. As\n",
      "the struggle for existence has bred into the race the impulse to\n",
      "self-defense with its emotion of anger, the zest for rivalry and\n",
      "mastery, and the corresponding aversion to being ruled, so the\n",
      "progress of society shows trials of strength between man and\n",
      "man, kin and kin, tribe and tribe. And while, as stated in the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "preceding chapter, the cooperation made necessary in war or feud is\n",
      "a uniting force, there is another side to the story. Contests\n",
      "between individuals show who is master; contests between groups\n",
      "tend to bring forward leaders. And while such masterful men\n",
      "may serve the group they are quite as likely to find an interest in\n",
      "opposing group customs. They assert an independence of the\n",
      "group, or a mastery over it, quite incompatible with the\n",
      "solidarity of the kinship clan, although the patriarchal type of\n",
      "household under a strong head may be quite possible. There\n",
      "comes to be one code for rich and another for poor, one for\n",
      "Patricians and another for Plebs, one for baron and another for\n",
      "peasant, one for gentry and another for the common folk. For a\n",
      "time this may be accepted patiently. But when once the rich\n",
      "become arrogant, the feudal lord insolent, customs of an earlier\n",
      "day seem unjust; they no longer hold. Old ties are cast off, the\n",
      "demand for freedom and equality rises, and the collision\n",
      "between authority and liberty is on.\n",
      "Or the contest may be for intellectual liberty—for free thought\n",
      "and free speech. It is sometimes considered that such liberty\n",
      "meets its strongest opponent in the religious or ecclesiastical\n",
      "organization. There is no doubt a conservative tendency in\n",
      "religion. As we have pointed out, religion is the great conservator of\n",
      "group values and group standards. Intellectual criticism tends to\n",
      "undermine what is outgrown or merely habitual here as\n",
      "elsewhere. Rationalism or free thought has set itself in frequent\n",
      "opposition likewise to what has been claimed to be \"above reason.\"\n",
      "Nevertheless it would be absurd to attribute all the innovation to\n",
      "science and all the conservatism to religion. Scientific dogmas\n",
      "and \"idols\" are hard to displace. Schools are about as\n",
      "conservative as churches. And on the other hand the struggle for\n",
      "religious liberty has usually been carried on not by the irreligious\n",
      "but by the religious. The history of the noble army of martyrs is\n",
      "a record of appeal to individual conscience, or to an immediate\n",
      "personal relation to God, as over against the formal, the\n",
      "traditional, the organized religious customs and doctrines of their\n",
      "age. The struggle for religious toleration and religious liberty\n",
      "takes its place side by side with the struggles for intellectual and\n",
      "political liberty in the chapters of growing individuality.\n",

      "arts gives greater means for display, the desire for recognition\n",
      "has immensely greater scope. It is increased by the urge of\n",
      "emulation; it often results in envy and jealousies. It becomes then a\n",
      "powerful factor in stimulating individuality, if not individualism.\n",
      "When the group whose approval is sought is small, we have\n",
      "class standards, with all the provincialism, narrowness, and\n",
      "prejudice that belong to them. As the honor-seeker is merely\n",

      "tribes that were regarded as enemies, and visiting the iniquities\n",
      "of the fathers upon the children. How could such a deity become\n",
      "a power for right and justice, a symbol of truth, fidelity, mercy,\n",

      "standards of the city, or between rich and poor; in the administration\n",
      "of justice between man and man; in adjustments with other races\n",

      "demanded, and not uncommon, but a milder tradition sanctioned\n",
      "the substitution of a ram for a son. Yahweh could be a\n",

      "to prevent the fall of the sacred ark, and send a destroying\n",
      "pestilence upon the whole people because King David presumed to\n",

      "On the other hand passionate desire for children was matched by\n",
      "such affection as that of Jacob for Joseph and Benjamin, and for\n",

      "dropped water.\"\n",
      "After two or more centuries of struggle with varying fortunes\n",
      "under \"judges\" the people demanded a king \"that we also may\n",
      "be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go\n",
      "out before us and fight our battles.\" Saul, David, and Solomon\n",

      "successfully, and began commerce which under their successors led to\n",

      "in the South, 586 B.C. followed by exile and captivity of\n",
      "prominent Jews in Babylon, came as a crushing calamity. It set a crucial\n",
      "problem for both morals and religion. Hitherto Law and\n",
      "Prophecy had held and taught that prosperity followed faithful\n",
      "obedience to Yahweh, and that defeat was a sign of his displeasure.\n",
      "But now the faithful were scattered and captive, and the holy city\n",
      "was wasted. Was the arm of Yahweh shortened that he could not\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "save? We shall note later the struggles of prophets and sages with\n",
      "these problems. The return of the exiles, their rebuilding of the\n",
      "Temple, their patriotic resistance under the Maccabees to the\n",
      "abolition of their religion by Antiochus were evidences of the\n",
      "devotion of the remnant. The fall of Jerusalem at the hands of Titus\n",
      "and the Romans, A.D. 70, saw the destruction of the Temple, the\n",
      "end of sacrifices, and of the Jews as a nation. They still cherished\n",
      "their law and their sacred writings. But the moral ideals of their\n",
      "prophets and their vision of a better world-order of justice and\n",
      "peace lived on also in the world religion founded by the prophet\n",
      "of Nazareth, who came not to destroy but to fulfill.\n",
      "§ 2. Religious Agencies\n",
      "As already stated, the prophets were the great\n",
      "moralizing agency. But there were also other agencies which contributed\n",
      "to moral progress: the personal relation to Yahweh, as both\n",
      "friend and lawgiver; the cultus; the kingdom with its\n",
      "administration of justice; the sage.\n",
      "1. As has been brought out several times in our study, the\n",
      "fundamental source of moral conceptions of right and justice is that\n",
      "men and women live in society, in a community of some sort.\n",
      "Religion regards God as a member of such a community. This\n",
      "implies fidelity; it implies that God and people have their\n",
      "respective parts to perform in order that the community may continue\n",
      "and prosper. In a national religion this relation is narrowly\n",
      "conceived; the people is to have no other god, Yahweh is to have\n",
      "(according to earlier views) no other people. Yet this makes for a\n",
      "certain intimacy, which may be a useful stage in fostering the\n",
      "feeling of dependence and reliance upon a divine helper. It may\n",
      "also be that the covenant relation between Yahweh and Israel\n",
      "which plays so important a role in the Ten Words and the\n",
      "teachings of Deuteronomy, contributed to emphasize the voluntary\n",
      "character of the relation, and the sacredness of a solemn\n",
      "promise. On the other hand the thought of Yahweh as father, or\n",
      "husband of his people evidently sought to carry over to God the\n",
      "close ties of family care and affection.\n",
      "The conception of Yahweh as personal lawgiver came, of\n",
      "course, from the functions of a ruler in the community. This had\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "an important influence in changing the attitude toward customs.\n",
      "Yahweh's law compelled obedience or rebellion. Customs were\n",
      "either forbidden or enjoined. In either case they ceased to be\n",
      "merely customs. In the law of Israel the whole body of\n",
      "observances in private life, in ceremonial, and in legal forms, is\n",
      "introduced with a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" We know that other Semitic\n",
      "people observed the Sabbath, practiced circumcision,\n",
      "distinguished clean from unclean beasts, and respected the taboos of\n",
      "birth and death. Whether in Israel all these observances were old\n",
      "customs given new authority by statute, or were customs taken\n",
      "from other peoples under the authority of the laws of Yahweh, is\n",
      "immaterial. The ethical significance of the law is that these\n",
      "various observances, instead of being treated merely as customs, are\n",
      "regarded as personal commands of a personal deity.\n",
      "This makes a vital difference in the view taken of the violation\n",
      "of these observances. When a man violates a custom he fails to\n",
      "do the correct thing. He misses the mark. The Hebrew and Greek words for sin both mean \"to miss.\"\n",
      "3 But when the\n",
      "observance is a personal command, its violation is a personal\n",
      "disobedience; it is rebellion; it is an act of will. The evil which follows is\n",
      "no longer bad luck; it is punishment. Now punishment must be\n",
      "either right or wrong, moral or immoral. It can never be merely\n",
      "non-moral. Hence the very conception of sin as a personal\n",
      "offense, and of ill as a personal punishment, forces a moral\n",
      "judgment. In its crudest form this may take the god's commands as\n",
      "right simply because he utters them, and assume that the sufferer\n",
      "is guilty merely because he suffers.\n",
      "But side by side with the conception that the laws of Yahweh\n",
      "must be obeyed because they were his commands, there was\n",
      "another doctrine which was but an extension of the theory that the\n",
      "people had freely accepted their ruler. This was that Yahweh's\n",
      "commands were not arbitrary. They were right; they could be\n",
      "placed before the people for their approval; they were \"life\";\n",
      "\"the judge of all the earth\" would \"do right.\" We have here a\n",
      "striking illustration of the principle that moral standards, at first\n",
      "embodied in persons, slowly work free, so that persons are judged\n",
      "by them.\n",
      "2. The elaborate cultus carried on by the priests, symbolized,\n",
      "however imperfectly, certain moral ideas. The solicitous care for\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "ceremonial \"purity\" might have no direct moral value; the\n",
      "contamination from contact with birth or death or certain animals\n",
      "might be a very external sort of \"uncleanness.\" Nevertheless,\n",
      "they symbolized control by a law. The \"holiness\" of the priests,\n",
      "as set apart to special service of Yahweh, emphasized the\n",
      "seriousness of their work; and further, it contributed to a\n",
      "distinction between spiritual and material. Moreover, while part of this\n",
      "value inheres in all ritual, the contrast between Yahweh's\n",
      "worship and that of other deities challenged moral attention. The\n",
      "gods of the land, the various Baals, were worshipped \"upon\n",
      "every high hill and under every green tree.\" As gods of fertility,\n",
      "they were symbolized by the emblems of sex, and great freedom\n",
      "prevailed at their festivals. At certain shrines men and women\n",
      "gave themselves for the service of the god. Even first-born\n",
      "children were not infrequently sacrificed. These festivals and shrines\n",
      "seem to have been adopted more or less fully by Israel from the\n",
      "Canaanites, but the prophets have an utterly different idea of\n",
      "Yahweh worship. The god of Sinai rejects utterly such practices.\n",
      "License and drunkenness are not, as the cultus of Baal and\n",
      "Astarte implied, the proper symbols of life and deity.\n",
      "Moreover, one part of the cultus, the \"sin offering,\" directly\n",
      "implied transgression and the need of forgiveness. The \"sins\"\n",
      "might themselves be ceremonial rather than moral, and the\n",
      "method of removing them might be external—especially the\n",
      "process of putting the sins upon a scapegoat which should \"bear\n",
      "upon him all their iniquities into a solitary land,\"—nevertheless,\n",
      "the solemn confession, and the shedding of the blood which was\n",
      "the \"life,\" could not but remind of responsibility and deepen\n",
      "reflection. The need of atonement and reconciliation, thus\n",
      "impressed, symbolized the moral process of reconstructing, of\n",
      "putting away a lower past, and readjusting life to meet an ideal.\n",
      "3. The ecstatic trances in which the prophets were believed to\n",
      "see visions, or become entrusted with divine messages, gave them\n",
      "prestige among their people, but did not prevent them from\n",
      "keeping keen and wide-open eyes upon the events and conditions\n",
      "before them. They made kings, and watched the armies of\n",
      "Assyria and Egypt. They saw the dress of rich women and heard\n",
      "the cry of the oppressed poor. As they mused on threatened\n",
      "invasion or flagrant injustice the fire burned within. The invasion\n",
      "must be in God's plan; the injustice must bring down divine\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "wrath. From trance or vision or meditation they came with a\n",
      "\"Thus saith the Lord.\" They brought a message from a living\n",
      "source of authority, intended for the immediate situation. They\n",
      "brought a present command for a present duty. \"Thou art the\n",
      "man,\" of Nathan to David, \"Hast thou killed, and also taken\n",
      "possession?\" of Elijah to Ahab, were personal rebukes. But the\n",
      "great sermons of Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, were no less for the\n",
      "hour. A licentious festival, an Assyrian invasion, an Egyptian\n",
      "embassy, a plague of locusts, an impending captivity—these\n",
      "inspire demand for repentance, warnings of destruction, promises\n",
      "of salvation. The prophet was thus the \"living fountain.\" The\n",
      "divine will as coming through him \"was still, so to speak, fluid,\n",
      "and not congealed into institutions.\"\n",
      "In the second place, the prophets seized upon the inward\n",
      "purpose and social conduct of man as the all-important issues; cultus,\n",
      "sacrifice, are unimportant. \"I hate, I despise your feasts, and I\n",
      "will take no delight in your solemn assemblies,\" cries Amos in\n",
      "Yahweh's name, \"But let justice roll down as waters and\n",
      "righteousness as a mighty stream.\" \"I have had enough of the burnt\n",
      "offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts,\" proclaims Isaiah,\n",
      "\"new moons, and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies,—I cannot\n",
      "away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.\" You need not\n",
      "ceremonial, but moral, purity. \"Wash you, make you clean; put away\n",
      "the evil of your doings;—seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge\n",
      "the fatherless, plead for the widow.\" Micah's \"Shall I give my\n",
      "first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin\n",
      "of my soul?\" seized upon the difference once for all between the\n",
      "physical and the moral; a completely ethical standpoint is gained\n",
      "in his summary of religious duty: \"What doth God require of\n",
      "thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly\n",
      "with thy God?\" And the New Testament analogue marks the\n",
      "true ethical valuation of all the external religious manifestations,\n",
      "even of the cruder forms of prophecy itself. Gifts, mysteries,\n",
      "knowledge, or the \"body to be burned\"—there is a more\n",
      "excellent way than these. For all these are \"in part.\" Their value is but\n",
      "temporary and relative. The values that abide, that stand\n",
      "criticism, are that staking of oneself upon the truth and worth of\n",
      "one's ideal which is faith; that aspiration and forward look\n",
      "which is hope; that sum of all social charity, sympathy, justice,\n",
      "and active helpfulness, which is love. \"But the greatest of these is\n",
      "love.\"\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "4. Yahweh was the real king of Israel. The human ruler in\n",
      "Jerusalem was his representative. The expansion and glory of the\n",
      "kingdom under Solomon showed the divine favor. Division and\n",
      "calamity were not mere misfortunes, or the victory of greater\n",
      "armies; they were divine rebukes. Only in righteousness and justice\n",
      "could the nation survive. On the other hand, the confidence in\n",
      "Yahweh's love for Israel guaranteed that he would never forsake\n",
      "his people. He would purify them and redeem them even from\n",
      "the grave. He would establish a kingdom of law and peace, \"an\n",
      "everlasting kingdom that should not be destroyed.\" Politics in\n",
      "Israel had a moral goal.\n",
      "5. Sage and prophet gave to suffering a deeper significance.\n",
      "The Greek treatment of the problem of evil is found in the great\n",
      "tragedies. An ancestral curse follows down successive\n",
      "generations, dealing woe to all the unhappy house. For the victims\n",
      "there seems to be nothing but to suffer. The necessity of destiny\n",
      "makes the catastrophe sublime, but also hopeless. Ibsen's Ghosts\n",
      "is conceived in a similar spirit. There is a tremendous moral\n",
      "lesson in it for the fathers, but for the children only horror. The\n",
      "Greek and the Scandinavian are doubtless interpreting one phase\n",
      "of human life—its continuity and dependence upon cosmical\n",
      "nature. But the Hebrew was not content with this. His\n",
      "confidence in a divine government of the world forced him to seek\n",
      "some moral value, some purpose in the event. The search led\n",
      "along one path to a readjustment of values; it led by another\n",
      "path to a new view of social interdependence.\n",
      "The book of Job gives the deepest study of the first of these\n",
      "problems. The old view had been that virtue and happiness\n",
      "always went together. Prosperity meant divine favor, and therefore\n",
      "it must be good. Adversity meant divine punishment; it showed\n",
      "wrongdoing and was itself an evil. When calamity comes upon\n",
      "Job, his friends assume it to be a sure proof of his wickedness.\n",
      "He had himself held the same view, and since he refuses to admit\n",
      "his wickedness and \"holds fast to his integrity,\" it confounds all\n",
      "his philosophy of life and of God. It compels a reversal and\n",
      "revaluation of all values. If he could only meet God face to face\n",
      "and have it out with him he believes there would be some\n",
      "solution. But come what may, he will not sell his soul for happiness.\n",
      "To \"repent,\" as his friends urge, in order that he may be again on\n",
      "good terms with God, would mean for him to call sin what he\n",
      "believes to be righteousness. And he will not lie in this way. God\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "is doubtless stronger, and if he pursues his victim relentlessly,\n",
      "may convict him. But be this as it may, Job will not let go his\n",
      "fundamental consciousness of right and wrong. His \"moral self\"\n",
      "is the one anchor that holds, is the supreme value of life.\n",
      "As God liveth, who hath taken away my right,\n",
      "And the Almighty who hath vexed my soul;\n",
      "Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness.\n",
      "Till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me,\n",
      "My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go. Job 27:1-6.\n",
      "4\n",
      "Another suggestion of the book is that evil comes to prove man's\n",
      "sincerity: \"Does Job serve God for naught?\" and from that\n",
      "standpoint the answer is, Yes; he does. \"There is a disinterested love of\n",
      "God.\" Genung, Job, The Epic of the Inner Life.\n",
      "5 In this setting, also, the experience of suffering produces\n",
      "a shifting of values from the extrinsic to the internal.\n",
      "The other treatment of the problem of suffering is found in the\n",
      "latter half of Isaiah. It finds an interpretation of the problem by a\n",
      "deeper view of social interdependence, in which the old tribal\n",
      "solidarity is given, as it were, a transfigured meaning. The\n",
      "individualistic interpretation of suffering was that it meant personal\n",
      "guilt. \"We did esteem him stricken of God.\" This breaks down.\n",
      "The suffering servant is not wicked. He is suffering for others—\n",
      "in some sense. \"He hath borne our griefs and carried our\n",
      "sorrows.\" The conception here reached of an interrelation which\n",
      "implies that the good may suffer because of the sin or the\n",
      "suffering of others, and that the assuming of this burden marks the\n",
      "higher type of ethical relation, is one of the finest products of\n",
      "Israel's religion. As made central in the Christian conception of\n",
      "the Cross, it has furnished one of the great elements in the\n",
      "modern social consciousness.\n",
      "§ 3. The Moral Conceptions Attained\n",
      "1. Righteousness and sin were not exact or\n",
      "contradictory opposites. The righteous man was not necessarily sinless.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the consciousness of sin, like a dark background,\n",
      "brought out more emphatically the conception of righteousness.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "This conception had its two aspects, derived from the civil and\n",
      "the religious spheres of life—spheres which were not separate for\n",
      "the Hebrew. On the one hand, the just or righteous respected the\n",
      "moral order in human society. The unrighteous was unjust,\n",
      "extortionate, cruel. He did not respect the rights of others. On the\n",
      "other hand, the righteous man was in \"right\" relation to God.\n",
      "This right relation might be tested by the divine law; but as God\n",
      "was conceived as a living person, loving his people, \"forgiving\n",
      "iniquity, transgression, and sin,\" it might also be measured by an\n",
      "essential harmony of spirit with the divine will. There was the\n",
      "\"righteousness of the law,\" and the \"righteousness of faith.\" The\n",
      "first implies complete obedience; the second implies that in spite\n",
      "of transgressions there is room for atonement See Charles A. Dinsmore, Atonement in Literature and Life, Boston, 1906.\n",
      "6 or reconciliation.\n",
      "As the first means ethically the testing of conduct by a moral\n",
      "standard, a \"moral law,\" so the second stands for the thought\n",
      "that character is rather a matter of spirit and of constant\n",
      "reconstruction than of exact conformity, once for all, to a hard and\n",
      "fast rule. Specific acts may fail to conform, but life is more than a\n",
      "series of specific acts. The measurement of conduct by the law\n",
      "has value in quickening a sense of shortcoming, but alone it may\n",
      "also lead either to self-righteous complacency or to despair. The\n",
      "possibility of new adjustment, of renewal, of \"a new birth,\"\n",
      "means liberation and life. As such it may be contrasted with the\n",
      "Buddhist doctrine of Karma, the causality from which there is no\n",
      "escape but by the extinction of desire.\n",
      "\"Sin\" had likewise its various aspects. It stood for missing the\n",
      "mark, for violating the rules of clean and unclean; but it stood\n",
      "also for personal disobedience to the divine will, for violation of\n",
      "the moral order of Israel. In this latter sense, as identified by the\n",
      "prophets with social unrighteousness, it is a significant ethical\n",
      "conception. It brings out the point that evil and wrongdoing are\n",
      "not merely individual matters, not merely failures; they are\n",
      "offences against a law which is above the private self, against a\n",
      "moral order which has its rightful demands upon us.\n",
      "2. The transition from group to individual responsibility was\n",
      "thoroughly worked out by the prophets, even if they were not\n",
      "able to carry full popular assent. In early days the whole kin was\n",
      "treated as guilty for the offense of the kinsman. Achan's case has\n",
      "already been cited; and in the case of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "\"Their wives and their sons and their little ones\" were all treated\n",
      "alike. Numbers 16; Joshua 7.\n",
      "7 In like manner, the family of the righteous man shared\n",
      "in the divine favor. The later prophets pronounced a radical\n",
      "change. The proverb, \"The fathers have eaten sour grapes and\n",
      "the children's teeth are set on edge,\" is no more to be used,\n",
      "declares Ezekiel, speaking for Yahweh. \"The soul that sinneth, it\n",
      "shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither\n",
      "shall the father bear the iniquity of the son\"; and it is especially\n",
      "interesting to note that the Lord is represented as pleading with\n",
      "the people that this is fair, while the people say, \"Wherefore doth\n",
      "not the son bear the iniquity of the father?\" The solidarity of the\n",
      "family resisted the individualism of the prophetic conception,\n",
      "and five hundred years after Ezekiel the traces of the older\n",
      "conception still lingered in the question, \"Who did sin, this man or\n",
      "his parents, that he was born blind?\" John 9:2.\n",
      "8 For another aspect of\n",
      "responsibility, viz., intent, as distinct from accidental action, Hammurabi's code showed a disregard of intent which would make surgery a\n",
      "dangerous profession: \"If a physician operate on a man for a severe wound\n",
      "with a bronze lancet and cause the man's death; or open an abscess [in the eye]\n",
      "of a man with a bronze lancet and destroy the man's eye, they shall cut off his\n",
      "fingers.\" Early German and English law is just as naïve. If a weapon was left to\n",
      "be repaired at a smith's and was then caught up or stolen and used to do harm,\n",
      "the original owner was held responsible.\n",
      "9 we\n",
      "have certain transitional steps shown in the interesting \"cities of\n",
      "refuge\" Numbers 35; Deuteronomy 19; Joshua 20.\n",
      "10 for the accidental homicide in which he might be safe\n",
      "from the avenger of blood, provided he was swift enough of foot\n",
      "to reach a city of refuge before he was caught. But the fullest\n",
      "development in the ethics of responsibility along this line seemed to\n",
      "take the form described under the next head.\n",
      "3. Sincerity and purity of heart came to be essential qualities.\n",
      "The Hebrew had a philosophy of conduct which made it chiefly\n",
      "a matter of \"wisdom\" and \"folly,\" but the favorite term of\n",
      "prophet and psalmist to symbolize the central principle was\n",
      "rather \"the heart.\" This term stood for the voluntary disposition,\n",
      "especially in its inner springs of emotions and sentiments,\n",
      "affections and passions. The Greek was inclined to look askance at\n",
      "this side of life, to regard the emotions as perturbations of the\n",
      "soul, and to seek their control by reason, or even their repression\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "or elimination. The Hebrew found a more positive value in the\n",
      "emotional side of conduct, and at the same time worked out\n",
      "the conception of a sincere and thoroughgoing interest as lying\n",
      "at the very root of all right life. The religious influence was as\n",
      "elsewhere the important agency. \"Man looketh on the outward\n",
      "appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,\" \"If I regard\n",
      "iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,\" are characteristic\n",
      "expressions. A divine vision, which penetrates to the deepest\n",
      "springs of purpose and feeling, will not tolerate pretense. Nor\n",
      "will it be satisfied with anything less than entire devotion: the\n",
      "Israelite must serve Yahweh with all his heart. Outer conformity\n",
      "is not enough: \"Rend your heart and not your garments.\" It is\n",
      "the \"pure in heart\" who have the beatific vision. Not external\n",
      "contacts, or ceremonial \"uncleanness,\" on which earlier ritual\n",
      "had insisted, defile the man, but rather what proceeds from the\n",
      "heart. For the heart is the source of evil thoughts and evil deeds. Mark 7:1-23.\n",
      "11\n",
      "And conversely, the interests, the emotions, and enthusiasms\n",
      "which make up the man's deepest self do not spring forth in a\n",
      "vacuum; they go with the steadfast purpose and bent, with the\n",
      "self of achievement. \"Where your treasure is, there will your\n",
      "heart be also.\"\n",
      "Purity of motive in a full moral consciousness means not only\n",
      "(formal) sincerity, but sincere love of good and right. This was\n",
      "not stated by the Hebrew in abstract terms, but in the personal\n",
      "language of love to God. In early days there had been more or\n",
      "less of external motives in the appeals of the law and the\n",
      "prophets. Fear of punishment, hope of reward, blessings in basket and\n",
      "store, curses in land and field, were used to induce fidelity. But\n",
      "some of the prophets sought a deeper view, which seems to have\n",
      "been reached in the bitterness of human experience. Hosea's wife\n",
      "had forsaken him, and should not the love of people to Yahweh\n",
      "be as personal and sincere as that of wife to husband? She had\n",
      "said, \"I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my\n",
      "water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.\" Hosea 2:5.\n",
      "12 Is not\n",
      "serving God for hire a form of prostitution? H. P. Smith, Old Testament History, p. 222.\n",
      "13 The calamities of the\n",
      "nation tested the disinterestedness of its fidelity. They were the\n",
      "challenge of the Adversary, \"Doth Job fear God for naught?\"\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "And a remnant at least attested that fidelity did not depend on\n",
      "rewards. The moral maxim that virtue is its own reward is put in\n",
      "personal terms by the prophet after the exile:\n",
      "For though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit\n",
      "be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields\n",
      "shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold,\n",
      "and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in\n",
      "the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation. Habakkuk 3:17, 18.\n",
      "14\n",
      "4. The content of Israel's moral ideal on its individual side was\n",
      "expressed by the term \"Life.\" All the blessings that the leader of\n",
      "Israel could offer his people were summarized in the phrase, \"I\n",
      "have set before you life and death; wherefore choose life.\" The\n",
      "same final standard of value appears in the question of Jesus,\n",
      "\"What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his\n",
      "own life?\" When we inquire what life meant, we must infer so\n",
      "far as the early sources give us data for judgment, that it was\n",
      "measured largely in terms of material comfort and prosperity,\n",
      "accompanied by the satisfaction of standing in right relations to\n",
      "the god and ruler. The latter element was so closely united with\n",
      "the first that it was practically identical with it. If the people\n",
      "were prosperous they might assume that they were right; if they\n",
      "suffered they were surely wrong. Good and evil were, therefore,\n",
      "in this stage, measured largely in terms of pleasure and pain. The\n",
      "end to be sought and the ideal to be kept in mind was that of\n",
      "long and prosperous life—\"in her right hand length of days, in\n",
      "her left hand riches and honor.\" Intellectual and esthetic\n",
      "interests were not prized as such. The knowledge which was valued\n",
      "was the wisdom for the conduct of life, of which the beginning\n",
      "and crown was \"the fear of the Lord.\" The art which was valued\n",
      "was sacred song or poetry. But the ideal values which came to\n",
      "bulk most in the expanding conception of \"life\" were those\n",
      "of personal relation. Family ties, always strong among Oriental\n",
      "peoples, gained in purity. Love between the sexes was refined and\n",
      "idealized. The Song of Songs.\n",
      "15 National feeling took on added dignity, because of\n",
      "the consciousness of a divine mission. Above all, personal union\n",
      "with God, as voiced in the psalms and prophets, became the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "desire. He, and not his gifts, was the supreme good. He was the\n",
      "\"fountain of life.\" His likeness would satisfy. In his light the\n",
      "faithful would see light.\n",
      "But even more significant than any specific content put into\n",
      "the term \"life,\" was what was involved in the idea itself. The\n",
      "legalists had attempted to define conduct by a code, but there was\n",
      "an inherent vitality in the ideal of life, which refused to be\n",
      "measured or bounded. The \"words of eternal life,\" which began the\n",
      "new moral movement of Christianity, had perhaps little definite\n",
      "content to the fishermen, and it is not easy to say just what they\n",
      "meant in moral terms to the writer of the Fourth Gospel who\n",
      "uses the phrase so often. With Paul, life as the realm of the spirit\n",
      "gets definition as it stands over against the \"death\" of sin and\n",
      "lust. But with all writers of Old or New Testament, whatever\n",
      "content it had, life meant above all the suggestion of something\n",
      "beyond, the gleam and dynamic power of a future not yet\n",
      "understood. It meant to Paul a progress which was governed not by\n",
      "law or \"rudiments,\" but by freedom. Such a life would set itself\n",
      "new and higher standards; the laws and customs that had\n",
      "obtained were felt to be outgrown. The significance of early\n",
      "Christianity as a moral movement, aside from its elements of personal\n",
      "devotion and social unity to be noticed, was the spirit of\n",
      "movement, the sense of newly forming horizons beyond the old, the\n",
      "conviction that as sons of God its followers had boundless\n",
      "possibilities, that they were not the children of the bondwoman, but\n",
      "of the free.\n",
      "5. The social ideal of a community in which justice, peace, and\n",
      "love should be controlling principles, was a crowning\n",
      "achievement of Hebrew-Christian religion and morality. We have seen\n",
      "how this ideal was framed in the setting of a kingdom of God. At\n",
      "first national, it became universal, and with a fraternity which\n",
      "the world is far from having realized, it was to know \"neither\n",
      "Jew nor Greek, bond nor free.\" At first military, it took on with\n",
      "seer and psalmist the form of a reign of peace and justice. After\n",
      "the fierce and crude powers typified by the lion and the bear and\n",
      "the leopard had passed, the seer saw a kingdom represented by a\n",
      "human form. Such a kingdom it was that should not pass away.\n",
      "Such was the kingdom \"not of this world\" which Jesus presented\n",
      "as his message. Membership in this moral kingdom was for the\n",
      "poor in spirit, the pure in heart, the merciful, the peace-makers,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the hungerers after righteousness. Greatness in this moral\n",
      "community was to depend on service, not on power. The king should\n",
      "not fail till he had \"set justice in the earth.\" He should \"deliver\n",
      "the needy, and the poor.\"\n",
      "Certain features of this ideal order have since found\n",
      "embodiment in social and political structures; certain features remain\n",
      "for the future. Certain periods in history have transferred the\n",
      "ideal entirely to another world, regarding human society as\n",
      "hopelessly given over to evil. Such theories find a morality possible\n",
      "only by renouncing society. The Hebrews presented rather the\n",
      "ideal of a moral order on earth, of a control of all life by right, of\n",
      "a realization of good, and of a completeness of life. It was an\n",
      "ideal not dreamed out in ecstatic visions of pure fancy, but\n",
      "worked out in struggle and suffering, in confidence that moral\n",
      "efforts are not hopeless or destined to defeat. The ideal order is\n",
      "to be made real. The divine kingdom is to come, the divine will\n",
      "to be done \"on earth as it is in heaven.\"\n",

      "§ 1. The Fundamental Notes\n",
      "The Hebrew moral life was developed under the\n",
      "relation, first of the people, then of the individuals, to God—a\n",
      "relation at once of union and of conflict. It was out of the relation of\n",
      "the individual to social traditions and political order that the\n",
      "Greek came to full consciousness of moral law on the one hand,\n",
      "and a moral personality on the other. And just as in Jewish life\n",
      "the law and the prophets (or, later, the \"law and the gospel\")\n",
      "stood for the conflicting forces, so in Greek life the opposition\n",
      "between the authority of the group, embodied in custom and\n",
      "institutions, on the one hand, and the urgent claims of developing\n",
      "personality, manifest in both intelligence and desire, on the other,\n",
      "found expression in contrasted terms. The authority of the group\n",
      "embodied in customs and institutions, came to be regarded by\n",
      "the radicals as relatively external, artificial, and rigid. It was\n",
      "dubbed \"convention,\" or \"institution\" (thesis, what is set up).\n",
      "The rapidly developing intelligence challenged the merely\n",
      "customary and traditional; the increasing individuality challenged\n",
      "the superior authority of the group, especially when this\n",
      "manifested itself apparently in a government of force. Personal\n",
      "intelligence and personal feeling asserted a more elemental claim, as if\n",
      "they were rooted in a more original source; this source was\n",
      "called \"nature\" (physis). Social tradition and authority,\n",
      "individual reason and feeling, thus confronted each other as\n",
      "\"convention\" and \"nature.\" It was a struggle which has its analogy in the\n",
      "development of many a young man or young woman who is\n",
      "emerging from parental control to self-direction. But in Greek\n",
      "life more distinctly than elsewhere we see the steps of the process\n",
      "as a civic and not merely an individual development. Aeschylus,\n",
      "Sophocles, and Euripides presented this conflict of the individual\n",
      "with law or destiny as the great, oft-repeated tragedy of human\n",

      "Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cynics, Cyrenaics, Epicureans, and Stoics\n",
      "took part in the theoretical discussions.\n",
      "The fundamental note of all Greek life, before, during, and\n",
      "after this development, was Measure, Order, Proportion. This\n",
      "note found expression in religion, science, art, and conduct.\n",
      "Among their gods, the Greeks set Moira, \"Destiny,\" and Themis,\n",
      "\"Custom,\" \"Law,\" \"Right.\" They found order in the universe,\n",
      "which on this account they called the \"cosmos.\" They expressed\n",
      "it in their arts, especially in architecture, sculpture, the choral\n",
      "dance, and the more highly developed tragedy or lyric:\n",
      "\"And all life is full of them [of form and measure],\" says\n",
      "Plato, \"as well as every constructive and creative art. And\n",

      "The terms Just and Justice were not of course merely synonyms\n",
      "for order and measure. They had likewise the social significance\n",
      "coming from the courts and the assembly. They stood for the\n",

      "desire. But as compared with the Hebrew conception of\n",
      "righteousness, they meant much less a conformity to a law divine or\n",
      "human which had been already set up as standard, and much\n",
      "more, an ordering, a regulating, a harmonizing. The rational\n",
      "element of measure or order was more prominent than the personal\n",
      "note of authority. Hence we shall find Plato passing easily back\n",
      "and forth between justice or order in the individual and justice\n",
      "or order in the State. On the other hand, the radicals of the day\n",
      "could seize upon the legal usage and declare that justice or the\n",

      "Plato and Aristotle take up boldly the challenge of\n",
      "individualism. It may indeed be granted that existing States are too\n",
      "often ruled by classes. There are oligarchies in which the soldier\n",
      "or the rich control for their own interests; there are tyrannies in\n",

      "democracies (Plato was an aristocrat) in which the mob bears rule, and\n",
      "those who flatter and feed its passions are in authority. But all\n",
      "these do but serve to bring out more clearly the conception of a\n",
      "true State, in which the rule is by the wisest and best and is not\n",
      "for the interest of a class, but for the welfare of all. Even as it\n",
      "was, the State of Athens in Plato's day—except when it\n",
      "condemned a Socrates—meant completeness and freedom of life. It\n",
      "represented not merely a police force to protect the individual,\n",
      "but stood for the complete organization of all the life which\n",
      "needs cooperation and mutual support. The State provided\n",
      "instruction for the mind and training for the body. It surrounded\n",
      "the citizen with an atmosphere of beauty and provided in the\n",
      "tragedy and comedy opportunities for every citizen to consider\n",
      "the larger significance of life or to join in the contagious\n",
      "sympathy of mirth. In festivals and solemn processions it brought the\n",
      "citizen into unity of religious feeling. To be an Athenian citizen\n",
      "meant to share in all the higher possibilities which life afforded.\n",
      "Interpreting this life, Aristotle proclaims that it is not in\n",
      "isolation, but in the State, that \"the goal of full independence may be\n",
      "said to be first attained.\"\n",
      "Aristotle goes directly to the heart of the problem as to what is\n",
      "natural by asserting that nature is not to be found in the crude\n",
      "beginning, but rather in the complete development. \"The nature\n",
      "of anything, e.g., of a man, a horse, or a house, may be defined to\n",
      "be its condition when the process of production is complete.\"\n",
      "Hence the State \"in which alone completeness of life is attained\"\n",
      "is in the highest sense natural:\n",
      "\"The object proposed or the complete development of a\n",
      "thing is its highest good; but independence which is first\n",

      "man is naturally a political animal and that one who is not\n",
      "a citizen of any State, if the cause of his isolation be natural\n",

      "not merely the goal of the individual's development, but the\n",
      "source of his life.\n",
      "Again in the order of nature the State is prior to the\n",
      "household or individual. For the whole must needs be prior to its\n",
      "part. For instance, if you take away the body which is the\n",
      "whole, there will not remain any such thing as a hand or\n",
      "foot, unless we use the same word in a different sense, as\n",
      "when we speak of a stone hand as a hand. For a hand\n",
      "separated from the body will be a disabled hand; whereas it is the\n",
      "faculty or function of a thing which makes it what it is, and\n",
      "therefore when things lose their function or faculty, it is not\n",
      "correct to call them the same things, but rather\n",
      "homonymous, i.e., different things having the same name. We see,\n",
      "then, the State is a natural institution, and also that it is prior\n",
      "to the individual. For if the individual as a separate unit is\n",
      "not independent, he must be a part and must bear the same\n",
      "relation to the State as the other parts to their wholes; and\n",
      "one who is incapable of association with others or is\n",

      "man who knows, is the suitable ruler for our ideal community.\n",
      "The soldier may defend, the artisan may support, but the\n",

      "permanent institutions.\n",
      "§ 1. Roman Society\n",
      "Three characteristics of Roman society may be noted as\n",
      "significant for our purpose: (1) It was preeminently a political,\n",
      "i.e., a governing society. Problems of authority and power were\n",
      "foremost. (2) It was a society in which class distinctions on the\n",
      "one hand, and far-reaching, world-wide rule on the other, were\n",
      "present side by side. Patrician power and slavery found extreme\n",
      "expression; so likewise did widespread toleration and a leveling of\n",
      "such cultural barriers as those which separated Greeks from\n",
      "barbarians, and such religious barriers as separated Jews from\n",
      "Gentiles. (3) It was a society in which wealth took its place side by\n",
      "side with political power. In neither Greece nor Judaea had there\n",
      "been any such enormous fortunes. Nor on the other hand had\n",
      "there been such opening up of the world through trade and such\n",
      "a developed law of business and property.\n",
      "These outstanding traits of Roman purpose and character are\n",
      "expressed or suggested by their art and literature, and especially\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "by their architecture. The highest art of the Hebrews was their\n",
      "lyric or prophetic poetry on the one hand, and their dramatic\n",
      "statement of the problem of evil upon the other. The Greek\n",
      "found expression for his sense of beauty through the whole\n",
      "range of the arts, but in his architecture and sculpture it was\n",
      "beauty as contrasted with grandeur that was dominant. It was\n",
      "enlisted in the service of a religion not too awe-inspiring or\n",
      "remote from human life, or in the service of such patriotic subjects\n",
      "as the victors in the Olympian games. The subjects of Roman\n",
      "architecture include indeed temples for the gods, constructed for\n",
      "the most part from Grecian models, but their most characteristic\n",
      "structures are for public use such as bridges, aqueducts, fora, or\n",
      "as monumental tributes to glory and conquest, such as the\n",
      "magnificent triumphal arches, or finally as structures for luxury and\n",
      "public spectacles, such as the baths, the theaters, the circuses, of\n",
      "which latter the Colosseum early took its place among the seven\n",
      "wonders of the world. In letters, the work through which most\n",
      "students are introduced to the study of Latin is a compressed\n",
      "record of conquest by the Romans under the command of Caesar.\n",
      "This is usually followed by examples of oratory called out by a\n",
      "political crisis. The strongest department of Roman literature\n",
      "is, however, generally considered to be its satire, in which the\n",
      "luxuries, vices, and political problems of the time afford rich\n",
      "material.\n",
      "1. We know too little as yet about the characteristics of\n",
      "different races and the extent to which these depend upon physical\n",
      "and physiological causes on the one hand, or upon geographic\n",
      "and other environmental conditions on the other, to speak with\n",
      "any confidence as to why the Romans early showed ability in an\n",
      "unusual degree to play the part of a governing people. So far as\n",
      "the stock from which they sprang was concerned, it seems to\n",
      "have been in general that from which other European groups—\n",
      "Greeks, Celts, Germans—came. The beginnings, so far as we can\n",
      "gather them, were small enough. A little group of sturdy\n",
      "warriors in which the clan or patriarchal household was strongly\n",
      "developed had conflict after conflict with adjacent tribes,\n",
      "sometimes conquering, sometimes uniting on terms of mutual\n",
      "adjustment, seldom showing the disposition to exterminate, until it\n",
      "was strong enough to challenge and overcome the leading\n",
      "commercial rival, Carthage. Thenceforth Rome moved on with the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "resistless power of a machine, not merely conquering, but\n",
      "organizing the districts and peoples that were conquered, until the\n",
      "Mediterranean became a Roman lake, and the Empire extended\n",
      "from the northern regions of Britain to the borders of India,\n",
      "including within its bounds the territories of the earlier empires of\n",
      "Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Macedonia. Trade routes were\n",
      "secured, roads penetrated and united distant regions, a common\n",
      "language made Europe capable of unity in its culture and\n",
      "civilization, even though it was not able to displace Greek in the\n",
      "eastern regions of the Empire.\n",
      "To govern and administer this great territory of different races\n",
      "and cultures required the development of government on a far\n",
      "greater scale than had existed before. The Senate, representing\n",
      "the older patrician families, was enlarged by new blood. New\n",
      "officers were selected from time to time. A system of law for\n",
      "citizens, and another system for the various residents of Rome and\n",
      "of the outlying regions who were not citizens, were developed.\n",
      "Able young men saw the pathway to glory to lie through\n",
      "government. Those who were rich spent huge sums to be elected to\n",
      "office, and even those who had no ancestral wealth on which to\n",
      "depend seemed able to borrow large amounts. The expectation\n",
      "was that after holding office for a term of years at Rome, the\n",
      "successful candidate would then in due course be entrusted with the\n",
      "government of a province. This would give opportunity to pay\n",
      "off debts incurred and to amass a fortune besides.\n",
      "Our opinion of the government of Rome under the Empire is\n",
      "probably colored strongly by the evil reputations of some of its\n",
      "worst rulers. Nero is more widely known than Marcus Aurelius.\n",
      "But in considering the Roman ability for government, we have to\n",
      "remember that, although in Western Europe the Empire finally\n",
      "succumbed to the invasions of the barbarians, it yet continued\n",
      "for more than four centuries after the time of Augustus; that\n",
      "even when Romans by birth no longer wielded its authority the\n",
      "pattern lived on for other centuries; that its forms and structures\n",
      "and much of the law which the Romans developed are still a\n",
      "power in Europe and in lesser degree in America.\n",
      "2. From early times the old families, the patricians, who were\n",
      "descended from the conquering group, held themselves above\n",
      "their vassals or clients, and above the conquered groups that\n",
      "were allowed to carry on agriculture and various crafts under the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "rule of the conquerors. These subordinate groups, the plebeians,\n",
      "struggled with more or less success for a share in power. The\n",
      "Romans were on the whole liberal in admitting to citizenship\n",
      "various tribes and peoples whom they conquered or with whom they\n",
      "united on terms of mutual adjustment. But the aristocratic great\n",
      "families of the patricians were very skilful in keeping the main\n",
      "power in their own hands, and even after the Senate, composed\n",
      "originally of patricians, lost the controlling power the social\n",
      "distinction remained. That the Senate was able to maintain itself so\n",
      "long was due in part to the fact that, although grudgingly, it did\n",
      "admit a rather constant stream of new blood from the more\n",
      "ambitious of the lower orders, especially from the great business\n",
      "class, usually called knights.\n",
      "At the bottom were the slaves. Early Roman citizens were\n",
      "largely farmers with small holdings who worked with their own\n",
      "hands side by side with their servants. As the result of successful\n",
      "wars great numbers of conquered peoples were enslaved, and in\n",
      "many cases treated with severity. The elder Cato taught that they\n",
      "should be kept at work when not asleep, worked as hard as\n",
      "possible, and sold or left to perish when too old to work longer.\n",
      "They had become so numerous in 74 B.C. as to attempt a revolt\n",
      "under Spartacus, the Gladiator, and when they had been\n",
      "defeated six thousand were crucified along the road from Capua\n",
      "to Rome. Some slaves were educated men. The philosopher\n",
      "Epictetus was of this type. Many slaves gained their liberty in\n",
      "one way or another and were called freedmen. These might enter\n",
      "trades and retail business which the older citizen was taught to\n",
      "despise. Masters were later deprived of the power of life and\n",
      "death over their slaves. But the institution of slavery remained as\n",
      "a corner stone of Roman industry and a factor in Roman society.\n",
      "Yet despite this sharp distinction between classes Rome\n",
      "became a powerful agency for the leveling of barriers between\n",
      "racial and language groups. So far as language and commerce were\n",
      "concerned the Romans were but carrying further the influences\n",
      "already set in motion by the Greeks in the Macedonian Empire.\n",
      "But as the Roman administration continued for generation after\n",
      "generation, the numerous tribal groups of Italy, of Gaul, of\n",
      "Spain, gradually forgot their ancient feuds and became members,\n",
      "as citizens, or subjects, of a great commonwealth. The pax\n",
      "Romana, even though enforced by power, was a uniting and\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "harmonizing atmosphere. The basis was prepared for the remarkable\n",
      "declarations of the unity and equality of mankind which will be\n",
      "cited under Section 2 from Cicero and the Roman jurists.\n",
      "3. The conquests of Rome brought in vast wealth to certain\n",
      "classes of citizens. On the one hand, governors of provinces, on\n",
      "the other, business men who acted as farmers of taxes, found the\n",
      "provinces of Sicily and Asia Minor a gold mine. The governor\n",
      "counted upon his haul to pay off enormous debts, and to amass\n",
      "resources for future needs. For to gain and keep office was\n",
      "expensive. The candidate might spend huge sums in distributing bread\n",
      "and entertainment—panem et circenses—for the multitude.\n",
      "Wealthy citizens also lavished money upon estates, villas,\n",
      "luxurious baths, works of art, upon feasts and all the sources of\n",
      "pleasure for body or mind which the age could provide. At Rome\n",
      "one saw, not only, as at Athens, the splendor of public buildings,\n",
      "but also the luxuries of private dwellings upon a scale surpassing\n",
      "anything the world had seen before. The satirists have portrayed\n",
      "the extravagant excesses of the feasts, and complain of the\n",
      "deterioration of character which these implied.\n",
      "But along with evil effects from wealth came also certain\n",
      "goods. One was the indirect aid which the possession of\n",
      "property gave to improving the status of woman, and especially of\n",
      "married women. In the earlier patrician, patriarchal household\n",
      "the woman at marriage passed from the manus of the father to\n",
      "that of the husband. The matron held a position of dignity, but\n",
      "she was not a \"person\" before the law. In the words of Bryce,\n",
      "\"One can hardly imagine a more absolute subjection to one\n",
      "person of another person who was nevertheless not only free but\n",
      "respected and influential, as we know that the wife in old Rome\n",
      "was.\" As wealth and property increased the father naturally grew\n",
      "disinclined to see his daughter's dowry pass out of his family into\n",
      "that of the husband. Other forms of marriage than that of manus,\n",
      "which allowed greater freedom and independence to the wife,\n",
      "gradually superseded the older type. \"The Roman matron of the\n",
      "Empire,\" says Hobhouse, \"was more fully her own mistress than\n",
      "the married woman of any earlier civilization, with the possible\n",
      "exception of a certain period of Egyptian history, and it must be\n",
      "added, than the wife of any later civilization down to our own\n",
      "generation.\" Ulpian, the jurist, held that the consent of the\n",
      "parties, as well as that of the guardians, was essential to\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "marriage. Doubtless other factors contributed to the liberalizing of\n",
      "woman's status, but the possession of wealth and property was\n",
      "influential.\n",
      "§ 2. Moral Ideas\n",
      "The important moral ideas in such a society as that of\n",
      "Rome would naturally be closely connected with problems of\n",
      "government, or of business. Besides these spheres of action, it\n",
      "would be expected that the family would be affected by the\n",
      "growth of wealth, and that in their private life wealthy citizens\n",
      "would be inclined to a philosophy which would justify their\n",
      "luxurious tastes. To find guiding ideas with which to meet their\n",
      "problems, the Romans went to the Greeks. They were not\n",
      "themselves philosophical by nature. They had, of course, as every\n",
      "coherent group of strong character must have, their own mores.\n",
      "The family was of the patriarchal type; the husband and father\n",
      "had great authority over the whole household, including even, in\n",
      "the earlier years, power of life and death over children, and\n",
      "slaves. They were strictly monogamous, and in the earlier years\n",
      "there was little divorce. But the most interesting and important\n",
      "ideas for our purpose were those which grew out of their\n",
      "political and business activities, and these ideas were based to a great\n",
      "extent upon Stoic doctrines. The more important of these\n",
      "doctrines which found expression in Roman law and thereby were\n",
      "handed down to modern times as elements not only of our law,\n",
      "but of our morals, are (1) the conception of nature as a source of\n",
      "universal law; (2) the conception of Reason as the essential\n",
      "principle of nature; (3) the conception that all men share in reason,\n",
      "and therefore are equal; (4) the conception that justice is the\n",
      "rightful test of government; (5) the conception of duty.\n",
      "1. We have seen in the preceding chapter that the Greeks\n",
      "debated whether governments and laws were natural or\n",
      "conventional, and that Aristotle pointed out the twofold meaning of the\n",
      "word \"natural\" as signifying on the one hand what is original,\n",
      "and on the other what characterizes full development or\n",
      "perfection. From this second point of view, Aristotle argued, the State\n",
      "is natural because in it man reaches full development. The Greek\n",
      "was likely to think of Athens or some other Greek city when\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "considering the State. The conquests of Alexander did much to\n",
      "break down local feeling, and the Greek Stoics declared\n",
      "themselves not citizens of Athens, but citizens of the world. But when\n",
      "the Romans had actually brought the world under one sway, the\n",
      "conception of universal law, governing everywhere, gained a\n",
      "concrete expression. Instead of a patchwork of tribes and peoples\n",
      "with their own laws and customs, the consciousness of\n",
      "something like a common humanity found expression not only in the\n",
      "homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto of the dramatist\n",
      "Terence, but in the philosophical writings of Cicero, Seneca, and\n",
      "the jurists. To find the source of authority that should be\n",
      "adequate for a law binding the whole world, the Roman\n",
      "philosophers adopted the Greek conception of nature as the all-inclusive\n",
      "essence or order of the universe, more fundamental, if possible,\n",
      "than even the gods themselves, although at other times it is\n",
      "spoken of as the \"divine law of eternal and immutable morality.\"\n",
      "2. Nature in this sense was by the Stoics regarded as through\n",
      "and through rational. The law of nature is therefore rational and\n",
      "universal.\n",
      "True law is indeed right reason, conformable to Nature,\n",
      "pervading all things, constant, eternal; . . . It is not lawful to\n",
      "alter this law, to derogate from it, or to repeal it. . . . Nor\n",
      "will it be one law for Rome and another for Athens; one\n",
      "thing to-day and another to-morrow; but it is a law eternal\n",
      "and unchangeable for all people and in every age; and it\n",
      "becomes as it were the one common god, master, and governor\n",
      "of all. Cicero, Republic, III., 22.\n",
      "1\n",
      "This conception of a universal law governing all men was given a\n",
      "more concrete setting by the actual legal development at Rome.\n",
      "The early customs and law of the city were naturally those of the\n",
      "tribes which made up the ruling class. These continued to be\n",
      "known as the law of the citizens, or as the lex civilis. But there\n",
      "were many dwelling at Rome who were not citizens, and there\n",
      "were, besides, the inhabitants of outlying regions, who were\n",
      "constantly having relations of trade or seeking decisions from the\n",
      "Roman government in their contesting claims. For all these\n",
      "classes of persons the Romans gradually developed what they\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "called a law of tribes or peoples (ius gentium). To introduce\n",
      "some sort of consistency into this law, the judges would naturally\n",
      "rely on what might be called \"reason.\" As time went on, under\n",
      "the influence of the Stoic philosophy they worked out certain\n",
      "principles which they regarded as prescribed by reason, such as\n",
      "\"good faith,\" and in general they distinguished between \"strict\n",
      "law,\" and what was fair and good or humane (ius aequum et\n",
      "bonum). This latter as the law of reason was also the law of\n",
      "nature. Here, then, was a great conception, scarcely possible\n",
      "when mankind was split up into local groups, which was handed\n",
      "down through the Middle Ages as a permanent possession for all\n",
      "who came under the influence of the Roman civilization. As\n",
      "embodied in the famous Code of Justinian it became the law for the\n",
      "Eastern Empire as well.\n",
      "3. Aristotle in the Politics held that men belong to two types,\n",
      "one capable of directing, the other needing to be directed and\n",
      "controlled; hence the reason for slavery. A remarkable change is\n",
      "found in the writings of Cicero and Seneca. As already\n",
      "suggested, the Stoic conception of nature was that it was but\n",
      "another word for reason. Gods and men share in reason, which\n",
      "makes them\n",
      "fellow citizens of one city and commonwealth. . . . Man is\n",
      "born for justice. . . . There is no one thing more like to\n",
      "another, a more homogeneous and analogous, than man is to\n",
      "man. And if the corruption of customs, and the variation of\n",
      "opinions, had not induced an imbecility of minds, and turned\n",
      "them aside from the course of nature, no one would more\n",
      "nearly resemble himself than all men would resemble all men.\n",
      "Therefore whatever definition we give of man, it must\n",
      "include the whole human race. Cicero, De Legibus.\n",
      "2\n",
      "So too Seneca: \"We are all descended from one common parent,\n",
      "the world. It is fortune that makes a man a slave.\" Slavery is only\n",
      "external, only affects the body of a man. The body may belong to\n",
      "a master, the mind is its own. The lawyers had to recognize\n",
      "slavery as a fact, and although its conditions were from time to time\n",
      "somewhat ameliorated by restricting the powers of the master,\n",
      "no one thought of abolishing it. Nevertheless, they recognized\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "that slavery was contrary to nature. One of them, Ulpian, says\n",
      "that, so far as concerns the civil law, slaves are held as if not\n",
      "counting (pro nullis); but this is not so by natural law, because as\n",
      "regards natural law, all men are equal. And another jurist, using\n",
      "words which later had power to thrill the men of the American\n",
      "and French Revolutions, wrote, \"By natural law, from the\n",
      "beginning all men were born free.\" Sometimes ideas are uttered by\n",
      "prophets and thinkers which are destined to wait years or\n",
      "centuries for their fulfillment. Such were the ideas of natural liberty\n",
      "and equality of all men. But it is to the glory of these Roman\n",
      "thinkers that they framed words which could later become the\n",
      "watchwords of great movements for human liberation.\n",
      "4. As law is the fundamental principle of nature and of the\n",
      "universe, so law and justice (which is only another name for that\n",
      "law which is the true law of nature) form the basis of that\n",
      "association of men which we call a commonwealth. The\n",
      "commonwealth, says Cicero, is the affair of the people, but the people is\n",
      "not every sort of aggregation of men, but an association united\n",
      "by a compact of law, and by participation in common utility.\n",
      "Like the sentiments concerning equality and liberty in the\n",
      "preceding paragraph, this definition of a commonwealth might be\n",
      "regarded as an ideal rather than as corresponding precisely to\n",
      "the actual conditions in the Empire. Nevertheless, in the two\n",
      "hundred years of peace which followed the reign of Augustus,\n",
      "there was a large measure of justice in the imperial law, and the\n",
      "common well-being which made property and commerce and\n",
      "industry reasonably secure was measurably realized. And like the\n",
      "doctrines of equality and liberty, this conception of law and\n",
      "justice as the true test of authority found a very real application in\n",
      "later times. We can trace its influence in the doctrine that law is a\n",
      "higher authority than the king himself—the lex facit regem of\n",
      "the English lawyer Bracton—and in the conception of a\n",
      "fundamental law superior to the will of kings or legislatures, which has\n",
      "played so great a part in recent times.\n",
      "5. Finally, the Stoic conception of duty found congenial soil in\n",
      "the Roman morale. Duty was, indeed, the inner correlate of a\n",
      "social and political system that made law and government\n",
      "supreme. As rational, Cicero held, man ought to recognize the law\n",
      "of reason. As human, he is endowed by nature with a sense of\n",
      "order, decency, and propriety; he should therefore conform to\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the law of nature and respond to the intrinsic worth of what is\n",
      "honorable—honestum, the nearest Roman equivalent of the\n",

      "When the Roman Empire of the West yielded to the\n",
      "assaults of the barbarians, Christianity had already been for a\n",
      "century and a half the official religion. The bishops of Rome had\n",
      "already claimed a primacy, and St. Augustine in his Civitas Dei\n",
      "had presented the City of God as superior to the earthly realm\n",
      "which was crumbling from inner disintegration and outer\n",
      "attacks. For a thousand years the church asserted and maintained\n",
      "increasing sway over Europe. The Bishop of Rome had come to\n",
      "be recognized as the Vicar of Christ. As God was Creator and\n",
      "Ruler, whose will was law, and whose being was perfect\n",
      "goodness, so his representative was entitled to the obedience of all\n",
      "people. It was not the rule of a cruel or unreasonable sovereign—\n",
      "God was love as well as justice. His grace provided salvation for\n",
      "men. The church with its sacraments was the institution through\n",
      "which this grace came. It brought the newly born into its care,\n",
      "consecrated his marriage, reproved his faults, absolved his sins,\n",
      "gave comfort in the hour of death and promised a future of\n",
      "blessedness to the faithful. The church included all men—not\n",
      "merely the saints. Some, like beginners in a school, were\n",
      "regarded as less advanced than others, but all were conceived to be\n",
      "within its care. So the church claimed to be universal not only in\n",
      "its rule over all but in its inclusion of all within its ministrations.\n",
      "It symbolized the unity of mankind, as all men were the creatures\n",
      "and rightful subjects of God.\n",
      "There was a graded succession in the clergy through whom the\n",
      "divine grace descended. From pope to bishop, and bishop to\n",
      "priest who administered the sacraments. In a similar way the\n",
      "member owed obedience to the priest and priest to bishop, and\n",
      "bishop to pope, and pope to God.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "The church attempted and to a considerable degree exercised a\n",
      "restraining power over the two great spheres of politics and\n",
      "economics which later claimed independence of at least the then\n",
      "prevalent moral standards. The family, on the other hand, felt\n",
      "the support of the religious community so desirable that even\n",
      "in Protestant countries marriages continued largely to be\n",
      "performed by the clergy who for this purpose served as officers of\n",
      "the civil government.\n",
      "In the field of government the church had to oppose the\n",
      "turbulent tribal chiefs and feudal lords who not only had frequent\n",
      "occasions for quarrels in the absence of recognized authority, but\n",
      "also considered arms the only manly profession and prized\n",
      "military glory as the highest honor. Against such frequent truculence\n",
      "and almost continuous wars the church inherited on the one\n",
      "hand the spirit of the prophet and of Jesus which called for\n",
      "peace. It inherited also the ideal of a beloved community in\n",
      "which the love of the Master for his followers should be imitated\n",
      "in the love of each for the brethren. It enacted in various councils\n",
      "decrees for a \"peace of God\" which, if not forbidding war\n",
      "entirely, aimed to limit its cruelties and burdens by forbidding\n",
      "under pain of excommunication every act of private warfare or\n",
      "violence against ecclesiastical buildings and against clerics,\n",
      "pilgrims, merchants, women, and peasants. The truce of God\n",
      "(treuga Dei), at first prohibited every act of private warfare from\n",
      "Saturday noon until Monday morning; by the middle of the\n",
      "eleventh century it extended from Wednesday evening to Monday\n",
      "morning, and also in most places included Lent and Advent. It\n",
      "spread through France, Italy, and the Empire. When it reached\n",
      "its limits three quarters of the days of the year were covered by it.\n",
      "The Crusades showed the conflicts between the unifying purpose\n",
      "under which the kings were marshaled and the jealousies which\n",
      "rendered the expeditions futile.\n",
      "In the economic field the church aimed to govern the excessive\n",
      "greed of gain. In particular it condemned usury. At that time men\n",
      "did not ordinarily borrow money in order to invest it in\n",
      "profitable enterprise. The borrower was usually a man caught in some\n",
      "misfortune. To take advantage of his necessity was not fair.\n",
      "Prices in trade were to be \"just,\" and reasonable. Every product\n",
      "was held to have intrinsic value, so that it was not considered\n",
      "ethical to make money by exchanges of goods, by buying cheap\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "and selling dear. Consumption ought to be measured by the\n",
      "natural end of maintaining life and by a regard for the needs of\n",
      "others. Wealth according to the parable of the rich man was a\n",
      "danger to the soul. Private property according to the Fathers of\n",
      "the early Christian centuries was not according to God's original\n",
      "plan. It was the will of God, said St. Ambrose, that the earth\n",
      "should be the common possession of all men, and should furnish\n",
      "its fruits to all; it was avarice which created the rights of\n",
      "property. Gratian, the compiler of the Canon Law in the twelfth\n",
      "century, draws on the Stoic-Roman conception of the law of nature\n",
      "for a similar view. By the law of nature all things are common to\n",
      "all men—it is only by the law of custom or of positive law that\n",
      "this is mine and that is another's—almsgiving to those in need\n",
      "was then consistently held to be an act of justice, not of mercy.\n",
      "St. Thomas, indeed, distinguishes property, as a right to acquire\n",
      "and distribute, from the right to use for oneself. The first is\n",
      "legitimate and necessary; the second not, for a man must hold his\n",
      "goods for common use.\n",
      "It added to the prestige of the clergy that they were the learned\n",
      "class. They could read and write. They were the custodians of\n",
      "what survived of the culture of Greece and Rome as well as\n",
      "of the sacred books of the Christian religion.\n",
      "To enforce its decrees and decisions the church relied\n",
      "principally on the respect and awe which it received in the Ages of\n",
      "Faith as being God's representative. For lesser offenses it\n",
      "employed confession, admonition, and penance; for the bolder and\n",
      "graver sins, excommunication, which none would lightly incur.\n",
      "But the significant thing was that the moral life was clearly\n",
      "defined by the guidance of the church—the moral law was the law\n",
      "of God.\n",
      "§ 2. The Renaissance and Reformation to the Revolutions\n",
      "This period saw the rise of nationalism and of civil and\n",
      "religious liberty, the growth of a middle class and of capitalism,\n",
      "the discovery of the New World and the settlement of it, the\n",
      "birth of modern science, the flowering of the arts of painting,\n",

      "warrior kings into national States. England, France, Spain led;\n",
      "Germany and Italy did not achieve this status until the nineteenth\n",
      "century. Some of the present moral values and evils of\n",
      "nationalism will be discussed in Part III. Here we need only point out\n",
      "that the formation of national States tended to strengthen the\n",
      "sovereignty of such governments in opposition to the unity of\n",
      "Europe for which church and pope had stood. It was a breaking\n",
      "away from the rule of Rome. The act of Henry VIII in\n",
      "proclaiming himself Head of the English Church was a dramatic\n",
      "expression. It tended to substitute patriotism for religion as supreme\n",
      "authority. But perhaps the most significant influence for morality\n",
      "was the consequence drawn by Machiavelli and by rulers of\n",
      "States, that politics is politics—not morals. Machiavelli\n",
      "conceived the deliverance of Italy from foreign power to be so\n",
      "important that a prince who had this aim would be justified in any\n",
      "policies or measures necessary in order to gain and keep power.\n",
      "This had been a working theory with many who had not so\n",
      "frankly avowed it as did Machiavelli. In the United States it is\n",
      "still frequently accepted as a principle in the practices of political\n",
      "parties. In Europe it has been used in justification of wars.\n",
      "2. A middle class—merchants, yeomen, craftsmen—emerged,\n",
      "which led in a struggle for civil and political liberty. In the Middle\n",
      "Ages men from various orders of society might enter the clergy\n",
      "and rise to high position in the church. But the great mass of the\n",
      "population were of the two classes, landholders and serfs, or\n",
      "villeins. In England at the time of Domesday Book—a census\n",
      "made for William the Conqueror in 1086—Gentry and Clergy\n",
      "numbered 9,300; Freeholders and Yeomen, 35,000; Half-free or\n",
      "Unfree, Villeins, Cottars, and Bordars, 259,000; Slaves 25,000.\n",
      "The proportion of free to unfree was then about one to six, and\n",
      "the six had few rights against the one. In the early English law\n",
      "107 paragraphs have been counted which were dictated by the\n",
      "purpose of distinguishing between classes. But in the fourteenth\n",
      "and fifteenth centuries the shift from the old method of service in\n",
      "exchange for the use of land to money payments of wages,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "together with the Black Death in the middle of the fourteenth\n",
      "century, and numerous other changes, broke down the feudal\n",
      "system of land tenure and the villeins became free. The growth of\n",
      "free cities was a parallel development which marked the increase\n",
      "and growing power of merchants and craftsmen. The new trade\n",
      "routes opened by the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English\n",
      "navigators added to the prosperity of the cities which were\n",
      "seaports. Freemen were entitled to rights, and wealth was a\n",
      "powerful support to their claims. Yeomen and London were the main\n",
      "supports of the Parliamentary cause in the struggle with the\n",
      "Stuarts; the country districts generally supported the King.\n",
      "Meanwhile out of the older local and tribal customs the king's\n",
      "judges in England were gradually building a \"common law\" of\n",
      "the realm, which at first was no doubt based on the distinction in\n",
      "class which we have noted, but which, largely because it was\n",
      "\"common,\" came to be more uniform, not only for all parts of\n",
      "the realm, but for all persons, and to be regarded as an agent\n",
      "of protection, even against the arbitrary acts of the king himself.\n",
      "By the seventeenth century civil rights had been so recognized\n",
      "and defined that even the overthrow and execution of a king\n",
      "could be regarded as a legal procedure made necessary to\n",
      "maintain the liberties of the people of England.\n",
      "Milton and Locke were eloquent defenders of liberty. They\n",
      "drew on both the old Stoic-Roman conception of natural law\n",
      "and the Christian conception of God-given law. But to use these\n",
      "conceptions in defense of liberty, men of the seventeenth and\n",
      "eighteenth centuries shifted the emphasis from law to rights. The\n",
      "doctrine of natural rights became a symbol of the growing\n",
      "strength of the individual, asserting itself as over against the\n",
      "formerly claimed divine right of monarchs.\n",
      "\"All men naturally were born free,\" wrote Milton. \"To\n",
      "understand political power right,\" wrote Locke, \"and derive it from\n",
      "the original, we must consider what state all men are naturally\n",
      "in, and that is a state of perfect freedom to order their actions\n",
      "and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit\n",
      "within the bounds of the law of nature; without asking leave or\n",
      "depending upon the will of any other man. A state also of\n",
      "equality, wherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal.\" These\n",
      "doctrines of natural liberty and natural rights found eloquent\n",
      "portrayal in Rousseau; they challenged the old order in the bold\n",

      "                            \n",
      "declarations of American independence in 1776, and of the\n",
      "French Revolution in 1789. For they declared that governments\n",
      "were established to secure these rights, and derived their just\n",
      "powers from the consent of the governed.\n",
      "The effect of such assertion of rights upon the moral\n",
      "consciousness was obviously to make it less willing to accept any\n",
      "authority in morals that could not justify itself to reason and\n",
      "conscience.\n",
      "3. The great religious event of the period was the\n",
      "Reformation. Instead of the unity of Christendom which the\n",
      "medieval church had sought, fierce contests became general between\n",
      "princes, vigorous arguments between divines. Besides the\n",
      "reforms of the church which Luther and Calvin urged, another\n",
      "theory of Christianity and Christian community came forward.\n",
      "Even from the beginning there were two interpretations of the\n",
      "spirit of Christianity. The Catholic church conceived itself as the\n",
      "agency of divine grace and salvation for a sinful world. Its\n",
      "sacraments were the channels of this grace. It aimed to include all\n",
      "from birth to death in care, instruction, reproof, and remission.\n",
      "On the other hand some believers had cherished the more\n",
      "personal and individual aspects of the Founder's life and teaching.\n",
      "The Sermon on the Mount seemed to lend little support for\n",
      "imposing hierarchy and temporal power. Instead of a universal\n",
      "church, including all, these believers held that the church should\n",
      "consist of those only who had been converted, and were\n",
      "sincerely seeking to follow the Master. The beloved community was\n",
      "for them to include those who loved the Master and each other.\n",
      "They would keep aloof from the World, not in the ascetic temper\n",
      "of the monk, not to mortify the flesh, but to pursue a radically\n",
      "different type of life from that dominated by ambition, wealth,\n",
      "or lust. They regarded the sacrament of the Eucharist as a\n",
      "commemoration by the faithful instead of as a sacrifice reenacted in\n",
      "the Mass. In the medieval period the Waldenses had declared for\n",
      "such a conception of a voluntary community of believers; the\n",
      "Franciscans aimed in the spirit of Matthew, ch. 10, to imitate\n",
      "Christ, in poverty and ministry to the poor, although they\n",
      "remained within the Catholic church. In the fourteenth century\n",
      "Wycliffe (1320-84) had sent out \"poor\" or \"simple\" priests to\n",
      "preach to the common people, and with his followers had\n",
      "translated the Bible into English. He attacked the right of the clergy to\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "hold property, and opposed to the political conception of the\n",
      "church organization the simpler pattern set by Christ, and the\n",
      "first disciples. He not only appealed to the authority of the\n",
      "Scripture as superior to that of the church but by his translation\n",
      "appealed also to the common man to test his position. John Huss\n",
      "of Bohemia held similar doctrines. The Lollards continued the\n",
      "Wycliffe tradition. Mennonites, Baptists, the Scrooby group of\n",
      "Separatists who crossed to Holland, and later to Plymouth,\n",
      "Massachusetts, as \"Pilgrims,\" all held to the view of the church as a\n",
      "company of believers. The Friends or Quakers appealed to an\n",
      "inner light as authority. In all these groups, even more decisively\n",
      "than in the Reforming groups of Lutherans, Calvinists, and\n",
      "Puritans within the church of England, the rejection of the rule of\n",
      "the church forced an effort to justify this rejection. At first the\n",
      "authority of the Scriptures was often the court of appeal. The\n",
      "invention of printing was of great importance in making the\n",
      "individual the interpreter of the Scriptures. The emphasis upon the\n",
      "individual's own belief and his voluntary choice of membership\n",
      "in the Christian community made for moral reflection and\n",
      "individual responsibility.\n",
      "All these dissenting groups sought liberty for themselves—for\n",
      "what they regarded as the true teaching. Few conceived of\n",
      "toleration or regarded religious liberty as permissible. The Baptists\n",
      "were pioneers in religious liberty; in England, John Locke's\n",
      "powerful Essay (1667) and four Letters on Toleration were\n",
      "among the strongest influences in its advance. Thomas Jefferson\n",
      "linked his own service in this field with that in the cause of civil\n",
      "and political liberty, and in education, in the epitaph which he\n",
      "selected: \"Author of the American Declaration of Independence,\n",
      "of the statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and father of the\n",
      "University of Virginia.\"\n",
      "4. The economic development in this period saw the change\n",
      "from the feudal system of service to the system of money\n",
      "payment. This was a step toward greater economic liberty. The\n",
      "discoveries of new trade routes to the Far East, and of the New\n",
      "World, tended to increase the wealth of merchants and to some\n",
      "extent of other classes. When men gained wealth, they gained\n",
      "power. The palaces and dwellings of Venice, of the old Flemish\n",
      "ports, and of many another European city show the early\n",
      "manifestations of this new power. They show also the new interests in\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "making fine and beautiful the abodes of secular life, whereas\n",
      "in the Middle Ages the skill of craftsmen as well as the resources\n",
      "of the people had gone into cathedrals that so well represent\n",
      "what was most prized when Chartres, Rheims, Canterbury, and\n",
      "Lincoln were building.\n",
      "Along with the growth of commerce and industry came a new\n",
      "theory as to the place of trade in national life, and as to the\n",
      "method of regulating economic affairs. A policy of economic\n",
      "liberty gradually took shape, which was the natural analogue of\n",
      "civil and religious liberty. In the Middle Ages, trade was\n",
      "controlled. Certain customs and standards which were at first not\n",
      "included within the common law, were administered by courts of\n",
      "merchants. Gilds were in some cases responsible for honest\n",
      "dealing. The very word \"honesty,\" which in Rome meant rather what\n",
      "was honorable, came to refer particularly to the maintenance of\n",
      "good faith and fair dealing in trade or financial transactions.\n",
      "Society attempted to set a moral standard and to control business\n",
      "and industry by it. It aimed to find out by some means what was\n",
      "a reasonable price. In the case of manufactured goods, this could\n",
      "be sometimes fixed by the opinion of fellow craftsmen. Where\n",
      "buyers and sellers met and bargained in an open market, a\n",
      "\"common estimation\" could be trusted to give a fair value. A maximum\n",
      "limit, however, was set for victuals in towns. Or again, custom\n",
      "prescribed what should be the money equivalent for payments\n",
      "formerly made in kind or in personal service. One type of\n",
      "regulation has survived to the present day in the form of usury laws.\n",
      "The distinctive feature of modern economic life has been the\n",
      "tendency to abandon all restriction imposed by an outside moral\n",
      "standard, and to substitute a system of free bargaining, free\n",
      "contract. This is one aspect of the complex system called capitalism,\n",
      "although the full development of capitalism was not reached in\n",
      "this period.\n",
      "To prevent extortionate prices on the one hand, or unduly low\n",
      "prices on the other, the reliance of capitalism has been on\n",
      "competition and the general principle of supply and demand. If a\n",
      "baker charges too high for his bread, others will set up shops and\n",
      "sell cheaper. If a money lender asks too high interest, men will\n",
      "not borrow or will find a loan elsewhere. If a wage is too low,\n",
      "labor will go elsewhere; if too high, capital will not be able to\n",
      "find a profit and so will not employ labor—so runs the theory.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Without analyzing the moral value of the theory at this point, we\n",
      "notice that, in so far as it assumes to secure fair bargains and a\n",
      "just distribution, it assumes the parties to the free contract to be\n",
      "really free. This implies that they are upon nearly equal footing.\n",
      "In the days of hand work and small industries, that is, until the\n",
      "industrial revolution, this was a plausible assumption.\n",
      "This theory of free bargaining fitted in well with the doctrine\n",
      "of natural rights which flourished in the eighteenth century. It is\n",
      "an interesting coincidence that Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations\n",
      "which advocated freedom from various restrictions of former\n",
      "times in commerce and industry appeared in the same year with\n",
      "the American Declaration of Independence, in 1776. Adam Smith\n",
      "went further: he held that although the rich man might be\n",
      "seeking only his own gain with no thought of public benefit, he\n",
      "would be led \"as if by an invisible hand to contribute to the\n",
      "general good.\" If this was true, why worry over the morality of the\n",
      "selfish pursuit of gain? This of course did not mean that there\n",
      "were no moral principles observed in business. On the contrary,\n",
      "business worked out certain rules which were absolutely\n",
      "essential to maintenance of business relations, such as the payment of\n",
      "debts, the observance of all contracts, and of good faith in\n",
      "certain respects at least. But the full force of the moral problems of\n",
      "capitalism did not develop until after the industrial revolution.\n",
      "So far as industry was concerned, this rise of a new middle\n",
      "class, made up of those who were in part workers with their\n",
      "hands, resulted in a changed attitude toward manual labor. The\n",
      "class ideal of the warrior and his descendant, the gentleman, was\n",
      "distinctly opposed to manual labor. \"Arms,\" or the Court, or the\n",
      "Church, was the proper profession; hunting, or fishing, or sport,\n",
      "was the appropriate recreation. This view was more or less bound\n",
      "up with the fact that in primitive conditions, labor was mainly\n",
      "performed by women or by slaves. It was the business, the\n",
      "\"virtue\" of men to fight, or govern. Ancient culture strengthened this\n",
      "prejudice. The church, on the other hand, had maintained both\n",
      "the dignity and the moral value of labor. Not only the example\n",
      "of the Founder of Christianity and his early disciples, who were\n",
      "for the most part of the humbler classes of society, but the\n",
      "intrinsic moral value of work entered into appraisal. The Puritans\n",
      "especially, who had a wide-reaching influence upon the northern\n",
      "and western portions of America, were insistent upon industry,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "not merely for the sake of its products—they were frugal in their\n",
      "consumption—but as expressing a type of character. Idleness\n",
      "and \"shiftlessness\" were not merely ineffective, they were sinful.\n",
      "\"If any will not work, neither let him eat,\" commended itself\n",
      "thoroughly to this class ideal. Further as good Calvinists who\n",
      "believed in the doctrine of divine election, the Puritans laid stress\n",
      "upon the idea that every man—not the clergy only—had a\n",
      "\"calling,\" a part to perform, in God's plan of the work of the world.\n",
      "That the laborer brought something to the common weal,\n",
      "while the idler had to be supported was a further reenforcement.\n",
      "As the middle and lower classes became increasingly influential,\n",
      "the very fact that they were themselves laborers and traders\n",
      "added a class motive. It was natural that a laboring class should\n",
      "regard labor as \"honest\" (i.e., honorable), though at an earlier\n",
      "time such a collocation of terms as \"honest labor\" would have\n",
      "sounded as absurd as \"honest villain\" (villein). A further\n",
      "influence effective in America was the fluidity of class distinctions in\n",
      "a new country. The man who was honored on the frontier was\n",
      "the man who could shoot straight, fell his trees, and subdue the\n",
      "soil. The influence of the frontier was largely on the side of\n",
      "the value of work, and the reprobation of idleness.\n",
      "5. The Renaissance saw the dawn of modern science; the\n",
      "eighteenth century witnessed a further emancipation of thought. It\n",
      "would be giving a wrong impression to imply that there was no\n",
      "inquiry, no use of reason in the medieval world. The problems\n",
      "set by the inheritance of Old-World religion and politics, forced\n",
      "themselves upon the builders of castles and cathedrals, of law\n",
      "and of dogma. The universities were centres of discussion in\n",
      "which brilliant minds often challenged received opinions. Men\n",
      "like Roger Bacon sought to discover nature's secrets, and the\n",
      "great scholastics mastered Greek philosophy in the interest of\n",
      "defending the faith. But theological interest limited freedom and\n",
      "choice of theme. It was not until the expansion of the\n",
      "individual—in political freedom, in the use of the arts, in the\n",
      "development of commerce—that the purely intellectual interest such as\n",
      "had once characterized Greece awoke. A new world of\n",
      "possibilities seemed dawning upon the Italian, Galileo, the Frenchman,\n",
      "Descartes, the Englishman, Francis Bacon. The instruments of\n",
      "thought had been sharpened by the dialectics of the schools;\n",
      "now let them be used to analyze the world in which we live.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Instead of merely observing nature Galileo applied the\n",
      "experimental method, putting definite questions to nature and thus\n",
      "preparing the way for a progress step by step toward a positive\n",
      "knowledge of nature's laws. Descartes found in mathematics a\n",
      "method of analysis which had never been appreciated before.\n",
      "What seemed the mysterious path of bodies in curved lines could\n",
      "be given a simple statement in his analytic geometry. Leibniz\n",
      "and Newton carried this method to triumphant results in the\n",
      "analysis of forces. Reason appeared able to discover and frame\n",
      "the laws of the universe—the \"principles\" of nature. Bacon,\n",
      "with less of positive contribution in method, sounded another\n",
      "note which was equally significant. The human mind is liable to\n",
      "be clouded and hindered in its activities by certain inveterate\n",
      "sources of error. Like deceitful images or obsessions the \"idols\"\n",
      "of the tribe, of the cave, of the market, and of the theater—due\n",
      "to instinct or habit, to language or tradition—prevent the reason\n",
      "from doing its best work. It needs vigorous effort to free the\n",
      "mind from these idols. But this can be done. Let man turn from\n",
      "metaphysics and theology to nature and life; let him follow\n",
      "reason instead of instinct or prejudice. \"Knowledge is power.\"\n",
      "Through it may rise above the kingdom of nature the \"kingdom\n",
      "of man.\" In his New Atlantis, Bacon foresees a human society in\n",
      "which skill and invention and government shall all contribute to\n",
      "human welfare. These three notes, the experimental method, the\n",
      "power of rational analysis through mathematics, and the\n",
      "possibility of controlling nature in the interests of man, were\n",
      "characteristic of the period.\n",
      "A conflict of reason with authority went on side by side with\n",
      "the progress of science. Humanists and scientists had often set\n",
      "themselves against dogma and tradition. The Reformation was\n",
      "not in form an appeal to reason, but the clash of authorities\n",
      "stimulated men to reasoning upon the respective claims of\n",
      "Catholic and Protestant. And in the eighteenth century, under the\n",
      "favoring influence of a broad toleration and a general growth of\n",
      "intelligence, the conflict of reason with dogma reached its\n",
      "culmination. The French call the period l'Illumination—the\n",
      "illumination of life and experience by the light of reason. The Germans\n",
      "call it the Aufklärung, \"the clearing-up.\" What was to be cleared\n",
      "up? First, ignorance, which limits the range of man's power and\n",
      "infects him with fear of the unknown; then superstition, which is\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "ignorance consecrated by wont and emotion; finally, dogma,\n",
      "which usually embodies irrational elements and seeks to force\n",
      "them upon the mind by the power of authority, not of truth. Nor\n",
      "was it merely a question of intellectual criticism. Voltaire saw that\n",
      "dogma was often responsible for cruelty. Ignorance meant belief\n",
      "in witchcraft and magic. From the dawn of civilization this had\n",
      "beset man's progress and quenched many of the brightest geniuses\n",
      "of the past. It was time to put an end once for all to the\n",
      "remnants of primitive credulity; it was time to be guided by the light\n",
      "of reason. The movement was not all negative. Using the same\n",
      "appeal to \"nature,\" which had served so well as a rallying cry in\n",
      "the development of political rights, the protagonists of the\n",
      "movement spoke of a \"natural light\" which God had placed in man\n",
      "for his guidance—\"the candle of the Lord set up by himself in\n",
      "men's minds, which it is impossible for the breath or power\n",
      "of man wholly to extinguish.\" A natural and rational religion\n",
      "should take the place of supposed revelation.\n",
      "But the great achievement of the eighteenth century in the\n",
      "intellectual development of the individual was that the human mind\n",
      "came to realize the part it was itself playing in the whole realm of\n",
      "science and conduct. Man began to look within. Whether he\n",
      "called his work an Essay concerning Human Understanding, or\n",
      "a Treatise of Human Nature, or a Theory of Moral Sentiments,\n",
      "or a Critique of Pure Reason, the aim was to study human\n",
      "experience. For of a sudden it was dawning upon man that, if he was\n",
      "then living upon a higher level of knowledge and conduct than\n",
      "the animal or the savage, this must be due to the activity of the\n",
      "mind. It appeared that man, not satisfied with \"nature,\" had\n",
      "gone on to build a new world with institutions and morality,\n",
      "with art and science. This was no creation of instinct or habit;\n",
      "nor could it be explained in terms of sense, or feeling, or impulse\n",
      "alone; it was the work of that more active, universal, and\n",
      "creative type of intelligence which we call reason. Man, as capable of\n",
      "such achievements in science and conduct, must be regarded\n",
      "with new respect. As having political rights, freedom, and\n",
      "responsibility, man has the dignity of a citizen, sovereign as well as\n",
      "subject. As guiding and controlling his own life and that of\n",
      "others by the power of ideas, not of force, he has the dignity of a\n",
      "moral person, a moral sovereignty. He does not merely take what\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "nature brings; he sets up ends of his own and gives them worth.\n",
      "In this, Kant saw the supreme dignity of the human spirit.\n",
      "6. Art and letters revealed and ministered to growing\n",
      "individuality. The Middle Ages found appropriate expression for its spirit\n",
      "in the cathedrals erected to the service of God, in which the\n",
      "community came together to bow before a supreme authority, and to\n",
      "feel their common membership in the City of God. The modern\n",
      "world, if it has found no art so expressive of reverence and\n",
      "community, has developed many arts that have disclosed the\n",
      "aspirations, the wide-ranging interests, the delight in adventure, the\n",
      "urgent passions, and the broadening sympathies of modern life.\n",
      "The Crusades, contact, through them and later through\n",
      "commerce, with Arabian civilization, growing acquaintance with the\n",
      "literature and art of Greece and Rome, were effective agencies in\n",
      "the beginnings. The Renaissance, or rebirth of interest and joy\n",
      "in the secular life, showed itself in Italy in painting, sculpture,\n",
      "and romance; in England, in the drama of Shakspere. These were\n",
      "followed by the painting of the Low Countries and of Spain, the\n",
      "drama of France, the music of Germany. And finally fiction, a\n",
      "form of art peculiarly adapted to the portrayal of individual\n",
      "character spread through the whole modern world.\n",
      "This rich development of artistic and literary expression\n",
      "claimed independence from such moral control of subject and\n",
      "treatment as was characteristic of the Middle Ages. The\n",
      "Renaissance led with its portraiture of powerful personalities. The\n",
      "Restoration drama reacted against Puritanism. The Storm and Stress\n",
      "movement revolted not only against literary tradition, but also\n",
      "against institutions and customs which were felt to be\n",
      "constraints of the individual.\n",
      "One other influence of art and letters was of a more positive\n",
      "nature. The increase of humanitarianism during the period had\n",
      "many sources, but art both expressed and contributed to wider\n",
      "sympathies. Art communicates feeling. Drama and fiction take\n",
      "us into the lives of other people. During the Renaissance it was\n",
      "largely the upper class that provided most of the heroes and\n",
      "heroines, but as time went on the middle class also claimed\n",
      "attention. A Rembrandt found lines of character in an old man or\n",
      "woman, and the portrait did not suggest any query as to whether\n",
      "the subject were prince or peasant. Velasquez painted kings and\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "topers with the same merciless and unflinching search for\n",
      "character. Burns, the farmer, looked forward to a day\n",
      "When man to man the warld o'er\n",
      "Shall brithers be for a' that.\n",
      "§ 3. Since the Revolutions\n",
      "1. The American and French Revolutions marked a\n",
      "crisis in government; the industrial revolution brought about an\n",
      "even more far-reaching change in the life of the average man in\n",
      "Europe and America. The American and French Revolutions\n",
      "carried one step farther a movement in the interest of liberty\n",
      "which had its beginnings in the freeing of villeins and rise of a\n",
      "middle class. The English had already achieved Parliamentary\n",
      "government in their civil war and in 1688. They took a further\n",
      "step in 1832 in their reform of abuses and extension of the\n",
      "franchise. What made the American Revolution more striking was\n",
      "its clear declaration of liberty and its result in the formation\n",
      "of a new nation. The French Revolution was more spectacular\n",
      "than the American because of its more radical character. It\n",
      "affected the ideas of Europeans more profoundly, because for one\n",
      "reason it was nearer home. It was echoed in the literature of the\n",
      "time. The American and French Revolutions both emphasized\n",
      "democracy not only in its aspect of liberty and self-government,\n",
      "but in its other meaning of equality. They contributed powerfully\n",
      "to level the distinctions fixed by birth between classes. The\n",
      "American nation was in Lincoln's words, \"conceived in liberty and\n",
      "dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" The\n",
      "French made Liberty, Equality, Fraternity their motto.\n",
      "In continuation of these Revolutions, Democracy in both\n",
      "aspects has become the generally accepted theory of government\n",
      "and in a great degree a standard of social life. James, Viscount\n",
      "Bryce, in his Modern Democracies published in 1921,\n",
      "commented on the change which had taken place in the past century.\n",
      "One hundred years before there was in the Old World one tiny\n",
      "spot (some of the Swiss cantons) under democratic government.\n",
      "By 1921 there were \"more than one hundred representative\n",
      "assemblies at work all over the earth legislating for self-governing\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "communities.\" Not only so but in the United States, Canada, and\n",
      "Northern Europe, women have been admitted to the franchise.\n",
      "Not less significant, in Lord Bryce's opinion is the change of\n",
      "general attitude. \"Seventy years ago—the word Democracy\n",
      "awakened dislike or fear. Now it is a word of praise.\" The spread\n",
      "of self-government and of equality has had a fundamental\n",
      "influence upon morals, as regards the general attitude toward\n",
      "authority. When people make their own laws they do not readily\n",
      "accept any moral standard or law which rests on authority of a\n",
      "ruling class, or of elders, or of church, or of school—unless it\n",
      "can justify itself by some other test.\n",
      "In the train of political democracy has followed enlarged\n",
      "educational opportunity. This has appealed to general sentiment\n",
      "both as a necessity for intelligent voting and as a right of every\n",
      "child to share in at least the rudiments of the general inheritance.\n",
      "Education makes possible the reading of news and the\n",
      "participation in discussion. It is another influence making for reflective\n",
      "morality.\n",
      "The growth of political democracy and the widening of\n",
      "educational opportunity have made for a deepening and\n",
      "broadening of moral consciousness. Another political development has\n",
      "added rather to its perplexities. The power of nationalism has\n",
      "increased. Cultural tradition, economic advantage, pride in\n",
      "national strength, fear of other nations, military armaments on a\n",
      "vast scale, constant pressure from military personnel, imperial\n",
      "expansion of the great powers—all have contributed to a war\n",
      "spirit which culminated in the Great War, and still threatens the\n",
      "peace of the world and the existence of civilization. No issue of\n",
      "our time has evoked such bitter conflicts of moral judgments.\n",
      "Some aspects of these will be considered in Part III.\n",
      "2. Unlike the American and French Revolutions, the industrial\n",
      "revolution cannot be assigned to exact years. It began with the\n",
      "introduction on a large scale of machinery driven by water or\n",
      "steam power. It is still going on in new devices for mass\n",
      "production. It has been accompanied by enormous activity in invention,\n",
      "and in the discovery and use of new forces of nature. It has had\n",
      "as a counterpart the organization of corporate ownership and\n",
      "control of industry. It has been aided in its command of vast\n",
      "resources in money and credit by the expansion of banking and\n",
      "other financial agencies. It has shifted the mass of population\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "from country to city. It has divested the family and home of\n",
      "many of their former functions. It has changed America from a\n",
      "nation of independent farmers and craftsmen to a nation\n",
      "composed in large measure of men and women working for\n",
      "employers. It has produced enormous wealth. In America it has made\n",
      "possible the rapid exploitation of natural resources, and the\n",
      "administration of such a widespread area under a single Federal\n",
      "government.\n",
      "By improved methods of communication and transportation it\n",
      "is breaking down barriers of language, tradition, and political\n",
      "isolation between peoples, and bringing back in another form\n",
      "something of the unity which the medieval church sought. It has\n",
      "made possible the political unification of the widely distant parts\n",
      "of the United States which today read the same news in the\n",
      "morning newspaper or hear it over the radio. It has contributed to\n",
      "the progress of democracy in government, while it has brought\n",
      "back autocracy in industry. It has brought about a shift in men's\n",
      "scale of values and a shift in the relative power and prestige of\n",
      "institutions. In the Middle Ages, the church and the glory of\n",
      "God; in the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, national power\n",
      "and the liberty of the individual; since the Revolutions,\n",
      "democracy and wealth, have been the notes which have stirred men's\n",
      "hearts and enlisted their devotion.\n",
      "Space admits of but the bare mention of three outstanding\n",
      "effects of the industrial revolution which set moral problems for\n",
      "present and future, viz., the new alignment of classes, the\n",
      "autocratic or oligarchic organization of the economic system, and the\n",
      "unequal distribution of the vast wealth produced. More subtle\n",
      "and perhaps more fundamental than any of these have been the\n",
      "changes in valuation of goods, in the meaning of a good life, of\n",
      "success and excellence, which the direction of our energies\n",
      "toward the hitherto unexpected resources of nature has brought\n",
      "about. These problems will be considered in Part III.\n",
      "3. The third principal aspect of the period which has affected\n",
      "morals and its problems is the progress of natural and social\n",
      "science. Chemistry, biology, anthropology, sociology, have come\n",
      "into being. Physics, psychology, physiology, medicine,\n",
      "economics, political science have developed new methods. Applications\n",
      "of the physical sciences have increased comforts and luxuries\n",
      "and made them more generally available. Production of all kinds\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "of goods has vastly increased and this has raised questions of just\n",
      "distribution. But a more direct influence of science upon morals\n",
      "has come from the general spirit and method of scientific\n",
      "inquiry, and in particular from the doctrine of evolution as\n",
      "presented by Darwin and Spencer, and since employed as a method\n",
      "in many fields. For the general spirit of inquiry has led to\n",
      "questioning of many dogmas; the experimental method has not only\n",
      "led to widening of knowledge but in its combination of\n",
      "reasoning and observation—of putting questions to nature—it has set\n",
      "up a test of truth which has wide application; the conception of\n",
      "evolution places the morals of any given time or people in a\n",
      "perspective which renders them less absolute, while it compares\n",
      "them with those of other times and other peoples.\n",
      "§ 4. Sources of Present-Day Moral Conceptions\n",
      "Our conceptions for the moral fact are nearly all taken\n",
      "from the group relations or from the jural and religious aspects,\n",
      "as these have been gradually brought to clearer consciousness.\n",
      "As already noted, the Greek term \"ethical,\" the Latin \"moral,\"\n",
      "the German sittlich, suggest this—ethos meant the \"sum of the\n",
      "characteristic usages, ideas, standards, and codes by which a\n",
      "group was differentiated and individualized in character from\n",
      "other groups.\" Sumner, Folkways, p. 36.\n",
      "1\n",
      "Some specific moral terms come directly from group relations.\n",
      "The \"kind\" man acts as one of the kin. When the ruling or\n",
      "privileged group is contrasted with the man of no family or of inferior\n",
      "birth, we get a large number of terms implying \"superiority\" or\n",
      "\"inferiority\" in birth, and so of general value. This may or may\n",
      "not be due to some inherent superiority of the upper class, but it\n",
      "means at least that the upper class has been most effectual in\n",
      "shaping language and standards of approval. So \"noble\" and\n",
      "\"gentle\" referred to birth before they had moral value; \"duty\" in\n",
      "modern usage seems to have been principally what was due to a\n",
      "superior. Many words for moral disapproval are very significant\n",
      "of class feeling. The \"caitiff\" was a captive, and the Italians have\n",
      "their general term for morally bad, \"cattivo,\" from the same\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "idea. The \"villain\" was a feudal tenant, the \"blackguard\" looked\n",
      "after the kettles, the \"rascal\" was one of the common herd, the\n",
      "\"knave\" was the servant, the \"base\" and \"mean\" were opposed\n",
      "to the gentle and noble. \"Lewd\" meant, characteristic of the laity\n",
      "as contrasted with the clergy.\n",
      "Another set of conceptions reflects the old group approvals or\n",
      "combines these with conceptions of birth. We have noted the\n",
      "twofold root of kalokagathia in Greek. \"Honor\" and \"honesty\"\n",
      "were what the group admired, and conversely \"aischros\" and\n",
      "\"turpe\" in Greek and Latin, like the English \"disgraceful\" or\n",
      "\"shameful,\" were what the group condemned. \"Virtue\" was the\n",
      "manly excellence which called out the praise of a warlike time,\n",
      "while one of the Greek terms for morally bad originally meant\n",
      "cowardly, and our \"scoundrel\" has possibly the same origin. The\n",
      "\"bad\" was probably the weak or the womanish. The economic\n",
      "appears in \"merit,\" what I have earned, and likewise in \"duty\"\n",
      "and \"ought,\" what is due or owed—though duty seems to have\n",
      "made itself felt especially, as noted above, toward a superior.\n",
      "Forethought and skill in practical affairs provided the conception\n",
      "of \"wisdom,\" which was highest of the virtues for the Greeks, and\n",
      "as \"prudence\" stood high in medieval systems. The conception\n",
      "of valuing and thus of forming some permanent standard of a\n",
      "better and a worse, is also aided, if not created, by economic\n",
      "exchange. It appears in almost identical terms in Plato and the New\n",
      "Testament in the challenge, \"What shall it profit a man if he gain\n",
      "the whole world and lose his own life?\" Plato's wording is given on p. ^115.\n",
      "2 From the processes of\n",
      "fine or useful arts came probably the conceptions of measure,\n",
      "order, and harmony. A whole mode of considering the moral life is\n",
      "jural. \"Moral law,\" \"authority,\" \"obligation,\" \"responsibility,\"\n",
      "\"justice,\" \"righteousness,\" bring with them the associations of\n",
      "group control and of the more definitely organized government\n",
      "and law. Finally the last named terms bear also a religious\n",
      "imprint, and numerous conceptions of the moral come from that\n",
      "sphere or get their specific flavor from religious usage. The\n",
      "conceptions of the \"soul\" have contributed to the ideal of a good\n",
      "which is permanent, and which is made rather by personal\n",
      "companionship, than by sensuous gratification. \"Purity\" began as a\n",
      "magical and religious idea; it came to symbolize not only\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "freedom from contamination but singleness of purpose. \"Chastity\"\n",
      "lends a religious sacredness to a virtue which had its roots largely\n",
      "in the conception of property. \"Wicked\" is from witch.\n",
      "We have indeed certain conceptions drawn from individual\n",
      "experiences of impulse, or reflection. From the sense recoil from\n",
      "what was disgusting came such conceptions as \"foul,\" and\n",
      "from kindred imagery of what suits eye or muscular sense came\n",
      "\"straightforward,\" \"upright,\" \"steady.\" From the thinking\n",
      "process itself we have \"conscience.\" This word in Greek and Latin\n",
      "was a general term for consciousness and suggests one of the\n",
      "distinctive, perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of the moral.\n",
      "For it implies a \"conscious\" thoughtful attitude, which operates\n",
      "not only in forming purposes, but in measuring and valuing\n",
      "action by the standards it approves. But it is evident that by far the\n",
      "larger part of our ethical terms are derived from social relations\n",
      "in the broad sense.\n",
      "§ 5. Interpretations of Modern Trends by Ethical Systems\n",
      "It is clear that if ethical systems were to interpret the\n",
      "modern development of the individual along these various lines,\n",
      "they must seek some new basis for the authority of the moral life\n",
      "if the moral life were to have any authority, and must do justice\n",
      "on the one hand to the individual's personal interests, and on the\n",
      "other to his increasing contacts with his fellows, and the growing\n",
      "democracy due to the rise of new classes to the level of\n",
      "consideration and democratic regard. Four such systems had appeared\n",
      "previously to the great change in thought brought about by the\n",
      "work of Darwin and the doctrine of evolution in the middle of\n",
      "the last century: the Selfish System, the Moral Sense theory, the\n",
      "Kantian theory, and the theory of Utilitarianism.\n",
      "1. The selfish system so called was the simplest formulation of\n",
      "the early individualism, particularly as it expressed itself in wars\n",
      "for ambition and plunder, or sought protection for private\n",
      "interests under the authority of the State. Its most famous expounder\n",
      "was the Englishman, Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), whose\n",
      "great work the Leviathan or The Matter, Form and Power of a\n",
      "Common-wealth appeared in 1651 just following the Thirty\n",

      "                            \n",
      "Years' War on the continent and the civil war in England which\n",
      "ended with the execution of Charles I. Self-preservation is\n",
      "according to Hobbes the first law of nature; all society is \"for gain\n",
      "or for glory.\" Instead of the natural law of Rome and of Grotius,\n",
      "Hobbes could see only a natural \"right\" of each man to protect\n",
      "himself by any means in his power, and a natural law of\n",
      "prudence. This leads him to combine with others to set up an\n",
      "authority or sovereign that can keep the peace and make it\n",
      "practicable for each man to keep his contracts and abstain from\n",
      "warfare and plots against his fellows. We may regard it from one\n",
      "point of view as an attempt to show that even if we set aside all\n",
      "laws of God and all the standards that tradition has built up, we\n",
      "are nevertheless forced, if we wish to preserve life at all, to find a\n",
      "new basis for morals. If we strip off everything else and come\n",
      "down to the last ultimate fact of self-preservation, we find that\n",
      "we must create a moral system to protect ourselves.\n",
      "2. This selfish system seemed shocking in its naked reduction\n",
      "of human life to the single bare struggle for self-preservation. Is\n",
      "humanity so simple, so egoistic as this? The Moral Sense\n",
      "writers (Shaftesbury, 1671-1713; Hutcheson, 1694-1747; Hume,\n",
      "1711-76; Adam Smith, 1723-90) answered, No. Man has other\n",
      "impulses than merely to preserve himself; he has a \"herding\n",
      "instinct\" which leads him to seek the company of his fellows. He\n",
      "has kindly impulses and affections, and is made happy when he\n",
      "gratifies these in generous activities. And further he is pleased\n",
      "and delights in observing kindly and generous behavior in\n",
      "others. He does not first have to calculate whether a noble and\n",
      "generous deed will benefit him personally; he approves it at once. He\n",
      "sympathizes with the one who is aided; he sympathizes no less\n",
      "with the generous actor. His approval of what is noble and\n",
      "generous and right, and his resentment at what is cruel, injurious,\n",
      "mean, and wrong are thus so direct and immediate that we may\n",
      "properly call their source a \"sense\"—a moral sense. Even if man\n",
      "denies any authority above him, he cannot get rid of his own\n",
      "feelings. The individual is thus moral because he has these moral\n",
      "feelings and sentiments as an ineradicable part of his own nature.\n",
      "3. The Kantian theory took its stand on a different part of\n",
      "human nature, which Kant believed to be as fundamental as the\n",
      "sentiments but more adequate to account for the authority which\n",
      "morality seems to possess. The author of the theory, Immanuel\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Kant, of Königsberg (1724-1804) published his most important\n",
      "ethical writings in 1785 and 1788. He was tremendously\n",
      "impressed by the whole movement toward freedom in political life,\n",
      "in religion, and in the intellectual sphere. At the same time he\n",
      "was as thoroughly convinced of the necessity of order and law.\n",
      "The central fact of morals appeared to him to be the voice of\n",
      "duty, \"I ought.\" How can we do justice to this fact and also to\n",
      "the freedom and independence of the individual? On the one\n",
      "hand, the more we consider the essence of morality the more we\n",
      "see that it presupposes something binding upon all of us, and (as\n",
      "against the selfish system) something that shall bring about\n",
      "harmony in human life. The Moral Sense system is weak on the first\n",
      "demand, for the objector may urge, \"I have no such feelings as\n",
      "you describe and therefore I don't feel any compulsion to be just\n",
      "or generous.\" The selfish system is weak on the second point,\n",
      "because if each man is looking out for himself the result is a selfish\n",
      "scramble and discord rather than harmony. The only agreement\n",
      "reached on this basis is that of the married couple who agreed\n",
      "perfectly in that each wanted his own way. The source of\n",
      "morality and of the law that shall control and harmonize life must be\n",
      "sought not in interest or feelings but (as by the ancient Stoics) in\n",
      "reason. And this gives us a clue to the problem of uniting\n",
      "authority with liberty. For in obeying the law of reason man is not\n",
      "obeying an outside authority; he is obeying a law imposed by\n",
      "himself. Autonomy, i.e., a law which is self-given, is the same as\n",
      "freedom. In this statement, Kant is putting into different terms\n",
      "Rousseau's formulation of the basis of rightful government,\n",
      "namely, a government which men establish by their own will.\n",
      "Finally, Kant gave his finest and most influential interpretation of\n",
      "the essence of morality in the conception that every human being\n",
      "is an end in himself, that he has intrinsic worth—\"So treat\n",
      "humanity whether in thine own person or that of another always as\n",
      "an end, never as means only.\"\n",
      "4. The fourth system, Utilitarianism, like the first two, had\n",
      "its seat in England. It included writers of both the eighteenth\n",
      "and nineteenth centuries, but the most famous were Bentham\n",
      "(1748-1832; Introduction to the Principles of Morals and\n",

      "                            \n",
      "not so much in finding a new basis for authority as in finding\n",
      "some working standard for testing existing claims to authority\n",
      "on the part of laws and institutions. They felt that moral sense\n",
      "was likely to be arbitrary; persons become strongly attached to\n",
      "certain habits and ways of looking at things, and come to feel\n",
      "that these are the only right ways. And on the other hand the\n",
      "Utilitarians were suspicious of \"reason\"; for they held that men\n",
      "are likely to claim that reason sanctions this or forbids that,\n",
      "when it is really some prejudice or old established habit that\n",
      "asserts itself. They suspected therefore what they called the a priori\n",
      "method, and believed it to be more in accordance with the\n",
      "modern spirit of science to look to human observation and\n",
      "experience in order to find what men value. Instead of judging conduct\n",
      "by feelings or intuition, they would judge its consequences. The\n",
      "particular kind of consequences which they thought most\n",
      "important were again another outcome of certain aspects of this\n",
      "modern development. Each individual, they held, is really seeking his\n",
      "happiness above everything else. If then we are to find a moral\n",
      "standard in what men actually value, we must find it not in the\n",
      "heavens above, but in human happiness. But—and here come in\n",
      "the revolt against the special privilege of an upper class, and the\n",
      "democratic sympathetic regard for all sorts and conditions of\n",
      "men—when we take happiness as our standard, it must be the\n",
      "happiness of the greatest number, \"every man to count as one.\"\n",

      "10. The Nature of Moral Theory\n",
      "§ 1. Reflective Morality and Ethical Theory\n",
      "The intellectual distinction between customary and\n",
      "reflective morality is clearly marked. The former places the\n",
      "standard and rules of conduct in ancestral habit; the latter appeals to\n",
      "conscience, reason, or to some principle which includes thought.\n",
      "The distinction is as important as it is definite, for it shifts the\n",
      "centre of gravity in morality. Nevertheless the distinction is\n",
      "relative rather than absolute. Some degree of reflective thought must\n",
      "have entered occasionally into systems which in the main were\n",
      "founded on social wont and use, while in contemporary morals,\n",
      "even when the need of critical judgment is most recognized,\n",
      "there is an immense amount of conduct that is merely\n",
      "accommodated to social usage. In what follows we shall, accordingly,\n",
      "emphasize the difference in principle between customary and\n",
      "reflective morals rather than try to describe different historic and\n",
      "social epochs. In principle a revolution was wrought when\n",
      "Hebrew prophets and Greek seers asserted that conduct is not truly\n",
      "conduct unless it springs from the heart, from personal desires\n",
      "and affections, or from personal insight and rational choice.\n",
      "The change was revolutionary not only because it displaced\n",
      "custom from the supreme position, but even more because it\n",
      "entailed the necessity of criticizing existing customs and\n",
      "institutions from a new point of view. Standards which were regarded\n",
      "by the followers of tradition as the basis of duty and\n",
      "responsibility were denounced by prophet and philosopher as the source of\n",
      "moral corruption. These proclaimed the hollowness of outer\n",
      "conformity and insisted upon the cleansing of the heart and the\n",
      "clarifying of the mind as preconditions of any genuinely good\n",
      "conduct.\n",
      "One great source of the abiding interest which Greek thought\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "has for the western world is that it records so clearly the struggle\n",
      "to make the transition from customary to reflective conduct. In\n",
      "the Platonic dialogues for example Socrates is represented as\n",
      "constantly raising the question of whether morals can be taught.\n",
      "Some other thinker (like Protagoras in the dialogue of that name)\n",
      "is brought in who points out that habituation to existing moral\n",
      "traditions is actually taught. Parents and teachers constantly\n",
      "admonish the young \"pointing out that one act is just, another\n",
      "unjust; one honorable and another dishonorable; one holy and\n",
      "another unholy.\" When a youth emerges from parental tutelage,\n",
      "the State takes up the task, for \"the community compels them to\n",
      "learn laws and to live after the pattern of the laws and not\n",
      "according to their own fancies.\"\n",
      "In reply, Socrates raises the question of the foundations of\n",
      "such teaching, of its right to be termed a genuine teaching of\n",
      "virtue, and in effect points out the need of a morality which shall be\n",
      "stable and secure because based upon constant and universal\n",
      "principles. Parents and teachers differ in their injunctions and\n",
      "prohibitions; different communities have different laws; the\n",
      "same community changes its habits with time and with\n",
      "transformations of government. How shall we know who among the\n",
      "teachers, whether individuals or States, is right? Is there no basis\n",
      "for morals except this fluctuating one? It is not enough to praise\n",
      "and blame, reward and punish, enjoin and prohibit. The essence\n",
      "of morals, it is implied, is to know the reason for these\n",
      "customary instructions; to ascertain the criterion which insures their\n",
      "being just. And in other dialogues, it is frequently asserted that\n",
      "even if the mass must follow custom and law without insight,\n",
      "those who make laws and fix customs should have sure insight\n",
      "into enduring principles, or else the blind will be leading the\n",

      "Since the change from customary to reflective morality\n",
      "shifts emphasis from conformity to prevailing modes of action\n",
      "over to personal disposition and attitudes, the first business of\n",
      "moral theory is to obtain in outline an idea of the factors which\n",
      "constitute personal disposition. In its general features, the traits\n",
      "of a reflective moral situation have long been clear; doubts and\n",
      "disputes arise chiefly as to the relation which they bear to one\n",
      "another. The formula was well stated by Aristotle. The doer of\n",
      "the moral deed must have a certain \"state of mind\" in doing it.\n",
      "First, he must know what he is doing; secondly, he must choose\n",
      "it, and choose it for itself, and thirdly, the act must be the\n",
      "expression of a formed and stable character. In other words, the act\n",
      "must be voluntary; that is, it must manifest a choice, and for full\n",
      "morality at least, the choice must be an expression of the general\n",
      "tenor and set of personality. It must involve awareness of what\n",
      "one is about; a fact which in the concrete signifies that there\n",
      "must be a purpose, an aim, an end in view, something for the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "sake of which the particular act is done. The acts of infants,\n",
      "imbeciles, insane persons in some cases, have no moral quality;\n",
      "they do not know what they are about. Children learn early in\n",
      "life to appeal to accident, that is, absence of intention and\n",
      "purpose on their part, as an excuse for deeds that have bad\n",
      "consequences. When they exculpate themselves on the ground that\n",
      "they did not \"mean\" to do something they show a realization\n",
      "that intent is a normal part of a moral situation. Again, there is\n",
      "no choice, no implication of personal disposition, when one\n",
      "is coerced by superior physical power. Even when force takes the\n",
      "form of threats, rather than of immediate exercise of it, \"duress\"\n",
      "is at least a mitigating circumstance. It is recognized that fear of\n",
      "extreme harm to life and limb will overpower choice in all but\n",
      "those of heroic make-up.\n",
      "An act must be the expression of a formed and stable\n",
      "character. But stability of character is an affair of degrees, and is not to\n",
      "be taken absolutely. No human being, however mature, has a\n",
      "completely formed character, while any child in the degree in\n",
      "which he has acquired attitudes and habits has a stable character\n",
      "to that extent. The point of including this qualification is that it\n",
      "suggests a kind of running scale of acts, some of which proceed\n",
      "from greater depths of the self, while others are more casual,\n",
      "more due to accidental and variable circumstances. We overlook\n",
      "acts performed under conditions of great stress or of physical\n",
      "weakness on the ground that the doer was \"not himself\" at the\n",
      "time. Yet we should not overdo this interpretation. Conduct may\n",
      "be eccentric and erratic just because a person in the past has\n",
      "formed that kind of disposition. An unstable character may be\n",
      "the product of acts deliberately chosen aforetime. A man is not\n",
      "himself in a state of intoxication. But a difference will be made\n",
      "between the case in which a usually temperate man is overcome\n",
      "by drink, and the case in which intoxication is so habitual as to\n",
      "be a sign of a habit formed by choice and of character.\n",
      "May acts be voluntary, that is, be expressions of desire, intent,\n",
      "choice, and habitual disposition, and yet be morally neutral,\n",
      "indifferent? To all appearances the answer must be in the\n",
      "affirmative. We rise in the morning, dress, eat, and go about our\n",
      "usual business without attaching moral significance to what we\n",
      "are doing. These are the regular and normal things to do, and the\n",
      "acts, while many of them are performed intentionally and with a\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "knowledge of what we are doing, are a matter of course. So with\n",
      "the student's, merchant's, engineer's, lawyer's, or doctor's daily\n",
      "round of affairs. We feel that it would be rather morbid if a moral\n",
      "issue were raised in connection with each act; we should\n",
      "probably suspect some mental disorder if it were, at least some\n",
      "weakness in power of decision. On the other hand, we speak of the\n",
      "persons in question going about their daily round of duties. If we\n",
      "omitted from our estimate of moral character all the deeds done\n",
      "in the performance of daily tasks, satisfaction of recurrent needs,\n",
      "meeting of responsibilities, each slight perhaps in itself but\n",
      "enormous in mass, morality would be a weak and sickly thing indeed.\n",
      "The inconsistency between these two points of view is only\n",
      "apparent. Many acts are done not only without thought of their\n",
      "moral quality but with practically no thought of any kind. Yet\n",
      "these acts are preconditions of other acts having significant\n",
      "value. A criminal on his way to commit a crime and a benevolent\n",
      "person on his way to a deed of mercy both have to walk or ride.\n",
      "Such acts, non-moral in isolation, derive moral significance from\n",
      "the ends to which they lead. If a man who had an important\n",
      "engagement to keep declined to get out of bed in the morning from\n",
      "sheer laziness, the indirect moral quality of a seemingly\n",
      "automatic act would be apparent. A vast number of acts are\n",
      "performed which seem to be trivial in themselves but which in\n",
      "reality are the supports and buttresses of acts in which definite moral\n",
      "considerations are present. The person who completely ignored\n",
      "the connection of the great number of more or less routine acts\n",
      "with the small number in which there is a clear moral issue\n",
      "would be an utterly independable person.\n",
      "§ 3. Conduct and Character\n",
      "These facts are implicitly recognized in common speech\n",
      "by the use of the word conduct. The word expresses continuity\n",
      "of action, an idea which we have already met in the\n",
      "conception of a stable and formed character. Where there is conduct\n",
      "there is not simply a succession of disconnected acts but each\n",
      "thing done carries forward an underlying tendency and intent,\n",
      "conducting, leading up, to further acts and to a final fulfillment\n",
      "or consummation. Moral development, in the training given by\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "others and in the education one secures for oneself, consists in\n",
      "becoming aware that our acts are connected with one another;\n",
      "thereby an ideal of conduct is substituted for the blind and\n",
      "thoughtless performance of isolated acts. Even when a person\n",
      "has attained a certain degree of moral stability, his temptations\n",
      "usually take the form of fancying that this particular act will not\n",
      "count, that it is an exception, that for this just one occasion it\n",
      "will not do any harm. His \"temptation\" is to disregard that\n",
      "continuity of sequence in which one act leads on to others and to a\n",
      "cumulative result.\n",
      "We commence life under the influence of appetites and\n",
      "impulses, and of direct response to immediate stimuli of heat and\n",
      "cold, comfort and pain, light, noise, etc. The hungry child\n",
      "snatches at food. To him the act is innocent and natural. But he\n",
      "brings down reproach upon himself; he is told that he is\n",
      "unmannerly, inconsiderate, greedy; that he should wait till he is served,\n",
      "till his turn comes. He is made aware that his act has other\n",
      "connections than the one he had assigned to it: the immediate\n",
      "satisfaction of hunger. He learns to look at single acts not as single\n",
      "but as related links in a chain. Thus the idea of a series, an idea\n",
      "which is the essence of conduct, gradually takes the place of a\n",
      "mere succession of disconnected acts.\n",
      "This idea of conduct as a serial whole solves the problem of\n",
      "morally indifferent acts. Every act has potential moral\n",
      "significance, because it is, through its consequences, part of a larger\n",
      "whole of behavior. A person starts to open a window because he\n",
      "feels the need of air—no act could be more \"natural,\" more\n",
      "morally indifferent in appearance. But he remembers that his\n",
      "associate is an invalid and sensitive to drafts. He now sees his act in\n",
      "two different lights, possessed of two different values, and he has\n",
      "to make a choice. The potential moral import of a seemingly\n",
      "insignificant act has come home to him. Or, wishing to take\n",
      "exercise, there are two routes open to him. Ordinarily it would be a\n",
      "mere matter of personal taste which he would choose. But he\n",
      "recalls that the more pleasing of the two is longer, and that if he went\n",
      "that way he might be unable to keep an appointment of\n",
      "importance. He now has to place his act in a larger context of continuity\n",
      "and determine which ulterior consequence he prizes most:\n",
      "personal pleasure or meeting the needs of another. Thus while there\n",
      "is no single act which must under all circumstances have\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "conscious moral quality, there is no act, since it is a part of conduct,\n",
      "which may not have definitive moral significance. There is no\n",
      "hard and fast line between the morally indifferent and the\n",
      "morally significant. Matthew Arnold expressed a prevailing idea\n",
      "when he said that conduct—in the moral sense—is three-fourths\n",
      "of life. Although he probably assigned it a higher ratio than most\n",
      "persons would, the statement expresses a widely shared idea,\n",
      "namely, that morality has to do with a clearly marked out\n",
      "portion of our life, leaving other things indifferent. Our conclusion\n",
      "is different. It is that potentially conduct is one hundred per cent\n",
      "of our conscious life. For all acts are so tied together that any\n",
      "one of them may have to be judged as an expression of character.\n",
      "On the other hand, there is no act which may not, under some\n",
      "circumstances, be morally indifferent, for at the time there may\n",
      "be no need for consideration of its relation to character. There is\n",
      "no better evidence of a well formed moral character than\n",
      "knowledge of when to raise the moral issue and when not. It implies a\n",
      "sensitiveness to values which is the token of a balanced\n",
      "personality. Undoubtedly many persons are so callous or so careless\n",
      "that they do not raise the moral issue often enough. But there are\n",
      "others so unbalanced that they hamper and paralyze conduct by\n",
      "indulging in what approaches a mania of doubt.\n",
      "It is not enough to show that the binding together of acts so\n",
      "that they lead up to and carry one another forward constitutes\n",
      "conduct. We have also to consider why and how it is that they\n",
      "are thus bound together into a whole, instead of forming, as in\n",
      "the case of physical events, a mere succession. The answer is\n",
      "contained in rendering explicit the allusions which have been made\n",
      "to disposition and character. If an act were connected with other\n",
      "acts merely in the way in which the flame of a match is connected\n",
      "with an explosion of gunpowder, there would be action, but not\n",
      "conduct. But our actions not only lead up to other actions which\n",
      "follow as their effects but they also leave an enduring impress on\n",
      "the one who performs them, strengthening and weakening\n",
      "permanent tendencies to act. This fact is familiar to us in the\n",
      "existence of habit.\n",
      "We are, however, likely to have a conception of habit which\n",
      "needs to be deepened and extended. For we are given to thinking\n",
      "of a habit as simply a recurrent external mode of action, like\n",
      "smoking or swearing, being neat or negligent in clothes and\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "person, taking exercise, or playing games. But habit reaches even\n",
      "more significantly down into the very structure of the self; it\n",
      "signifies a building up and solidifying of certain desires; an\n",
      "increased sensitiveness and responsiveness to certain stimuli, a\n",
      "confirmed or an impaired capacity to attend to and think about\n",
      "certain things. Habit covers in other words the very make-up of\n",
      "desire, intent, choice, disposition which gives an act its voluntary\n",
      "quality. And this aspect of habit is much more important than\n",
      "that which is suggested merely by the tendency to repeated outer\n",
      "action, for the significance of the latter lies in the permanence of\n",
      "the personal disposition which is the real cause of the outer acts\n",
      "and of their resemblance to one another. Acts are not linked up\n",
      "together to form conduct in and of themselves, but because of\n",
      "their common relation to an enduring and single condition—\n",
      "the self or character as the abiding unity in which different acts\n",
      "leave their lasting traces. If one surrenders to a momentary\n",
      "impulse, the significant thing is not the particular act which\n",
      "follows, but the strengthening of the power of that impulse—this\n",
      "strengthening is the reality of that which we call habit. In giving\n",
      "way, the person in so far commits himself not just to that isolated\n",
      "act but to a course of action, to a line of behavior.\n",
      "Sometimes a juncture is so critical that a person, in deciding\n",
      "upon what course he will take, feels that his future, his very\n",
      "being, is at stake. Such cases are obviously of great practical\n",
      "importance for the person concerned. They are of importance for\n",
      "theory, because some degree of what is conspicuous in these\n",
      "momentous cases is found in every voluntary decision. Indeed,\n",
      "also it belongs to acts performed impulsively without deliberate\n",
      "choice. In such cases, it is later experience which makes us aware\n",
      "of the serious commitment implied in an earlier act. We find\n",
      "ourselves involved in embarrassing complications and on reflection\n",
      "we trace the cause of our embarrassment to a deed which we\n",
      "performed casually, without reflection and deliberate intent. Then\n",
      "we reflect upon the value of the entire class of actions. We realize\n",
      "the difference which exists between the thought of an act before\n",
      "it is done and as it is experienced afterwards. As Goldsmith so\n",
      "truly said \"In the first place, we cook the dish to our own\n",
      "appetite; in the latter, Nature cooks it for us.\" We plunge at first\n",
      "into action pushed by impulse, drawn by appetite. After we have\n",
      "acted and consequences which are unexpected and undesired\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "show themselves, we begin to reflect. We review the wisdom or\n",
      "the rightness of the course which we engaged in with little or no\n",
      "thought. Our judgment turns backward for its material;\n",
      "something has turned out differently than we anticipated, and so we\n",
      "think back to discover what was the matter. But while the\n",
      "material of the judgment comes to us from the past, what really\n",
      "concerns us is what we shall do the next time; the function of\n",

      "In reaching the conclusion that conduct and character\n",
      "are morally one and the same thing, first taken as effect and then\n",
      "as causal and productive factor, we have virtually disposed of\n",
      "one outstanding point of controversy in moral theory. The issue\n",
      "in question is that between those who hold that motives are the\n",
      "only thing which count morally and those who hold that\n",
      "consequences are alone of moral import. On one side stand those who,\n",
      "like Kant, say that results actually attained are of no importance\n",
      "morally speaking, because they do not depend upon the will\n",
      "alone; that only the will can be good or bad in the moral sense.\n",
      "On the other side, are those who, like Bentham, say that\n",
      "morality consists in producing consequences which contribute to the\n",
      "general welfare, and that motives do not count at all save as they\n",
      "happen to influence the consequences one way or another. One\n",
      "theory puts sole emphasis upon attitude, upon how the chosen\n",
      "act is conceived and inspired; the other theory lays stress solely\n",
      "upon what is actually done, upon the objective content of the\n",
      "deed in the way of its effect upon others. Our analysis shows that\n",
      "both views are one-sided. At whichever end we begin we find\n",
      "ourselves intellectually compelled to consider the other end. We\n",
      "are dealing not with two different things but with two poles of\n",
      "the same thing. The school of Bentham, for example, does not\n",
      "hold that every consequence is of importance in judging an act\n",
      "morally. It would not say that the act of a surgeon is necessarily\n",
      "to be condemned because an operation results in the death of a\n",
      "patient. It limits the theory to foreseen and desired consequences.\n",
      "The intended consequence, the intention, of the surgeon was to\n",
      "save life; morally his act was beneficent, although unsuccessful\n",

      "The only thing that counts morally is that he intended to effect\n",
      "certain consequences.\n",
      "The protest contained in this position against locating morals\n",
      "in the conscious feeling which attends the doing of an act is\n",
      "valuable and valid. Persons, children and grown-ups alike, often say\n",
      "in justification for some act that turned out badly that they\n",
      "meant well; they allege some innocent or amiable feeling as the\n",
      "\"motive\" of the act. The real fact in all probability was that they\n",
      "took next to no pains to think out the consequences of what they\n",
      "proposed to do. They kept their minds upon any favorable\n",
      "results that might be fancied to follow, and glossed over or kept\n",
      "from view its undesirable consequences. If \"motive\" signified the\n",
      "emotional state which happens to exist in consciousness at the\n",
      "time of acting, Bentham's position would be entirely sound.\n",
      "Since that conception of motives is more or less prevalent, he was\n",
      "not setting up a man of straw to hit, but was attacking a doctrine\n",
      "which is morally dangerous. For it encourages men to neglect the\n",
      "purpose and bearing of their actions, and to justify what they\n",
      "feel inclined to do on the ground that their feelings when doing it\n",
      "were innocent and amiable.\n",
      "The underlying identification of motive with personal feeling\n",

      "emotion is a good deal more than a bare \"feeling\"; anger is not\n",
      "so much a state of conscious feeling as it is a tendency to act in a\n",
      "destructive way towards whatever arouses it. It is doubtful if a\n",
      "miserly person is conscious of feelings of stinginess; he rather\n",

      "action only as they are also prized and desired. The distinction\n",

      "But in its extreme form it suffers from the same one-sidedness\n",
      "as does the Benthamite theory of intention, although in the\n",
      "opposite direction. It is possible to make good sense of the\n",
      "proposition that it is the \"will\" which counts morally, rather than\n",

      "This emphasis upon character is not peculiar to any special\n",

      "manifestation and interaction of personalities. It is the same interest which\n",
      "shows itself in the drama where the colorful display of incidents\n",
      "is, save in the melodramatic and sentimental, a display of the\n",
      "outworking of character. Political thought tends to be too much\n",
      "rather than too little concerned with personality at the expense of\n",

      "persons of from a score to fifty racial origins. The walls and barriers\n",

      "No theory can operate in a vacuum. Moral as well as\n",
      "physical theory requires a body of dependable data, and a set of\n",
      "intelligible working hypotheses. Where shall moral theory find\n",
      "the material with which to satisfy these needs?\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "1. While all that has been said about the extent of change in all\n",
      "conditions of life is true, nevertheless there has been no complete\n",
      "breach of continuity. From the beginning of human life, men\n",
      "have arrived at some conclusions regarding what is proper and\n",
      "fair in human relationships, and have engaged in working out\n",
      "codes of conduct. The dogmatist, whether made so by tradition\n",
      "or through some special insight which he claims as his own, will\n",
      "pick out from the many conflicting codes that one which agrees\n",
      "the most closely with his own education and taste. A genuinely\n",
      "reflective morals will look upon all the codes as possible data; it\n",
      "will consider the conditions under which they arose; the\n",
      "methods which consciously or unconsciously determined their\n",
      "formation and acceptance; it will inquire into their applicability in\n",
      "present conditions. It will neither insist dogmatically upon some\n",
      "of them, nor idly throw them all away as of no significance. It\n",
      "will treat them as a storehouse of information and possible\n",
      "indications of what is now right and good.\n",
      "2. Closely connected with this body of material in codes and\n",
      "convictions, is the more consciously elaborated material of legal\n",
      "history, judicial decisions, and legislative activity. Here we have a\n",
      "long experimentation in working out principles for direction of\n",
      "human beings in their conduct. Something of the same kind is\n",
      "true of the workings of all great human institutions. The history\n",
      "of the family, of industry, of property systems, of government\n",
      "and the state, of education and art, is full of instructions about\n",
      "modes of human conduct and the consequences of adopting this\n",
      "or that mode of conduct. Informal material of the same sort\n",
      "abounds in biographies, especially of those who have been\n",
      "selected as the great moral teachers of the race.\n",
      "3. A resource which mankind was late in utilizing and which it\n",
      "has hardly as yet begun to draw upon adequately is found in the\n",
      "various sciences, especially those closest to man, such as biology,\n",
      "physiology, hygiene and medicine, psychology and psychiatry, as\n",
      "well as statistics, sociology, economics, and politics. The latter\n",
      "upon the whole present problems rather than solutions. But it is\n",
      "well to get problems more clearly in mind, and the very fact that\n",
      "these social disciplines usually approach their material\n",
      "independently of consideration of moral values has a certain intellectual\n",
      "advantage for the moralist. For although he still has to translate\n",

      "detachment from preformed and set moral convictions, since the\n",
      "latter may be only the prejudices of tradition or temperament.\n",
      "From the biological and psychological sciences, there are\n",
      "derivable highly valuable techniques for study of human and social\n",
      "problems and the opening of new vistas. For example, the\n",
      "discovery of the conditions and the consequences of health of body,\n",
      "personal and public, which these sciences have already effected,\n",
      "opens the way to a relatively new body of moral interests and\n",
      "responsibilities. It is impossible any longer to regard health and\n",
      "the conditions which affect it as a merely technical or physical\n",
      "matter. Its ramifications with moral order and disorder have\n",
      "been clearly demonstrated.\n",
      "4. Then there is the body of definitely theoretical methods and\n",
      "conclusions which characterize European history for the last\n",
      "two thousand years, to say nothing of the doctrines of Asiatic\n",
      "thinkers for a still longer period. Keen intellects have been\n",
      "engaged in analysis and in the development of directive principles\n",
      "on a rational basis. Alternative positions and their implications\n",
      "have been explored and systematically developed. At first sight,\n",
      "the variety of logically incompatible positions which have been\n",
      "taken by theorists may seem to the student to indicate simply a\n",
      "scene of confusion and conflict. But when studied more closely\n",
      "they reveal the complexity of moral situations, a complexity so\n",
      "great that while every theory may be found to ignore factors and\n",
      "relations which ought to be taken into account, each one will\n",
      "also be found to bring to light some phase of the moral life\n",
      "demanding reflective attention, and which, save for it, might have\n",
      "remained hidden. The proper inference to be drawn is not that\n",
      "we should make a mechanical compromise or an eclectic\n",
      "combination of the different theories, but that each great system of\n",
      "moral thought brings to light some point of view from which the\n",

      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "classic theories about morals which have left a moral impress on\n",
      "civilization. A survey of these theories brings out certain\n",
      "underlying differences of emphasis and resulting intellectual problems,\n",
      "which the student will be put in possession of, before taking up\n",
      "the conceptions themselves. Roughly speaking, theories will be\n",
      "found to vary primarily because some of them attach chief\n",
      "importance to purposes and ends, leading to the concept of the\n",
      "Good as ultimate; while some others are impressed by the\n",
      "importance of law and regulation, leading up to the supremacy of\n",
      "the concepts of Duty and the Right; while a third set regards\n",
      "approbation and disapprobation, praise and blame as the primary\n",
      "moral fact, thus terminating with making the concepts of Virtue\n",
      "and Vice central. Within each tendency, there are further\n",
      "differences of opinion as to what is the Good, the nature of Duty, Law,\n",
      "and the Right, and the relative standing of different virtues.\n",
      "1. That men form purposes, strive for the realization of ends,\n",
      "is an established fact. If it is asked why they do so, the only\n",
      "answer to the question, aside from saying that they do so\n",
      "unreasonably from mere blind custom, is that they strive to attain\n",
      "certain goals because they believe that these ends have an intrinsic\n",
      "value of their own; they are good, satisfactory. The chief province\n",
      "of reason in practical matters is to discriminate between ends that\n",
      "merely seem good and those which are really so—between\n",
      "specious, deceptive goods, and lasting true goods. Men have desires;\n",
      "immediately and apart from reflection they want this and that\n",
      "thing, food, a companion, money, fame and repute, health,\n",
      "distinction among their fellows, power, the love of friends, the\n",
      "admiration of rivals, etc. But why do they want these things?\n",
      "Because value is attributed to them; because they are thought to be\n",
      "good. As the scholastics said, we desire sub specie boni; beneath\n",
      "all the special ends striven for is the common idea of the Good,\n",
      "the Satisfying. Theories which regard ends as the important\n",
      "thing in morals accordingly make the conception of Good\n",
      "central in theory. Since men often take things to be good in\n",

      "this group of theories is to determine the real good as distinct\n",
      "from the things that merely seem to be so, or, what is the same\n",
      "thing, the permanent good from transitory and fleeting goods.\n",
      "From the side of attitude and disposition, the fundamental matter\n",
      "is therefore the insight and wisdom which is able to discriminate\n",
      "between ends that deceptively promise satisfaction and the ends\n",

      "                            \n",
      "which truly constitute it. The great problem of morals on this\n",
      "score is the attainment of right knowledge.\n",
      "2. To other observers of human life, the control of desire and\n",
      "appetite has seemed much more fundamental than their\n",
      "satisfaction. Many of them are suspicious of the very principle of desire\n",
      "and of the ends which are connected with it. Desire seems to\n",
      "them so personal and so bent on its own satisfaction as to be the\n",
      "source of temptation, to be the cause which leads men to deviate\n",
      "from the lawful course of action. Empirically, these thinkers are\n",
      "struck by the role played in human government by commands,\n",
      "prohibitions, and all the devices that regulate the play of\n",
      "passions and desires. To them, the great problem is to discover some\n",
      "underlying authority which shall control the formation of aims\n",
      "and purposes. The lower animals follow desire and appetite\n",
      "because they have no conception of regulative law; men have the\n",
      "consciousness of being bound by a principle superior to impulse\n",
      "and want. The morally right and the naturally satisfying are\n",
      "often in conflict and the heart of the moral struggle is to\n",
      "subordinate good to the demands of duty. The theory that makes ends\n",
      "supreme has been called the teleological (from the Greek, τέλος ,\n",
      "end); the theory which makes law and duty supreme, the jural.\n",
      "3. There is another group of thinkers who feel that the\n",
      "principle of ends and rational insight places altogether too much\n",
      "emphasis upon the intellectual factor in human nature, and that the\n",
      "theory of law and duty is too legal, external, and stringent. They\n",
      "are struck by the enormous part played in human life by facts of\n",
      "approbation and condemnation, praise and blame, reward and\n",
      "punishment, encouragement of some courses of action,\n",
      "resentment at others, and pressure to keep persons from adopting\n",
      "those courses which are frowned upon. They find in human\n",
      "nature a spontaneous tendency to favor some lines of conduct, and\n",
      "to censure and penalize other modes of action, a tendency which\n",
      "in time is extended from acts to the dispositions from which the\n",
      "acts flow. Out of the mass of approbations arise the ideas of virtue\n",

      "The question of what ends a man should live for does\n",
      "not arise as a general problem in customary morality. It is\n",
      "forestalled by the habits and institutions which a person finds\n",
      "existing all about him. What others, especially elders, are doing\n",
      "provides the ends for which one should act. These ends are\n",
      "sanctioned by tradition; they are hallowed by the semi-divine\n",
      "character of the ancestors who instituted the customs; they are set forth\n",
      "by the wise elders, and are enforced by the rulers. Individuals\n",
      "trespass, deviating from these established purposes, but they do\n",
      "so with the conviction that thereby social condemnation,\n",
      "reenforced by supernatural penalties inflicted by divine beings,\n",
      "ensues. There are today multitudes of men and women who take\n",
      "their aims from what they observe to be going on around them.\n",
      "They accept the aims provided by religious teachers, by political\n",
      "authorities, by persons in the community who have prestige.\n",
      "Failure to adopt such a course would seem to many persons to be\n",
      "a kind of moral rebellion or anarchy. Many other persons find\n",
      "their ends practically forced upon them. Because of lack of\n",
      "education and because of economic stress they for the most part do\n",
      "just what they have to do. In the absence of the possibility of real\n",
      "choice, such a thing as reflection upon purposes and the attempt\n",
      "to frame a general theory of ends and of the good would seem to\n",
      "be idle luxuries.\n",
      "There can, however, be no such thing as reflective morality\n",
      "except where men seriously ask by what purposes they should\n",
      "direct their conduct and why they should do so; what it is which\n",
      "makes their purposes good. This intellectual search for ends is\n",

      "with formation of ends. Moreover, when social change is great,\n",
      "and a great variety of conflicting aims are suggested, reflection\n",
      "cannot be limited to the selection of one end out of a number\n",

      "common purpose running through separate acts. An end-in-view\n",
      "gives unity and continuity, whether it be the securing of an\n",

      "uses shall victory when achieved be put? At least that question is\n",
      "bound to be asked, provided men are intelligently interested in\n",
      "their behavior and are not governed by chance and the pressure\n",
      "of the passing moment. The development of inclusive and\n",

      "Habit and impulse have consequences, just as every\n",
      "occurrence has effects. But merely as habit, impulse, and appetite they\n",
      "do not lead to foresight of what will happen as a consequence of\n",
      "their operation. An animal is moved by hunger and the outcome\n",
      "is satisfaction of appetite and the nourishment of the body. In\n",
      "the case of a human being, having mature experience upon\n",

      "A purpose or aim represents a craving, an urge, translated into\n",
      "the idea of an object, as blind hunger is transformed into a\n",
      "purpose through the thought of a food which is wanted, say flour,\n",

      "propulsive force of mere habit and appetite. In distinction from\n",
      "the first, it involves a want, an impulsive urge and forward drive;\n",
      "in distinction from the second, it involves an intellectual factor,\n",
      "the thought of an object which gives meaning and direction to\n",
      "the urge. This connection between purpose and desire is the\n",
      "source of one whole class of moral problems. Attainment of\n",
      "learning, professional skill, wealth, power, would not be\n",
      "animating purposes unless the thought of some result were unified\n",

      "an impulse into a desire centered in an object. But on the other\n",
      "end, a strong craving tends to exclude thought. It is in haste for\n",
      "its own speedy realization. An intense appetite, say thirst, impels\n",
      "to immediate action without thought of its consequences, as a\n",
      "very thirsty man at sea tends to drink salt water without regard\n",
      "to objective results. Deliberation and inquiry, on the other hand,\n",
      "take time; they demand delay, the deferring of immediate action.\n",
      "Craving does not look beyond the moment, but it is of the very\n",

      "§ 2. Ends and the Good: The Union of Desire and Thought\n",
      "There is accordingly a conflict brought about within the\n",
      "self. The impetus of reflection when it is aroused is to look\n",
      "ahead; to hunt out and to give weight to remoter consequences.\n",

      "which result are the ground for the theory which holds that there\n",
      "is an inherent warfare in the moral life between desire and\n",
      "reason; the theory that appetite and desire tend to delude us with\n",
      "deceptive goods, leading us away from the true end that reason\n",
      "holds up to view. In consequence, some moralists have gone so\n",
      "far as to hold that appetite and impulse are inherently evil, being\n",
      "expressions of the lust of the flesh, a power which pulls men\n",
      "away from the ends which reason approves. This view, however,\n",
      "is impossible. No idea or object could operate as an end and\n",
      "become a purpose unless it were connected with some need;\n",
      "otherwise it would be a mere idea without any moving and impelling\n",
      "power.\n",
      "In short, while there is conflict, it is not between desire and\n",
      "reason, but between a desire which wants a near-by object and a\n",
      "desire which wants an object which is seen by thought to occur\n",
      "in consequence of an intervening series of conditions, or in the\n",
      "\"long run\"; it is a conflict between two objects presented in\n",
      "thought, one corresponding to a want or appetite just as it\n",
      "presents itself in isolation, the other corresponding to the want\n",
      "thought of in relation to other wants. Fear may suggest flight or\n",
      "lying to a man as ends to be sought; further thought may bring a\n",
      "man to a conviction that steadfastness and truthfulness will\n",
      "insure a much larger and more enduring good. There is an idea in\n",
      "each case; in the first case, an idea of personal safety; in the\n",
      "second instance, an idea of, say, the safety of others to be achieved\n",
      "by remaining at a post. In each case also there is desire; in the\n",
      "first instance a desire which lies close to natural impulse and\n",
      "instinct; in the second instance, a desire which would not be\n",
      "aroused were it not that thought brings into view remote\n",
      "consequences. In one case, original impulse dictates the thought of the\n",
      "object; in the other case, this original impulse is transformed into\n",
      "a different desire because of objects which thought holds up to\n",
      "view. But no matter how elaborate and how rational is the object\n",
      "of thought, it is impotent unless it arouses desire.\n",

      "our practical experience. Sometimes persons who have been\n",
      "subjected to one-sided moral training feel shame and remorse\n",
      "because some malicious or foul idea has come into their minds,\n",
      "even though they have not acted upon it but have speedily\n",
      "dismissed it. Momentary impulses enter our minds by all sorts of\n",
      "channels. Unless a person is responsible for having previously\n",

      "ground for moral blame of himself, merely because the idea of a\n",
      "certain end has \"popped into his head.\" His moral condition\n",
      "depends upon what he does with the idea after it has presented\n",
      "itself. That is to say, the real object of moral judgment is a union\n",
      "between thought and purposeful desire. There is also a\n",
      "temptation to indulge freely in purely imaginative satisfactions of\n",
      "desires known to be unworthy, on the ground that no harm is done\n",

      "The same result is reached when we consider inhibition of\n",
      "desire versus free surrender to it. There are different kinds of\n",
      "inhibition, and they have very different moral values and\n",
      "consequences. One sort is a deliberate exclusion of the appetite and\n",
      "impulse from the field of thinking and observation; there is then\n",
      "a suppression which simply drives the desire into underground\n",
      "channels. In this case there is no weakening of its power, but only\n",
      "a shift so that it exercises its power indirectly. On the other hand,\n",
      "all thinking exercises by its very nature an inhibitory effect. It\n",
      "delays the operation of desire, and tends to call up new\n",
      "considerations which alter the nature of the action to which one felt\n",

      "A third confirmation in practical experience is found in the\n",
      "issue of sacrifice versus indulgence. Here too we find that the true\n",
      "solution of the problem lies in bringing thought and desire\n",
      "together instead of pitting them against each other. Sometimes\n",
      "sacrifice is made an end in itself. This is equivalent to treating an\n",
      "impulse as evil in and of itself. Sacrifice of this sort ends in\n",
      "maiming life, curtailing power, and narrowing the horizon of\n",
      "opportunities for action. But there is another kind of renunciation\n",
      "which takes place when some end is perceived which is judged to\n",
      "be more worthy, and desire is attached to this better end which\n",
      "thought discloses. No one can have everything he wants; our\n",
      "powers are too limited and our environment too unyielding to\n",

      "we see another which is of greater worth and which evokes a\n",
      "more inclusive and a more enduring desire. We then escape from\n",
      "that kind of renunciation which Goethe called blasphemous, as\n",
      "well as from that which makes it a good in and of itself. For\n",
      "as Goethe pointed out, renunciation tends to be thoughtless.\n",
      "\"We renounce particular things at each moment by sheer levity,\n",
      "if only we can grasp something else the next moment. We merely\n",
      "put one passion in place of another: business, inclinations,\n",
      "amusements, hobbies. We try them all, one after another, only to cry\n",
      "out in the end that 'all is vanity.'\" Once more, thoughtful desire\n",
      "is the alternative both to suppression of desire and to yielding to\n",
      "a desire just as it first presents itself.\n",
      "An understanding of the relationship between the propulsive,\n",
      "urging force of desire and the widening scope of thought enables\n",
      "us to understand what is meant by will, especially by the term a\n",

      "manifestation is nothing better than a great ado about nothing. In reality\n",
      "\"strength of will\" (or, to speak more advisedly, of character)\n",
      "consists of an abiding identification of impulse with thought, in\n",
      "which impulse provides the drive while thought supplies\n",
      "consecutiveness, patience, and persistence, leading to a unified course\n",
      "of conduct. It is not the same as obstinacy because instead of\n",
      "insisting on repetition of the same act, it is observant of changes of\n",
      "conditions and is flexible in making new adjustments. It is\n",
      "thinking which is persisted in, even though special ends in view change,\n",
      "while the obstinate person insists upon the same act even when\n",
      "thinking would disclose a wiser course. In the passage quoted,\n",
      "James says that the difficulty in holding to a resolution when a\n",
      "strong passion is upon us is mental. It consists in the difficulty of\n",
      "maintaining an idea, in keeping attention alert and continuous.\n",
      "But at the same time, mere thinking would not lead to action;\n",
      "thinking must be taken up into vital impulse and desire in order\n",
      "to have body and weight in action.\n",
      "From the peculiar union of desire and thought in voluntary\n",

      "requires a theory of the Good: the Good is that which satisfies\n",
      "want, craving, which fulfills or makes complete the need which\n",
      "stirs to action. In its relation to thought, or as an idea of an\n",
      "object to be attained, it imposes upon those about to act the\n",
      "necessity for rational insight, or moral wisdom. For experience shows,\n",
      "as we have seen, that not every satisfaction of appetite and\n",
      "craving turns out to be a good; many ends seem good while we are\n",
      "under the influence of strong passion which in actual experience\n",
      "and in such thought as might have occurred in a cool moment\n",
      "are actually bad. The task of moral theory is thus to frame a\n",
      "theory of Good as the end or objective of desire, and also to frame a\n",
      "theory of the true, as distinct from the specious, good. In effect\n",
      "this latter need signifies the discovery of ends which will meet the\n",
      "demands of impartial and far-sighted thought as well as satisfy\n",
      "the urgencies of desire.\n",
      "This double aspect of ends gives a clew to the consideration of\n",
      "the different theories which have been advanced, and also a\n",
      "criterion for judging their worth. A theory may appear,\n",
      "superficially, to offer a conception of the Good that connects it in a\n",
      "satisfactory way with desire and yet fail to provide the\n",
      "conditions which alone would enable the end to afford intelligent\n",
      "direction to conduct. This is especially true of the first theory\n",
      "which we shall now take up.\n",
      "§ 3. Pleasure as the Good and the End\n",
      "To many minds it has seemed not only plausible but\n",
      "practically self-evident that what makes any object of desire and\n",
      "of attainment good is the pleasure which it gives to the one who\n",
      "has the experience. We find mankind seeking for many and for\n",
      "diverse objects. But why? What is the common quality which\n",
      "renders all these different things desirable? According to the\n",
      "theory under discussion (called Hedonism, from the Greek ἡδονή ,\n",
      "signifying pleasure) this common quality is pleasure. The\n",
      "evidence for the theory is asserted to be found in experience itself.\n",
      "Why does and why should any one seek for any object unless he\n",
      "believes it will be enjoyed? Why should any one avoid any object\n",
      "as evil unless he believes its experience will be painful? The\n",
      "words of Bain and of John Stuart Mill are typical. The former\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",

      "Happiness is the proper end of all human procedures. . . . It is an\n",
      "ultimate or final assumption to be tested by reference to the\n",
      "individual judgments of mankind.\" The latter said: \"The only proof\n",
      "capable of being given that an object is visible is that people\n",

      "But in other words, it signifies that which is fit, proper, as in\n",
      "the words \"enjoyable,\" \"lovable.\" \"Desirable\" signifies not that\n",
      "which is capable of being desired (experience shows that about\n",
      "everything has been desired by some one at some time) but that\n",
      "which in the eye of impartial thought should be desired. It is\n",
      "true, of course, that it would be foolish to set up anything as the\n",
      "end of desire, or as desirable, which is not actually desired or\n",
      "capable of being desired. But it would be equally stupid to assume\n",
      "that what should be desired can be determined by a mere\n",

      "reasonableness of things desired has taken place. So there is a\n",
      "distinction between the enjoyed and the enjoyable.\n",
      "We have then to examine the hedonistic theory both as a\n",
      "theory of desire and as a theory of practical wisdom or prudence in\n",
      "the choice of ends to be pursued. The very idea of an end implies\n",
      "something more or less distant, remote; it implies the need of\n",
      "looking ahead, of judging. The advice which it gives to desire is:\n",
      "Respice finem. Consider how you will come out if you act upon\n",
      "the desire you now feel; count the cost. Calculate consequences\n",
      "over a period of time. Circumspection, prudent estimate of the\n",
      "whole course of consequences set in train, is the precondition of\n",
      "attaining satisfaction or the Good. All folly and stupidity consist\n",

      "guidance for action. Suppose a man has a desire to visit a sick\n",

      "pleasures and pains. Suppose he is especially sensitive to the sight of\n",
      "suffering; suppose a disagreeable difference of opinion on some\n",
      "topic comes up in the course of the interview; suppose some bore\n",
      "turns up during the visit:—consider in short the multitude of\n",
      "accidental features of pleasure and pain which are wholly\n",
      "irrelevant to making a wise judgment as to what should be done. An\n",
      "indefinite number of extraneous circumstances affect the\n",
      "pleasures and pains which follow from an act, and have results which\n",
      "are quite foreign to the intrinsic and foreseeable consequences of\n",
      "the act.\n",
      "We may, however, modify the line of reasoning somewhat, and\n",
      "confine the scope of the theory to pleasures and pains which so\n",
      "intrinsically accompany the nature of an act that they may be\n",
      "calculated. All of us get some pleasure by performing the acts\n",
      "which are congenial to our dispositions; such acts are, by\n",
      "conception, agreeable; they agree with, suit, our own tendencies. An\n",
      "expert in tennis likes to play tennis; an artist likes to paint\n",
      "pictures; a scientific man to investigate; a philosopher to speculate;\n",
      "a benevolent man to do kindly deeds; a brave man seeks out\n",
      "scenes in which endurance and loyalty may be exercised, etc. In\n",
      "such cases, given a certain structure of character and trend of\n",
      "aptitudes, there is an intrinsic basis for foreseeing pleasures and\n",
      "pains, and we may limit the theory to such consequences,\n",
      "excluding purely accidental ones.\n",
      "But in modifying the theory in this way we have really set up the\n",
      "man's existing character as the criterion. A crafty, unscrupulous\n",
      "man, will get pleasure out of his sheer wiliness. When he thinks\n",
      "of an act which would bring pain in the experience of a generous\n",
      "frank person, he will find the thought a source of pleasure, and\n",

      "accord with his present character. Imagine two men who\n",
      "momentarily are taken by the idea of a harsh revenge upon a man\n",
      "who has inflicted ill treatment. For the moment both of them will\n",
      "get at least a passing pleasure from the image of the other man as\n",
      "overthrown and suffering. But the one who is kind-hearted will\n",
      "soon find himself pained at the thought of the harm the other\n",
      "man is experiencing; the cruel and revengeful person will glow\n",
      "with more and more pleasure the longer he dwells upon the\n",
      "distress of his enemy—if pleasure be a sign of goodness, the act will\n",
      "indeed be good to him.\n",
      "There is thus a double misconception in the theory.\n",
      "Unconsciously, it slips in the criterion of the kind of pleasures which\n",
      "would be enjoyed by a man already good; the sort of pleasures\n",
      "which are taken to be normal. Other things being equal,\n",
      "pleasures are certainly a good to be enjoyed, not an evil to be shunned.\n",
      "But the phrase \"other things being equal\" covers a good deal of\n",
      "ground. One does not think of the pleasures of the dissolute, the\n",
      "dishonest, the mean and stingy, person, but of the pleasure of\n",
      "esthetic enjoyment, of friendship and good companionship, of\n",
      "knowledge, and so on. But there is no denying that characters we\n",
      "morally contemn get actual pleasure from their lines of conduct.\n",
      "We may think, and quite properly so, that they ought not to, but\n",
      "nevertheless they do. There are certain kinds of happiness which\n",
      "the good man enjoys which the evil-minded man does not—but\n",
      "the reverse is true. And this fact is fatal to the theory that\n",
      "pleasures constitute the good because of which a given object is\n",
      "entitled to be the end of action.\n",
      "The other misconception consists in confusion of anticipated,\n",
      "prospective pleasure with the enjoyment immediately\n",
      "experienced in the thought of an end. Whenever a future object is\n",
      "thought of as an end, the thought arouses a present pleasure or\n",
      "discomfort. And any present enjoyment or disagreeableness\n",
      "strengthens or weakens the hold of its particular object upon our\n",
      "attention. It intensifies or reduces the moving force of the object\n",
      "thought of. A desire may be inflamed to a practically\n",
      "uncontrollable degree by dwelling upon the pleasures which the\n",
      "imagination of it now excites in me. But this increase of the dynamic\n",

      "foresight of the goodness of the consequences which will ensue if\n",
      "we take that object to be our end. Indeed, in many cases it is\n",
      "positively hostile to sound judgment of future consequences. The\n",
      "most which can be said is that after a man has judged that some\n",
      "end is good to attain, it is a wise act on his part to foster its\n",
      "pleasurable associations. In this way his resolution will be confirmed\n",
      "against distractions. A student who has decided to spend his\n",

      "statement that all good has enjoyment as an ingredient is not\n",
      "equivalent to the statement that all pleasure is a good. The\n",
      "quotation from Hazlitt points out the difference. If we judge, we\n",
      "often find that we cannot approve an enjoyment. This is not\n",
      "because the pleasure is itself evil but because judgment brings to\n",
      "light relations of the pleasure-giving act and object which we\n",
      "shrink from morally, or are ashamed of. An act appeals to us as\n",
      "pleasurable. If we stop to think we may find that the pleasure is\n",
      "due to something in ourselves which we feel to be unworthy, as\n",
      "to a mean or yellow streak. Or when we judge, we approve the\n",
      "enjoyment; not because it is in its isolation a good, but because\n",

      "conditions and the effects with which the pleasure is connected.\n",
      "Things give us pleasure because they are agreeable to (agree with\n",

      "become aware of this connection: thus in the judgment to the\n",
      "moral value of an enjoyment we are really judging our own\n",

      "must include understanding as part of the meaning of\n",

      "are contingent upon all sorts of external circumstances, of which\n",
      "even the most fundamental, the persistence of life itself, is highly\n",
      "precarious. Reflection upon the vicissitudes of life led therefore\n",
      "some observers to regard solicitude for the future as a source of\n",
      "worry and anxiety, rather than as a condition of attaining the\n",
      "good. There is no wisdom in finding good in what is exposed to\n",
      "circumstances beyond our control; such conduct is rather a\n",
      "manifestation of folly. The part of wisdom is then to cultivate the\n",
      "present moment as it passes, to extract from it all the enjoyment\n",
      "which it is capable of yielding. Carpe diem. The idea is poetically\n",
      "expressed in the lines of Edna St. Vincent Millay:\n",
      "I burn my candle at both ends,\n",
      "It will not last the night;\n",
      "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\n",
      "It gives a lovely light—\n",
      "It is grossly expressed in the saying \"Eat, drink and be merry, for\n",
      "tomorrow we die.\"\n",
      "There is nevertheless on this theory great difference between a\n",
      "thoughtless grasping at the pleasures of the moment, and a\n",
      "reflectively regulated procedure. Experience teaches that some\n",
      "enjoyments are extremely fleeting and are also likely to be followed\n",
      "by reactions of discomfort and suffering. Such is the case with all\n",
      "extreme and violent pleasures. Indulgence in intense pleasure\n",
      "rarely pays; it is a liability rather than an asset. For experience\n",
      "shows that such a pleasure usually plunges us into situations that\n",
      "are attended with inconvenience and suffering. Those\n",
      "enjoyments which turn out to be good are calm and equable\n",

      "concerned with external things, and hence commit us to\n",
      "situations we cannot control. Of the delights of the senses, however,\n",
      "those of the eye and ear are better worth cultivating than those\n",
      "of taste and smell. For the former are more closely associated\n",
      "with intellectual pleasures, and also with conditions more\n",
      "common, more widely spread, in nature. Enjoyment of sunlight,\n",

      "This theory constitutes Epicureanism in its original form—a\n",
      "doctrine far removed from that surrender to voluptuous\n",
      "pleasures often associated with the name. Its maxim is to cherish\n",
      "those elements of enjoyment in the present which are most\n",
      "assured, and to avoid entanglement in external circumstances. This\n",
      "emphasis upon the conditions of security of present enjoyment is\n",

      "The theory avoids the difficulties about foresight and\n",
      "calculation of future pleasures and pains which nullify the type of\n",
      "theory previously considered. It is a matter of experience,\n",
      "personal and social, that gentle and equable enjoyment is safer and\n",
      "more lasting than the vehement gratifications of excessive\n",
      "excitement. The person cultivated in books, intellectual pursuits, apt in\n",
      "friendly companionship, has sources of satisfaction more wholly\n",
      "within himself than has the person given to sensual pleasures or\n",
      "to the pursuit of money and fame. There is obviously sound\n",
      "sense in the maxim as far as it goes. The lesson is particularly\n",
      "needed in periods of bustle, hurry, and luxury, when men are\n",
      "carried away by interest in external and passing things, preoccupied\n",
      "with the material consequences of machinery and business and\n",

      "On the other hand, the doctrine is fundamentally one of\n",
      "withdrawal and restriction, even if it take the form of a high\n",
      "intellectual \"disinterestedness,\" aloof from the ado and melee of\n",
      "practical affairs. If it were possible to isolate the present from the\n",

      "could be found. But the quality of selfish engrossment in one's\n",
      "own enjoyment which seems to cling to the doctrine is a\n",
      "necessary product of the attempt to exclude concern for the future.\n",
      "The doctrine is, ultimately, one of seclusion and passivity. It not\n",

      "of men are perforce engaged. It is a doctrine which can appeal\n",
      "only to those who are already advantageously situated. It\n",
      "presupposes that there are others who are doing the hard, rough\n",

      "§ 5. Success as the End\n",
      "A third variant of the theory that the chief moral\n",
      "demand is for wisdom in choice of ends is the doctrine of\n",
      "\"success,\" understood in the sense of enlightened self-interest. This\n",
      "theory is not committed to any particular doctrine about\n",
      "pleasures and pains, and has rarely been formulated with the\n",
      "intellectual precision of the other principles. But it is widely acted upon\n",
      "in practice. It is hinted at in the saying that \"honesty is the best\n",

      "business, politics, administration, wherever achievement and\n",
      "failure can be measured in terms of external power, repute,\n",
      "making money, and attainment of social status. The doctrine puts a\n",
      "high estimate on efficiency, on getting things done; it admires\n",
      "thrift, shrewdness, industriousness, and condemns laziness and\n",
      "stupidity. It is suspicious of art, save as an embellishment of\n",
      "practical success, and is distrustful of distinctively intellectual\n",
      "pursuits save when they bear tangible practical fruit.\n",
      "In spite of the fact that moralists generally take a disparaging\n",
      "attitude toward this view of life, there is something to be said for\n",

      "do not seem to rank very high as motives. But when one\n",
      "considers the amount of harm done by sheer ignorance, folly,\n",
      "carelessness, by surrender to momentary whim and impulse, one\n",
      "may safely conclude that the state of things would be better than\n",

      "itself upon being moral has been content with mere \"meaning\n",
      "well,\" with good intentions (which according to the saying help\n",
      "to \"pave hell\"), that are devoid of energy in action and efficiency\n",
      "in execution, one cannot withhold a modicum of respect for a\n",

      "prudence, interpreted to signify expediency in respect to\n",
      "achievement, at least tends to hold men to their work, and to protect\n",
      "them from distraction and waste of time and energy.\n",
      "When all allowances are made, however, the defects of the\n",

      "of success in the general sense of achievement is a necessary part\n",

      "superficial, conventional, and unexamined conception of what\n",
      "constitutes achievement. It pins its faith to certain values at the\n",
      "expense of others more human and more significant. Morality\n",
      "must be \"worldly\" enough to take account of the fact that we\n",

      "minded way.\n",

      "Another interpretation of the nature of wisdom in the\n",
      "formation of ends and judgment of the good was put forth in\n",
      "Greece by the Cynic school. As we have seen the great problem\n",
      "concerning ends is to discriminate between those which are\n",
      "\"good\" in a near-by and partial view, and those which are\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "enduringly and inclusively good. The former are more obvious; the\n",
      "latter depend upon the exercise of reflection and often can be\n",
      "discovered and sustained in thought only by reflection which is\n",
      "patient and thorough. Even so, it is notorious that things which\n",
      "are simply judged to be good are pallid and without power to\n",
      "move us compared with warmer and nearer goods which make a\n",
      "direct appeal to those impulses and desires that are already\n",
      "urgent. Hence, the Cynic school thought it the part of moral\n",
      "wisdom to treat practical exercises which form stable habits as\n",
      "the important thing. Artisans and craftsmen are skilful and\n",
      "persistent in pursuit of aims not in virtue of reflection and theory,\n",
      "but because of habits formed by exercise. Why not carry the\n",
      "principle over into morals generally? The great thing is to attain\n",
      "command over immediate appetite and desire. Thinking is\n",
      "comparatively impotent in giving this command; trained habit is\n",
      "potent. The moral maxim is then to practice the right act till habit\n",
      "is firm.\n",
      "In the precise form in which the theory was advanced by the\n",
      "Cynic school it has not had great influence. But the underlying\n",
      "conception that wisdom consists in subjection and discipline of\n",
      "desire, and that this subordination is obtained by deliberate\n",
      "exercise rather than by reflection, has become an important part of\n",
      "all those moral ideas which have a Puritanical color. In the\n",
      "extreme form, the principle is called Asceticism (from the Greek,\n",
      "(ἄσκησις , exercise, discipline). Popularly, the view is presumed\n",
      "to be opposed to the very idea of happiness and satisfaction. It\n",
      "does look with suspicion upon all ordinary forms of gratification\n",
      "as morally dangerous. But it does so in the interest of a final\n",
      "satisfaction of a different type—as a martyr endures suffering in\n",
      "this world in the hope of eternal happiness in another world, or\n",
      "if not that, then because of the satisfaction he obtains through\n",

      "they mislead judgment and action. Their deceptive quality is\n",
      "what stands between us and the wisdom that lays hold of the\n",
      "true good. The pleasures of ordinary desire are so strong that the\n",
      "latter have to be subdued if we are to be loyal to real satisfaction.\n",
      "The way to subdue them is to engage systematically in exercises\n",
      "which are naturally uncongenial; then we harden ourselves to\n",

      "We have seen that the idea of Ends and the Good is the\n",
      "counterpart of the intellectual aspect of character and conduct.\n",
      "The difficulty in the way of attaining and maintaining practical\n",
      "wisdom is the urgency of immediate impulse and desire which\n",
      "swell and swell until they crowd out all thought of remote and\n",
      "comprehensive goods. The conflict is a real one and is at the\n",
      "heart of many of our serious moral struggles and lapses. In the\n",
      "main, solution is found in utilizing all possible occasions, when\n",
      "we are not in the presence of conflicting desires, to cultivate\n",
      "interest in those goods which we do approve in our calm moments\n",
      "of reflection. John Stuart Mill remarked that \"the cultivated\n",
      "mind . . . finds sources of inexhaustible interest in all that\n",
      "surrounds it; in the objects of nature, the achievements of art, the\n",
      "imaginations of poetry, the incidents of history, the ways of\n",
      "mankind, past, present and their prospects in the future.\" There are\n",
      "many times when the cultivation of these interests meets with no\n",
      "strong obstacle. The habits which are built up and reenforced\n",
      "under such conditions are the best bulwarks against weakness\n",
      "and surrender in the moments when the reflective or \"true\" good\n",
      "conflicts with that set up by temporary and intense desire. The\n",
      "proper course of action is, then, to multiply occasions for the\n",
      "enjoyment of these ends, to prolong and deepen the experiences\n",
      "connected with them. Morality then becomes positive instead of\n",
      "a struggle carried against the seductive force of lesser goods.\n",
      "This course of action gives no guarantee against occurrence of\n",
      "situations of conflict and of possible failure to maintain the\n",
      "greater good. But reflective attachment to the ends which reason\n",
      "presents is enormously increased when these ends have\n",
      "themselves been, on earlier occasions, natural goods enjoyed in the\n",
      "normal course of life. Ideal ends, those sustained by thought, do\n",
      "not lose their ideal character when they are directly appreciated;\n",
      "in the degree in which they become objects of positive interest\n",
      "their power to control and move conduct in times of stress is\n",
      "reenforced.\n",
      "This fact brings out the common element found in the\n",

      "truth hinted at in the hedonistic view of moral wisdom, (that it\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "consists in foresight and calculation of future enjoyments and\n",
      "sufferings) is that present enjoyment may accompany the thought\n",
      "of remote objects when they are held before the mind. Its error\n",
      "lies in supposing that in reflection our ideas go out to future\n",
      "pleasures instead of to future objects. A man in order to cultivate\n",
      "good health does not think of the pleasures it will bring to him:\n",
      "in thinking of the various objects and acts which will follow from\n",
      "good health he experiences a present enjoyment, and this\n",
      "enjoyment strengthens his effort to attain it. As Plato and Aristotle said\n",
      "over two thousand years ago, the aim of moral education is to\n",
      "develop a character which finds pleasure in right objects and\n",
      "pain in wrong ends.\n",
      "Something similar is to be said of wisdom or prudence viewed\n",
      "as a judgment of ends which are expedient or that mark \"good\n",
      "policy.\" As far as the maxim emphasizes means and conditions\n",
      "that are necessary to achievement, thus taking morals out of the\n",
      "region of sentimental vaporing and fantasies, miscalled idealism,\n",
      "the principle is sound. Error lies in restriction of the domains of\n",
      "value in which achievement is desirable. It is folly rather than\n",
      "wisdom to include in the concept of success only tangible\n",
      "material goods and to exclude those of culture, art, science,\n",
      "sympathetic relations with others. Once a man has experienced certain\n",
      "kinds of good in a concrete and intimate way, he would rather\n",
      "fail in external achievement than forego striving for them. The\n",
      "zest of endeavor is itself an enjoyment to be fostered, and life is\n",
      "poor without it. As John Stuart Mill said \"some things called\n",
      "expedient are not useful but in reality are one branch of the\n",
      "harmful.\" To due reflection, things sometimes regarded as\n",
      "\"practical\" are in truth highly impolitic and shortsighted. But the way\n",
      "to eliminate preference for narrow and shortsighted expediences\n",
      "is not to condemn the practical as low and mercenary in\n",
      "comparison with spiritual ideals, but to cultivate all possible\n",
      "opportunities for the actual enjoyment of the reflective values and to\n",
      "engage in the activity, the practice, which extends their scope.\n",
      "The morally wise, accordingly, appreciate the necessity of\n",
      "doing, of \"exercise.\" They realize the importance of habit as a\n",
      "protection against beguilement by the goods proposed by immediate\n",
      "desire and urgent passion. But they also apprehend that\n",
      "abstinence for the sake of abstinence, mortification of the flesh for the\n",
      "sake of mortification, is not a rational end. The important ally to\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "doing is sense of power, and this sense of power is the\n",
      "accompaniment of progress in actual achievement of a positive good.\n",
      "Next, if not equal in importance (in some temperaments,\n",
      "superior), is the esthetic factor. A golfer or tennis player may enjoy\n",
      "his exercises because he appreciates the value of \"form.\" Emerson\n",
      "speaks of the elegance of abstinence. Moderation is the associate\n",
      "of proportion, and there is no art without measure. The restraint\n",
      "that ensues from a sense of the fitness of proportion is very\n",
      "different in quality from that which is exercised for its own sake. To\n",
      "find excess disgusting is more efficacious than finding it wrong\n",
      "although attractive.\n",
      "Finally, the underlying truth of what is called Epicureanism\n",
      "contains an element upon which we have insisted: the\n",
      "importance of nurturing the present enjoyment of things worth while,\n",
      "instead of sacrificing present value to an unknown and\n",
      "uncertain future. If this course is popularly thought of as mere self-\n",
      "indulgence, as selfish and destructive of consecutive striving for\n",
      "remote ends, it is because emphasis is laid upon the bare fact of\n",
      "enjoyment instead of upon the values enjoyed. Here as with the\n",
      "other principles discussed, the conclusion is the need of fostering\n",
      "at every opportunity direct enjoyment of the kind of goods\n",
      "reflection approves. To deny direct satisfaction any place in morals\n",
      "is simply to weaken the moving force of the goods approved by\n",
      "thought.\n",
      "Our discussion has centered on the goods which approve\n",
      "themselves to the thoughtful, or morally \"wise,\" person in their\n",
      "relation to the satisfactions which suggest themselves because of\n",
      "immediate and intense desire, impulse, and appetite. The office\n",
      "of reflection we have seen to be the formation of a judgment of\n",
      "value in which particular satisfactions are placed as integral\n",
      "parts of conduct as a consistent harmonious whole. If values did\n",
      "not get in one another's way, if, that is, the realization of one\n",
      "desire were not incompatible with that of another, there would be\n",
      "no need of reflection. We should grasp and enjoy each thing as it\n",
      "comes along. Wisdom, or as it is called on the ordinary plane,\n",
      "prudence, sound judgment, is the ability to foresee consequences\n",
      "in such a way that we form ends which grow into one another\n",
      "and reenforce one another. Moral folly is the surrender of the\n",
      "greater good for the lesser; it is snatching at one satisfaction in a\n",

      "Up to this point we have passed over the social conditions\n",
      "which affect the development of wise and prudent attitudes of\n",

      "much the formal schooling as the influence of the traditions and\n",
      "institutions of the community in which one lives, and the habits\n",
      "of one's associates, are a profound influence. The simplest\n",
      "illustration is that of a spoiled child. The person who is encouraged\n",
      "to yield to every desire as it arises, the one who receives\n",
      "constantly the help of others in getting what he wants when he\n",
      "wants it, will have to possess extraordinary intellectual powers if\n",
      "he develops a habit of reflective valuation. What is true on this\n",
      "personal scale is true on a wide social scale. The general social\n",
      "order may be such as to put a premium upon the kind of\n",
      "satisfaction which is coarse, gross, \"materialistic,\" and upon attitudes\n",
      "which are in impatient haste to grab any seeming near-by good.\n",
      "This state of affairs is characteristic of many phases of American\n",
      "life today. Love of power over others, of display and luxury, of\n",
      "pecuniary wealth, is fostered by our economic régime. Goods\n",
      "that are more ideal, esthetic, intellectual values, those of\n",
      "friendship which is more than a superficial comradeship, are forced\n",
      "into subordination. The need of fostering the reflective and\n",

      "all, there is the need to remake social conditions so that they will\n",
      "almost automatically support fuller and more enduring values\n",
      "and will reduce those social habits which favor the free play of\n",
      "impulse unordered by thought, or which make men satisfied to\n",

      "§ 2. The Origin of Moral Claims\n",
      "Can we find a place for the moral authority of the\n",
      "demands to which we are subject, a place which is distinct, on the\n",
      "one hand, from mere coercion, from physical and mental\n",
      "pressure, and which, on the other hand, does not set up a law of duty\n",
      "and right that has nothing to do with the natural desires and\n",
      "tendencies of our human constitution? Such is the problem that\n",
      "confronts us. For, on the one hand, mere compulsion has no\n",
      "moral standing. Persons may and do yield to the demands of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "arbitrary force simply because they will suffer if they do not. But\n",
      "such yielding develops a slavish weakness in them and an\n",
      "arrogant disregard of the rights of others in those who have power.\n",
      "On the other hand, we split man into two disconnected parts if\n",
      "we say that there is a law and principle of Duty which has\n",
      "nothing to do with our normal impulses and purposes and which\n",
      "yet is supreme over them.\n",
      "The way out is found by recognizing that the exercise of claims\n",
      "is as natural as anything else in a world in which persons are not\n",
      "isolated from one another but live in constant association and\n",
      "interaction. A child may be subject to demands from a parent\n",
      "which express nothing but the arbitrary wish of the latter, plus a\n",
      "power to make the child suffer if he does not conform. But the\n",
      "claims and demands to which the child is subject need not\n",
      "proceed from arbitrary will; they may issue from the very nature of\n",
      "family life in the relation which exists between parent and\n",
      "offspring. Then they do not come to the child as an external and\n",
      "despotic power, but as expressions of a whole to which he\n",
      "himself belongs. He is moved to respond by his affection for his\n",
      "parents, by his respect for their judgment; even when the demand\n",
      "runs contrary to his uppermost desire he still responds to it as to\n",
      "something not wholly alien. Because of inherent relationships\n",
      "persons sustain to one another, they are exposed to the\n",
      "expectations of others and to the demands in which these expectations\n",
      "are made manifest.\n",
      "The case is perhaps even clearer if we consider the parent as\n",
      "one who is also subject to claims. These need not be voiced in\n",
      "explicit form by the child; they do not proceed consciously from\n",
      "him. But the parent who is conscientious feels that they are\n",

      "because of the very nature of the friendly relation. Citizens in a\n",
      "just state respond at their personal inconvenience to the demands\n",
      "of the state, not because the latter may bring physical pressure or\n",
      "mental coercion to bear upon them, but because they are\n",
      "members of organized society: members in such an intimate sense\n",

      "may be extremely irksome. But we should not hesitate to say that\n",
      "one who refused to meet them merely because they were\n",
      "troublesome was no true friend. If we generalize such instances, we\n",
      "reach the conclusion that Right, law, duty, arise from the\n",
      "relations which human beings intimately sustain to one another, and\n",
      "that their authoritative force springs from the very nature of the\n",
      "relation that binds people together.\n",
      "This conclusion will be strengthened if we consider in some\n",
      "detail the theories which explain moral authority and\n",
      "rightfulness on other grounds. Some of these conceptions make the\n",
      "will of God the locus of authority; others (like that of Thomas\n",
      "Hobbes) transfer it from God to the political State; Kant, in\n",
      "reaction against any external source, found it in a law of practical\n",
      "reason resident in man but having an entirely different origin\n",
      "and constitution from his impulses and affections. A popular\n",
      "version of the same underlying idea is that man has a double\n",
      "nature, being both spiritual and carnal, and that the flesh is\n",
      "rightfully subject to the law of the spirit. From the standpoint of\n",
      "history, it is worth noting that while the Greeks developed the\n",
      "idea of the Good and of moral insight, it was the Romans, with\n",
      "their strong legal and administrative talents, who made central\n",
      "the idea of authorization by law. The three maxims in which\n",
      "Roman moralists and jurists summed up the moral code all take the\n",
      "form of duties. Render to every other man that which is his due.\n",
      "So use what is your own as not to injure others. Vivere\n",
      "honestum: that is, live so as to deserve good repute from others.\n",
      "These maxims were said to be the essentials of the \"law of\n",
      "nature,\" from accord with which the rightfulness of human\n",
      "institutions and laws is derived.\n",
      "§ 3. The Kantian Theory\n",
      "Undoubtedly the most logically extreme formulation of\n",
      "the belief that authority and law come first, and that the\n",
      "conception of the good, in a moral sense, is secondary, is that of Kant.\n",
      "The subordination of Good to the Right is summed up in the\n",
      "words \"the concept of good and evil must not be determined\n",
      "before the moral law, but only after it and by means of it.\" Nor\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "does Kant stop here. He carries to its logical extreme that notion\n",
      "of the opposition between all the values which satisfy desires and\n",
      "the true moral good referred to in the previous chapter (p. 186).\n",
      "He accepts the hedonistic psychology with respect to desires.\n",
      "From the standpoint of desire, all good is a pleasure which is\n",
      "personal and private. The man who allows desires, even those of\n",
      "affection for others, to direct his conduct is, in final account, only\n",
      "seeking his own good, that is, his own pleasure. The ruling\n",
      "principle of all desires is Self-love, a development of the instinct for\n",
      "self-preservation which according to him governs all appetite\n",
      "and impulse. Thus the moral good is not only different from the\n",
      "natural goods which man experiences in the regular course of\n",
      "living but is opposed to them. The essence of the moral struggle is\n",
      "to put regard for moral law in the place of desire for satisfaction\n",
      "as the dominant maxim and motive of conduct. Morality is a\n",
      "struggle just because men in their native make-up and capacity\n",
      "naturally seek to satisfy their desires, while their higher nature\n",
      "imposes a complete check on this tendency.\n",
      "Kant expressed the idea of the supreme authority of the\n",
      "concepts of law and duty so logically that his views are worthy of\n",
      "particular attention by means of a few examples. Natural impulse\n",
      "suggests to a mother care of her infant; but to be morally good,\n",
      "the motive of her conduct must be reverence for the moral law\n",
      "which makes it her bounden duty to care for the child. The view\n",
      "has been caricatured by saying that to be truly moral, the mother\n",
      "must suppress her natural affection. This extreme result is not\n",
      "implied. But it is no caricature to say that, according to Kant, the\n",
      "parent must suppress the tendency of natural affection to\n",
      "become the motive for performance of acts of attention to\n",
      "offspring. She must bring, as far as the moving spring of her actions\n",
      "is concerned, her affection under a deliberate appreciation of the\n",
      "obligatory nature of what she does. Her act is not morally good\n",
      "because it flows from affection, nor because it promotes the\n",
      "welfare of the young as its consequence. Again, a man engaged in\n",
      "service of a client is moved either by ambition for professional\n",
      "success or by acquired professional habits to do the best he can\n",
      "for the affairs of clients entrusted to his charge. But his acts are\n",
      "morally good—are right as distinct from satisfactory—only\n",
      "when such motives as affect his conduct, including even the wish\n",
      "to be of service to others, are subordinated to reverence for the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "moral law. Again, a merchant may supply customers with proper\n",
      "commodities, give honest change, serve them zealously, just\n",
      "because he thinks it good policy. He is only looking out for number\n",
      "one, while he ought to be doing what he does because it is a\n",
      "moral duty to act in that way.\n",
      "One aspect of Kant's theory has been incidentally touched\n",
      "upon before (p. 173); namely, the contrast which is set up\n",
      "between will, defined as motive, and consequences; together with\n",
      "the attribution of moral goodness to the former alone. We shall\n",
      "here confine ourselves accordingly to that one element which is\n",
      "peculiar to his position; namely, the conception of reverence for\n",
      "law and duty as the only justifying motive. The law according to\n",
      "Kant is imperative; and the imperative command is absolute,\n",
      "unconditioned—the \"categorical imperative,\" he calls it, in order\n",
      "to distinguish it from requirements of prudence and skill which\n",
      "are only hypothetical. The latter take the form: If you wish good\n",
      "health, or success in your calling, you must do so and so. The\n",
      "moral command says, You must act from the motive of duty,\n",
      "anyway. The extreme and logical form in which Kant states the\n",
      "principle of Right as distinct from the Good, of Law and Duty,\n",
      "brings out the difficulty in all theories which separate the right\n",
      "entirely from satisfaction of desires and affections. Ignoring\n",
      "technicalities in the Kantian theory, the difficulty is this: When\n",
      "all regard for consequences and for all ends which desire sets\n",
      "before us is excluded, what concrete material is left to be included\n",
      "within the idea of duty? Why may not a man go ahead in any line\n",
      "of conduct provided he is persuaded that his duty lies there?\n",
      "What saves him from self-deceit, from fanaticism, from cruel\n",
      "disregard of the interest of others, once he decides, apart from\n",
      "consideration of consequences, that something is his duty and is\n",
      "commanded by the moral law? Putting the question in its precise\n",
      "form, how shall a man go from the idea of duty in general to that\n",
      "of some particular act or mode of conduct as dutiful?\n",
      "Kant recognizes the difficulty, and fancies he has an adequate\n",
      "answer to it. He does not blink the fact that the idea of Duty in\n",
      "general is without any particular content of its own. We are not\n",
      "aware, according to him, that any particular act is obligatory;\n",
      "we are only aware that it is our imperative duty to make the law\n",
      "of duty supreme in conduct. In itself this law of Duty is, he\n",
      "claims rather than merely admits, formal and empty. For all\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "particular ends have to do with consequences and are linked up with\n",
      "desires. Where then is there any road from Duty in general to the\n",
      "knowledge that it is our duty to pursue some actual concrete end?\n",
      "His answer takes the following form: The consciousness of\n",
      "duty is imposed upon us by our moral reason. We are not mere\n",
      "creatures of appetite and desire, of sense and nature, but there is\n",
      "within us a rational faculty which rises above desire and nature.\n",
      "It is the essence of Reason to express itself in universal and\n",
      "necessary terms. This trait implies that it is wholly self-consistent or\n",
      "universal. It does not say one thing at one time and another at\n",
      "another time; it does not vary with circumstances. So all that is\n",
      "required to know our duty in a particular case is to ask ourselves\n",
      "if the motive of that act can be made universal without falling\n",
      "into self-contradiction. For example:\n",
      "May I, when in distress, make a promise with the intention\n",
      "not to keep it? . . . The shortest way, and an unerring one to\n",
      "discover the answer to the question whether a lying promise\n",
      "is consistent with duty, is to ask myself, Should I be content\n",
      "that my maxim (to extricate myself from trouble by a false\n",
      "promise) should hold good as a universal law, for myself as\n",
      "well as for others? And should I be able to say to myself,\n",
      "every one may make a deceitful promise when he finds\n",
      "himself in a difficulty from which he cannot otherwise extricate\n",
      "himself? Then I personally become aware that while I can\n",
      "will the lie, I can by no means will that lying should be a\n",
      "universal law. For with such a law there would be no such\n",
      "thing as a promise. No one should have any faith in the\n",
      "proffered intention, or, if they do so over-hastily, would pay one\n",
      "back in one's own coin at the first opportunity.\n",
      "The principle if made universal simply contradicts itself, and\n",
      "thus reveals that it is no principle at all, not rational. Summing\n",
      "this up in a formula, we get as our standard of right action the\n",
      "principle: \"Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by\n",
      "thy will a universal law of nature.\"\n",
      "It is not easy to do justice to Kant's formula without going into\n",
      "a consideration of the place which \"Reason\" occupies in his\n",
      "whole system. But it can be pointed out that in passing from the\n",
      "general and formal command of Reason over to judgment on\n",
      "the rightfulness or dutifulness of the particular case, there is an\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "unconscious and yet complete shift in the conception of the work\n",
      "of reason. It is perfectly true that if a person considers the\n",
      "purpose or motive of his act in isolation, as if it were not a member\n",
      "of Conduct as a linked series of actions (p. 169), there is no\n",
      "rationality or reasonableness in his act. There is no principle or law\n",
      "because there is nothing which binds different acts together.\n",
      "Each act is a complete law unto itself, which is the same as no\n",
      "law at all. It is the part of reason to lead us to judge: Would I be\n",
      "willing to act for this end always and under all circumstances?\n",
      "Would I be willing to have others treat me according to it under\n",
      "similar circumstances? In Kant's language: Am I willing to have\n",
      "it made \"universal,\" or am I seeking some special exception for\n",
      "myself under particular circumstances?\n",
      "But this method instead of excluding all reference to\n",
      "consequences is but a way of securing impartial and general\n",
      "consideration of consequences. It does not say: Ignore consequences and\n",
      "do your duty because moral law, through the voice of reason,\n",
      "commands it. It says: Consider as widely as possible the\n",
      "consequences of acting in this way; imagine the results if you and\n",
      "others always acted upon such a purpose as you are tempted to\n",
      "make your end, and see whether you would then be willing to\n",
      "stand by it. If you proceed in this manner, you will get light upon\n",
      "the real character of your particular purpose at the moment. You\n",
      "will be aided in finding where your duty lies. And if a man\n",
      "discovers upon reflection that he would not like to be \"paid back in\n",
      "his own coin,\" in as far as he is fair-minded (and in popular\n",
      "usage, fair-mindedness and rationality of judgment are\n",
      "synonymous terms) he will perceive the wrongness of his proposed act.\n",
      "That in reality, although not in formal theory, Kant's\n",
      "universality signifies regard for social consequences instead of\n",
      "disregard of all consequences appears in another formula of the\n",
      "moral law which he sets forth. According to his view, the moral\n",
      "or rational will is an end in itself, not a means to something else.\n",
      "Now every person is equally an end in himself. Indeed, this is the\n",
      "very quality which marks off a person from a mere thing. Things\n",
      "we use as means; we subordinate physical objects and energies to\n",
      "our own special purposes; stones, timber, heat, electricity. But\n",
      "when we make another person a means to our ends, we violate\n",

      "form: \"So act as to treat humanity, whether in thine own person\n",
      "or in that of any other, as an end, never as a means only.\" The\n",
      "person who makes a lying promise to another uses that other\n",
      "person as a means to his own profit. The man who proposes suicide\n",

      "and final principle: Since all human beings are equally persons\n",
      "and of equal claim upon the conduct of all, the ideal of rational\n",
      "conduct in observance of duty leads to the idea of a kingdom of\n",

      "enough to get his own way, while so covering up his tracks that\n",
      "he seems loyal to constituted authority.\n",
      "The same point comes out when the situation is viewed in\n",
      "reverse. A shrewd observer of political life remarked that power is\n",
      "poison. It is difficult for a person in a place of authoritative\n",
      "power to avoid supposing that what he wants is right as long as\n",
      "he has power to enforce his demand. And even with the best will\n",
      "in the world, he is likely to be isolated from the real needs of\n",
      "others, and the perils of ignorance are added to those of\n",
      "selfishness. History reveals the tendency to confusion of private\n",
      "privilege with official status. The history of the struggle for\n",
      "political liberty is largely a record of attempt to get free from\n",

      "Individuals are interdependent. No one is born except in\n",
      "dependence on others. Without aid and nurture from others, he\n",
      "would miserably perish. The material of his intellectual\n",
      "subsistence, as well as of his physical, comes to him from others. As he\n",
      "matures, he becomes more physically and economically\n",
      "independent; but he can carry on his calling only through cooperation\n",
      "and competition with others; he has needs which are satisfied\n",
      "only through exchange of services and commodities. His\n",
      "recreations as well as his achievements are dependent upon sharing\n",
      "with others. The idea that individuals are born separate and\n",
      "isolated and are brought into society only through some artificial\n",
      "device is a pure myth. Social ties and connections are as natural\n",
      "and inevitable as are physical. Even when a person is alone he\n",
      "thinks with language that is derived from association with\n",
      "others, and thinks about questions and issues that have been born in\n",
      "intercourse. Independence of character and judgment is to be\n",
      "prized. But it is an independence which does not signify\n",
      "separateness; it is something displayed in relation to others. There is\n",
      "no one, for example, of whom independent inquiry, reflection,\n",
      "and insight are more characteristic than the genuine scientific\n",
      "and philosophic thinker. But his independence is a futile\n",
      "eccentricity unless he thinks upon problems which have originated in\n",
      "a long tradition, and unless he intends to share his conclusions\n",
      "with others, so as to win their assent or elicit their corrections.\n",
      "Such facts are familiar and commonplace. Their meaning is not\n",
      "always so definitely recognized:—namely, that the human being\n",
      "is an individual because of and in relations with others.\n",
      "Otherwise, he is an individual only as a stick of wood is, namely, as\n",
      "spatially and numerically separate.\n",
      "Many of these relations are enduring, or recur frequently. The\n",
      "relation of child and parent, for example, lasts for a number of\n",
      "years, giving rise to claims for protection and nurture, and for\n",
      "attention, respect, and affection. The duties which express these\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "relations are intrinsic to the situation, not enforced from\n",
      "without. The one who becomes a parent assumes by that very fact\n",
      "certain responsibilities. Even if he feels these to be a burden and\n",
      "seeks to escape from them, he flees from something which is part\n",
      "of himself and not from something imposed by external force.\n",
      "Many of the duties recognized in our system of common law\n",
      "arose out of relations which recur pretty constantly in the\n",
      "economic relations of men, as, for example, those of landlord and\n",
      "tenant, vendor and purchaser, master and servant, trustee and\n",
      "beneficiary. It does not follow from this fact that the duties\n",
      "expressing the relation have always been just what they should\n",
      "be; the relation may have been one-sided rather than reciprocal.\n",
      "But the remedy lies not in the abolition of all duties but in a\n",
      "change in the character of the relationship.\n",
      "While particular rights and duties may, then, be arbitrary\n",
      "there is nothing arbitrary or forced in the existence of right and\n",
      "obligation. The Romans spoke of duties as offices. An office is a\n",
      "function which has a representative value; that is, it stands for\n",
      "something beyond itself. It is as a parent, not just as an isolated\n",
      "individual, that a man or woman imposes obligations on\n",
      "children; these grow out of the office or function the parent sustains,\n",
      "not out of mere personal will. When they express merely one will\n",
      "in opposition to another, instead of proceeding from the tie\n",
      "which binds persons together, they violate their own basis. In the\n",
      "case of those persons who are usually called officers the point is\n",
      "even clearer. The legislator, judge, assessor, sheriff, does not\n",
      "exercise authority as his private possession, but as the\n",
      "representative of relations in which many share. He is an organ of a\n",
      "community of interests and purposes. In principle, therefore, Right\n",
      "expresses the way in which the good of a number of persons,\n",
      "held together by intrinsic ties, becomes efficacious in the\n",
      "regulation of the members of a community.\n",
      "The fact that the idea or principle of Right has such a natural\n",
      "basis and inevitable role does not, however, signify that it will\n",
      "not conflict with what an individual judges to be his good and\n",
      "his end, nor does it guarantee the rightfulness of all claims and\n",
      "demands that are put forth in its name. On the contrary, one\n",
      "may use the power and prestige which a representative capacity\n",
      "confers to advance one's personal interests, add to one's\n",
      "individual enjoyments, and enhance one's private gains. A parent may\n",

      "degrade the parental office into a means of increasing his own\n",
      "comfort and displaying his own whims, satisfying his love of\n",
      "power over others. And so with civic and political officials. Such\n",
      "conduct is faithlessness, but such betrayal is unfortunately a\n",
      "common event. The evil extends; it provokes resentment against\n",
      "all authority, and the feeling grows that all duties are limitations\n",
      "of personal freedom and arbitrary impositions of superior power.\n",
      "The conflict affects the interpretation of the meaning of law.\n",
      "On one hand, it is regarded as the expression of a superior will in\n",
      "reference to the wills of those whose wills are inferior and\n",
      "subject. On the other hand, it is erected into an impersonal and\n",
      "independent entity, above all human wills. Kant virtually defined\n",
      "the moral law in this fashion, although he did so in the professed\n",
      "name of a rational will. Undoubtedly the tendency to treat law as\n",
      "something in itself, over and above of all human relations instead\n",
      "of as an expression of the end and good which these relations\n",
      "should serve, has arisen in part at least because of a feeling that\n",
      "human relations fluctuate, and from the desire to find something\n",
      "stable and constant. This motive is implicit when the \"majesty\"\n",
      "and \"sublimity\" of law are spoken of. But the logical\n",
      "consequence and the practical effect, if the belief is acted upon, is to\n",
      "render morals harsh, because of neglect of the relation between\n",
      "law and obligation and the attainment of Good. It subjects the\n",
      "mass of men to the desires of those who have it in their power to\n",
      "declare and enforce what they take to be law.\n",
      "The outcome of the discussion is that while Right in general\n",
      "has an independent status because of the social claims which\n",
      "attend human relations, any particular claim is open to\n",
      "examination and criticism. Is it entitled to claim the authority of right for\n",
      "itself? Is it truly rightful? To answer such questions and to guide\n",
      "judgment in criticism a criterion for the rightfulness of\n",
      "particular laws and obligations has to be found. The essence of the\n",
      "claim which Right puts forth is that even if the thing exacted\n",
      "does not appeal as his good to the one to whom it is addressed,\n",
      "he should voluntarily take it to be a good; that, in short, it\n",
      "should become his good, even if he does not so judge it at the time.\n",
      "This element of the \"should\" or \"ought\" is what differentiates\n",
      "the idea of Right from that of Good. But it does not cut the idea\n",
      "wholly loose from that of Good, for what \"should be\" is that an\n",
      "individual should find the required conduct good. The solution\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "of the apparent contradiction between that which is not now\n",
      "judged good and yet should be judged good points the way to the\n",
      "criterion of which we are in search. Does the conduct alleged to\n",
      "be obligatory, alleged to have the authority of moral law behind\n",
      "it, actually contribute to a good in which the one from whom an\n",
      "act is demanded will share? The person upon whom the duty is\n",
      "laid himself makes claims upon others; he expects benefits from\n",
      "others; he holds others to the duties which they owe him,\n",
      "because of his ends and the values which he seeks to obtain. If the\n",
      "claim is, then, of the kind which he himself puts forth, if it serves\n",
      "a good which he prizes for himself, he must, in the degree in\n",
      "which he is fair-minded, acknowledge it to be a common good,\n",
      "and hence binding upon his judgment and action.\n",
      "The point comes out perhaps most clearly if we ask what it is\n",
      "which makes an act wrong. Our theory commits us to the\n",
      "conclusion that a choice and deed are not wrong merely because\n",
      "they fail to conform with current laws and the customary code\n",
      "of duties. For these may be wrong, and an individual may have\n",
      "Right on his side in refusal to conform. Some persons persecuted\n",
      "as moral rebels in one period have been hailed as moral heroes at\n",
      "a later time; children build monuments to those whom their\n",
      "fathers stoned. Yet this fact does not commit us to the conclusion\n",
      "that there is no criterion of right and wrong except that personal\n",
      "subjective opinion sometimes improperly called private\n",
      "conscience. A man would not steal if there were no value placed by\n",
      "him on property; even a thief resents having what he has stolen\n",
      "taken from him. If there were no such thing as good faith, there\n",
      "could be no fraud. The wrongdoer counts upon good faith and\n",
      "honesty in others; otherwise there would be nothing beneficial to\n",
      "him in violating these ties. Wrong consists in faithlessness to that\n",
      "upon which the wrongdoer counts when he is judging and\n",
      "seeking for what is good to him. He betrays the principles upon\n",
      "which he depends; he turns to his personal advantage the very\n",
      "values which he refuses to acknowledge in his own conduct\n",
      "towards others. He contradicts, not as Kant would have it, some\n",
      "abstract law of reason, but the principle of reciprocity when he\n",
      "refuses to extend to others the goods which he seeks for himself.\n",
      "The justification of the moral non-conformist is that when he\n",
      "denies the rightfulness of a particular claim he is doing so not for\n",
      "the sake of private advantage, but for the sake of an object which\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "will serve more amply and consistently the welfare of all. The\n",
      "burden of proof is upon him. In asserting the rightfulness of his\n",
      "own judgment of what is obligatory, he is implicitly putting forth\n",
      "a social claim, something therefore to be tested and confirmed by\n",
      "further trial by others. He therefore recognizes that when he\n",
      "protests he is liable to suffer the consequences that result from\n",
      "his protesting; he will strive with patience and cheerfulness to\n",
      "convince others.\n",
      "If patience, cheerfulness, freedom from conceit, self-display,\n",
      "and self-pity are demanded of the moral non-conformist, there is\n",
      "a correlative duty imposed upon conformists: namely, the duty\n",
      "of toleration. History shows how much of moral progress has\n",
      "been due to those who in their own time were regarded as rebels\n",
      "and treated as criminals. The heart of reflective morality is\n",
      "reflection, and reflection is sure to result in criticism of some matters\n",
      "generally accepted and in proposals for variation of what is\n",
      "currently regarded as right. Toleration is thus not just an attitude of\n",
      "good-humored indifference. It is positive willingness to permit\n",
      "reflection and inquiry to go on in the faith that the truly right\n",
      "will be rendered more secure through questioning and\n",
      "discussion, while things which have endured merely from custom will\n",
      "be amended or done away with. Toleration of difference in moral\n",
      "judgment is a duty which those most insistent upon duty find it\n",
      "hardest to learn. As soon as one enemy of inquiry and public\n",
      "discussion is overcome, new enemies with new plausible reasons for\n",
      "exercising censorship and suppression of thought arise. And yet\n",
      "without freedom of thought and expression of ideas, moral\n",
      "progress can occur only accidentally and by stealth. Mankind\n",
      "still prefers upon the whole to rely upon force, not now exercised\n",
      "directly and physically as it was once, but upon covert and\n",
      "indirect force, rather than upon intelligence to discover and cling to\n",
      "what is right.\n",
      "§ 5. The Sense of Duty\n",
      "Corresponding to the generalized form in which\n",
      "demands are made there grows up a generalized sense of Duty—a\n",
      "sense of being bound by that which is right because of its\n",
      "rightfulness. At first, duties are connected with specific relations, like\n",

      "                            \n",
      "those of a child to his parents, to his brothers and sisters. But\n",
      "with increasing moral maturity, there develops a sense of\n",
      "obligation in distinction from any particular situation. While a general\n",
      "idea arises out of the recurrence of special situations, it is more\n",
      "than a mere extract from them. It constitutes also a new attitude\n",
      "toward further special situations. A person may use a variety of\n",
      "things in succession as if they were tables. When he has the\n",
      "general idea of a table, he is in possession of a principle of action.\n",
      "He can use his idea as an ideal, as something by which to\n",
      "criticize existing tables, and by which, under changed conditions, to\n",
      "invent a new table. One might warm himself by a fire a thousand\n",
      "times without having it occur to him to make a fire when he is\n",
      "cold. When he has the general idea of a fire, he has something\n",
      "which is emancipated from any given case and which may be\n",
      "employed to generate a fire when there is none in actual existence.\n",
      "So a person with a general conception of duty will have a new\n",
      "attitude; he will be on the lookout for situations in which the\n",
      "idea applies. He will have an ideal or standard to which he must\n",
      "bring up particular cases.\n",
      "While general ideas are of utmost value in the direction and\n",
      "enlargement of conduct, they are also dangerous: they tend to be\n",
      "set up as fixed things in themselves, apart from reference to any\n",
      "particular case. Such is the case when there develops the idea of\n",
      "\"duty for the sake of duty.\" Here the notion of duty is isolated\n",
      "from the demands of special situations and is made a fetish.\n",
      "Conformity to the letter of the law then takes the place of\n",
      "faithfulness to its spirit—to its usefulness in calling attention to the\n",
      "good which is wider than that of immediate convenience or strong\n",
      "appetite. Duty is made to take precedence of all human claims,\n",
      "instead of operating as a reminder to consider human claims in a\n",
      "large way. The proper function of a general sense of duty is to\n",
      "make us sensitive to the relations and claims involved in\n",
      "particular situations, and this sensitiveness is especially needed\n",
      "whenever some immediate solicitation of desire tends to blind us to\n",
      "everything but itself. A generalized sense of right is a support in\n",
      "times of temptation; it gives a reenforcing impetus in carrying us\n",
      "over a hard place in conduct. A mother is habitually attentive to\n",
      "the claims of her offspring. Nevertheless, cases arise when it is\n",
      "much easier for her to put her own comfort first. A generalized\n",
      "sense of right and obligation is a great protection; it makes the\n",
      "  \n",

      "general habit consciously available. But such a general sense as\n",
      "this grows out of occasions when the mother was faithful\n",
      "because she was actuated by direct affection for the child and\n",
      "direct interest in his welfare. A sense of duty is a weak staff when it\n",
      "is not the outcome of a habit formed in whole-hearted\n",
      "recognition of the value of the ties involved in concrete cases.\n",
      "A sense of a common value and interest binding persons\n",
      "together is therefore the normal support and guide. But we are all\n",
      "of us subject to conditions in which we tend to be insensitive to\n",
      "this value, and where the sense of what is due others is weak in\n",
      "comparison with the force of a contrary inclination. The claims\n",
      "of others then find a valuable ally in a generalized sense of right\n",
      "and obligation which has been growing up because of previous\n",
      "appreciations of concrete relations.\n",
      "In the final part of our discussion of the Good and moral\n",

      "very differently in building up the power of good practical\n",
      "judgment. The same thing is true, and perhaps in even a greater\n",
      "degree, of the relation of social institutions to fostering loyalty,\n",
      "faithfulness, to the Right. There are social institutions which\n",

      "a specious, a conventional, or even hypocritical, loyalty. This\n",
      "happens when fear of suffering if one does not conform, is the\n",
      "leading consideration. Some social conditions foster external\n",
      "acknowledgment of duty at the expense of personal and critical\n",
      "judgment of ends and values. Other conditions induce men to\n",
      "think about what is truly right, and to create new forms of\n",
      "obligation. At present, without doubt, the social scene is so complex\n",
      "and so subject to rapid change, that its effect is distracting. It is\n",
      "hard to find any compass which will give steady guidance to\n",
      "conduct. In consequence the demand for a truly reflective, a\n",

      "Conduct is complex. It is so complex that attempts to\n",
      "reduce it intellectually to a single principle have failed. We have\n",
      "already noted two leading considerations which cut across each\n",
      "other: ends which are judged to satisfy desire, and the claims of\n",
      "right and duty which inhibit desire.\n",
      "Although different schools of theory have tried to derive one\n",
      "from the other, they remain in some respects independent\n",
      "variables. Still another school of moralists has been impressed by the\n",
      "universality in conduct of actions which manifest approval and\n",
      "disapproval, praise and blame, sympathetic encouragement\n",
      "and resentment. Theorists of this school have been struck with\n",
      "the spontaneity and directness of such actions, since it is\n",
      "\"natural,\" in the most immediate sense of the word, for men to show\n",
      "favor or disfavor toward the conduct of others. This is done\n",
      "without conscious reflection, without reference to the ideas of\n",
      "either a Good end which is to be attained or of a Duty which is\n",
      "authoritative. In fact, according to this school, the ideas of Good\n",
      "and Duty are secondary; the Good is that which calls out\n",
      "approbation; duties are derived from the pressure of others\n",
      "expressed in the rewards and penalties, in the praise and blame,\n",
      "they spontaneously attach to acts.\n",
      "Upon this view, the problem of reflective morality is to\n",
      "discover the basis upon which men unconsciously manifest\n",
      "approval and resentment. In making explicit what is implicit in the\n",
      "spontaneous and direct attitudes of praise and blame, reflection\n",
      "introduces consistency and system into the reactions which take\n",
      "place without thought. It is significant that in morals the word\n",
      "\"judgment\" has a double sense. In respect to knowledge, the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "word has an intellectual sense. To judge is to weigh pros and\n",
      "cons in thought and decide according to the balance of evidence.\n",
      "This signification is the only one recognized in logical theory. But\n",
      "in human relations, it has a definitely practical meaning. To\n",
      "\"judge\" is to condemn or approve, praise or blame. Such\n",
      "judgments are practical reactions, not coldly intellectual\n",
      "propositions. They manifest favor and disfavor, and on account of the\n",
      "sensitiveness of persons to the likes and dislikes of others\n",
      "exercise a positive influence on those judged. The injunction in the\n",
      "New Testament \"Judge not\" is a familiar instance of this usage of\n",
      "judgment; it also indicates that indulgence in such judgments is\n",
      "itself a moral matter. The desire on one side to escape censure\n",
      "has a counterpart, as a motive of conduct, in a tendency to\n",
      "exhibit superiority by indulging in condemnation of others.\n",
      "There is nothing more spontaneous, more \"instinctive,\" than\n",
      "praise and blame of others. Reflective morality notes the\n",
      "inconsistency and arbitrary variations in popular expressions of esteem\n",
      "and disapproval, and seeks to discover a rational principle by which\n",
      "they will be justified and rendered coherent. It notes especially\n",
      "that unreflective acclaim and reproof merely repeat and reflect the\n",
      "scheme of values which is embodied in the social habits of a\n",
      "particular group. Thus a militant community admires and extols all\n",
      "warlike achievements and traits; an industrialized community sets\n",
      "store by thrift, calculation, constancy of labor, and applauds\n",
      "those persons who exhibit these qualities. In one group \"success\"\n",
      "signifies prowess; in the other group, the amassing of property;\n",
      "and praise and blame are correspondingly awarded. In Greek life,\n",
      "the contrast between the system of acts and dispositions prized by\n",
      "the Athenian and Spartan respectively was a stock theme of\n",
      "moralists. Recently, an analogous opposition has been set up by some\n",
      "critics between \"Americanism\" and \"Europeanism.\"\n",
      "These differences inevitably lead in time to asking a question:\n",
      "What plan of commendation and reprobation is to be itself\n",
      "approved and adopted? The question is the more acute because of\n",
      "the great influence of the attitude of others in shaping\n",
      "disposition. Habitual attitudes of favor and disfavor, often expressed in\n",
      "overt punishment and tangible reward and almost always in\n",
      "ridicule and conferring of prestige, are the weapons of\n",
      "customary morality. Moreover they are so deeply engrained in human\n",

      "nature, that, according to one view, the whole business of\n",
      "reflective morality and of moral theory is to determine a rational\n",
      "principle as the basis for their operation. The point may be\n",
      "illustrated by reference to the conceptions of virtue and vice. The\n",
      "theory in question holds that the morally good, as distinct from\n",
      "the good of satisfying desire, is the same as the virtuous; it holds\n",
      "that the right is also the virtuous, while the morally bad and the\n",
      "wrong are one with what is vicious. But the virtuous at first\n",
      "signifies that which is approved; the vicious that which is\n",
      "condemned. In customary morality, acts and traits of character are\n",
      "not esteemed because they are virtuous; rather they are virtues\n",
      "because they are supported by social approval and admiration.\n",
      "So virtue means valor in a martial society, and denotes\n",
      "enterprise, thrift, industriousness in an industrialized community,\n",
      "while it may signify poverty, rags, ascetic habits, in a community\n",
      "in which devotion to supernatural things is prized as the highest\n",
      "good. Reflection tries to reverse the order: it wants to discover\n",
      "what should be esteemed so that approbation will follow what is\n",
      "decided to be worth approving, instead of designating virtues on\n",
      "the basis of what happens to be especially looked up to and\n",
      "rewarded in a particular society.\n",
      "§ 2. The Nature of Standards and of Utilitarian Theory\n",
      "The principle upon which the assignment of praise and\n",
      "blame rationally rests constitutes what is known as a standard. It\n",
      "is the foundation of judgment in its practical sense. In this type\n",
      "of theory the concept of Standard occupies the place held\n",
      "respectively by Good and Duty in the other theories already\n",
      "considered. The principle by which acclaim and reprehension should be\n",
      "regulated is made the dominant ethical \"category,\" taking\n",
      "precedence of the good and the obligatory. For, on this theory, that\n",
      "which is morally good is that which is approved, while the right\n",
      "is that which should be approved. Duties pass from the mere de\n",
      "facto realm of things exacted by social pressure into the de jure\n",
      "realm of acts which are rightfully demanded only as they agree\n",
      "with the Standard of approval; otherwise they are coercive and\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "are restrictive of freedom. The right is that which deserves\n",
      "commendation; the wrong is that which merits punishment, overt or\n",
      "attenuated to the form of censure.\n",
      "It is significant that, upon the whole, the idea of approval or\n",
      "disapproval and its proper standard is characteristic of English\n",
      "moral theory, as that of Ends is of Greek and Duty of Roman\n",
      "ethical philosophy. It is implicit in Greek theory in the\n",
      "importance attached to measure and proportionateness in judging acts\n",
      "and in the tendency to identify to agathon, the good, with to\n",
      "kalon, the beautiful. But in English moral theorizing the\n",
      "manifestation of commendation and condemnation, and their\n",
      "influence upon the formation of character, are for the first time made\n",
      "central. It appears in Shaftesbury as an immediate intuition of\n",
      "moral sense, strictly comparable to \"good taste\" in esthetic\n",
      "matters; to Hume, approbation is identical with what \"pleases\n",
      "on a general view,\" that is after reflective generalization in\n",
      "distinction from first and personal reaction; Adam Smith's\n",
      "conception that it is what satisfies the \"impartial spectator\" is a variant\n",
      "of the same notion.\n",
      "To Bentham, most of the interpretations of his predecessors\n",
      "were still infected too much with \"ipse dixitism,\" the vice,\n",
      "according to him, of all intuitional theories. He sought for a\n",
      "general and impersonal, an objective, principle which should\n",
      "control and justify the personal reactions of good taste or whatever.\n",
      "In Smith and especially in Hume he found implicit the concept\n",
      "that the usefulness of a deed or a trait of character to others is\n",
      "the ultimate ground of approval, while disservice, harmfulness,\n",
      "is the ground of condemnation and depreciation. Men\n",
      "spontaneously applaud acts which help them, which further their\n",
      "happiness; no explanation has to be sought for this fact.\n",
      "Sympathy is also an original trait of human nature. Because of\n",
      "sympathy we praise acts which assist others even when our own\n",
      "fortunes are not involved; we are moved sympathetically to\n",
      "indignation by wilful infliction of suffering on third parties.\n",
      "Sympathy instinctively transports us to their position, and we share\n",
      "their glow of liking and their fire of resentment as if we were\n",
      "personally concerned. Only the abnormally callous are untouched\n",
      "emotionally by heroic acts of devotion to the welfare of others or\n",
      "by deeds of base ingratitude and malicious spite.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "There are, however, definite limitations to the spontaneous\n",
      "and customary exercise of sympathetic admiration and\n",
      "resentment. It rarely extends beyond those near to us, members of our\n",
      "own family and our friends. It rarely operates with reference to\n",
      "those out of sight or to strangers, certainly not to enemies. In the\n",
      "second place, unreflective admiration and disesteem are\n",
      "superficial. They take account of striking, conspicuous cases of help\n",
      "and injury, but not those of a more delicate and subtle sort; they\n",
      "take notice of consequences in the way of assistance and harm\n",
      "which show themselves in a short time, but not those which\n",
      "emerge later, even though the latter are in truth the more\n",
      "important. And, finally, when certain acts have become thoroughly\n",
      "habitual, they are taken for granted like phenomena of nature and\n",
      "are not judged at all. The beneficial and hurtful consequences of\n",
      "laws and institutions, for example, are not taken into account by\n",
      "customary morality.\n",
      "Hence follow certain changes introduced by the utilitarian\n",
      "theory of the standard of approbation. When men recognize that\n",
      "contribution to universal happiness or welfare is the only ground\n",
      "for admiration and esteem, they eliminate the three limitations\n",
      "just mentioned. The standard is generalized; judgment must be\n",
      "passed upon consequences of weal and woe for all sentient\n",
      "creatures who are affected by an act. The same emphasis upon\n",
      "general or widespread consequences, brings to the fore the idea of\n",
      "equality, and does it in a way which transforms the customary\n",
      "award of praise and blame, sympathy and resentment. For the\n",
      "latter does not put the happiness of self and of others, of a\n",
      "member of the family and the outsider, of a fellow citizen and a\n",
      "stranger, of nobleman and commoner, of the lord and the\n",
      "peasant, of the man of distinction and the obscure person, of rich\n",
      "and poor, upon the same footing. But the utilitarian theory, in\n",
      "addition to its insistence upon taking into consideration the\n",
      "widest, most general range of consequences, insists that in\n",
      "estimating consequences in the way of help and harm, pleasure and\n",
      "suffering, each one shall count as one, irrespective of distinctions\n",
      "of birth, sex, race, social status, economic and political position.\n",
      "It is significant that the rise and chief influence of utilitarianism\n",
      "in England coincided socially with the manifestation of\n",
      "philanthropic sentiment on a large scale, and politically with the\n",

      "So far we have passed by one important feature of\n",
      "utilitarianism. We have spoken in general terms of welfare, of benefit\n",
      "and injury, with no attempt to specify in just what they consist.\n",
      "Bentham, however, prided himself upon the fact that\n",
      "utilitarianism had a definite and measurable conception of their nature.\n",
      "They consist, according to him, of units of pleasure and pain,\n",
      "being merely their algebraic summation. Thus he reduced,\n",
      "according to his followers, the vague notion of welfare and\n",
      "happiness to a fact so precise as to be capable of quantitative\n",
      "statement. Thus Mill said: \"He introduced into morals and politics those habits of\n",
      "thought, and modes of investigation, which are essential to the idea ofsci-ence.\n",

      "objections which can be brought against hedonism (see p. 192).\n",
      "Nor did the consequences of their identification stop at this\n",
      "point. It involved utilitarianism, as its critics promptly pointed\n",

      "Purposes, aims, ends-in-view, are distinct from\n",
      "standards and yet are closely related to them; and vice versa. Ends-\n",
      "in-view are connected with desire; they look to the future,\n",
      "because they are projections of the objects in which desires would\n",
      "be satisfied. Standards, on the other hand, envisage acts already\n",
      "performed or viewed in imagination as if they had been\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "performed. An object viewed as an end or fulfillment of desire is\n",
      "good in proportion as it is found to be a genuine satisfaction or\n",
      "realization of desire. From the standpoint of a standard, an act is\n",
      "good if it can evoke and sustain approbation. At the outset, the\n",
      "approbation in question is that proceeding from others. Will the\n",
      "group, or some particular influential member of the group,\n",
      "tolerate, abet, encourage, praise me if I act thus and so? The\n",
      "admiration and resentment of others is the mirror in which one beholds\n",
      "the moral quality of his act reflected back to him. Because of this\n",
      "reflection the agent can judge his act from a standpoint which is\n",
      "different from that of a satisfaction directly promised. He is led\n",
      "to widen and generalize his conception of his act when he takes\n",
      "into account the reaction of others; he views his act objectively\n",
      "when he takes the standpoint of standard; personally, when it is\n",
      "an end merely as such.\n",
      "Later on, the thought of the reaction of favor or disfavor of a\n",
      "particular social group or a particular person tends to recede to\n",
      "the background. An ideal spectator is projected and the doer of\n",
      "the act looks at his proposed act through the eyes of this\n",
      "impartial and far-seeing objective judge. Although end and standard\n",
      "are two distinct conceptions having different meanings, yet it is\n",
      "the very nature of a standard to demand that what is approvable\n",
      "according to it shall become an end. In other words, it calls for\n",
      "the creation of a new end; or, in case the end suggested by desire\n",
      "is approved, for an end with a new quality, that of having\n",
      "received the stamp of approval. Unless the conception of standard\n",
      "arose from a different source and had a different meaning from\n",
      "that of ends, it could not exercise a controlling formative\n",
      "influence on the latter. The significance of the standard is that it\n",
      "involves a conception of the way in which ends that are adopted\n",
      "should be formed; namely, that they should be such as to merit\n",
      "approbation because their execution will conduce to the general\n",
      "well-being.\n",
      "Recognition of this fact enables us to deal with a problem\n",
      "which is attended with a good deal of difficulty. The problem is\n",
      "illustrated in the so-called hedonistic paradox, that the way to\n",
      "attain pleasure is not to seek for it. And this saying may be\n",
      "paralleled by another paradox, namely, that the way to achieve virtue\n",
      "is not to aim directly at it. For the standard is not the same as the\n",

      "Indeed, it is hard to imagine its being made the end of desire; as a\n",
      "direct object to be aimed at, it would be so indeterminate and\n",
      "vague that it would only arouse a diffused sentimental state,\n",
      "without indicating just how and where conduct should be\n",
      "directed. Desire on the other hand points to a definite and concrete\n",
      "object at which to aim. After this end has occurred to the mind it\n",
      "is examined and tested from another point of view: Would the\n",
      "action which achieves it further the well-being of all concerned?\n",
      "The idea of happiness is originally derived from cases of\n",
      "fulfilled desire. It is a general term for the fact that while desires are\n",
      "different and the objects which satisfy them are different, there is\n",
      "one common quality in all of them: namely, the fact of being\n",
      "fulfillments. This is a formal trait. It is a mistake to suppose that\n",
      "there is homogeneity of material or content, just because there is\n",
      "the single name \"happiness.\" One might as well suppose that all\n",
      "persons named Smith are just alike because they have the same\n",
      "name. No two concrete cases of happiness are just like each\n",
      "other in actual stuff and make-up. They are alike in being cases\n",
      "of fulfillment, of meeting the requirements set up by some desire.\n",
      "A miser finds satisfaction in storing up money, and a liberal\n",
      "person in spending it to give happiness to others. One man is happy\n",
      "when he gets ahead of others in some tangible way and another\n",
      "man is happy when he helps others out of some trouble. In\n",
      "material content, the two cases differ radically; in form they are alike,\n",
      "since both occupy the same status and play the same role—that\n",
      "of satisfying a desire.\n",
      "The function of the standard then is to discriminate between\n",

      "which kind of happiness is truly moral; that is, approvable. It\n",
      "says that among the different kinds that one is to be approved\n",
      "which at the same time brings satisfaction to others, or which at\n",
      "least harmonizes with their well-being in that it does not inflict\n",
      "suffering upon them. It does not tell what things should be\n",
      "specifically aimed at. It does tell us how to proceed in passing\n",

      "two; that we cannot be morally satisfied with a world in which\n",

      "one who promotes the interests of others, or in which the\n",
      "conduct which makes others suffer yields happiness to the one who\n",

      "person who stands the best show of being happy is the one who\n",
      "exercises a prudent control over his sympathies, and so keeps\n",
      "from getting involved in the fortunes of other persons. If we once\n",

      "character of setting up a principle of action which is divorced\n",
      "from all consideration of human consequences. Justice as an end\n",
      "in itself is a case of making an idol out of a means at the expense\n",
      "of the end which the means serves. The second factor in the reply\n",
      "to the objection is that justice is not an external means to human\n",
      "welfare but a means which is organically integrated with the end\n",
      "it serves. There are means which are constituent parts of the\n",
      "consequences they bring into being, as tones are integral\n",
      "constituents of music as well as means to its production, and as food is\n",

      "thoroughgoing policy of laissez faire in social matters. He\n",
      "identifies the principle of justice with the relation of cause and effect in\n",
      "its biological meaning, that is with natural selection and the\n",
      "elimination of the unfit in the struggle for existence. It is \"just\"\n",

      "their inferiority and that the superior should reap the rewards\n",

      "selection is thus to violate the law of justice. In other words,\n",
      "Spencer uses the abstract principle of justice to warrant a policy\n",
      "of extreme individualism in letting the \"natural\" play of self-\n",
      "interest in a competitive society take its course. Examples of\n",
      "other interpretations of justice might be given. But the two\n",
      "instances cited should indicate the complete falsity of the common\n",
      "notion that justice carries its definite meaning. The truth lies on\n",
      "the other side. The meaning of justice in concrete cases is\n",
      "something to be determined by seeing what consequences will bring\n",
      "about human welfare in a fair and even way.\n",
      "Another type of objection to social welfare as the standard of\n",
      "approval is that it elevates sentimentality to a supreme position\n",
      "in morals. Thus Carlyle condemned utilitarianism as \"a\n",

      "principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth? or is it the\n",
      "treatment which will tend to evoke his own efforts at moral\n",
      "betterment? Is \"justice\" to be measured on the ground of existing\n",
      "social status, or on the ground of possibilities of development?\n",

      "§ 6. Praise and Blame as Moral Forces\n",
      "It was noted earlier in passing (p. 182) that the concept\n",
      "of virtue is closely connected with the operation of approbation.\n",
      "It is not too much to say of primitive morals that in them traits of\n",
      "character are not approved because they are virtuous, but are\n",
      "virtuous because they are approved, while whatever is generally\n",
      "censured is ipso facto, regarded as vicious. Reflective morality\n",
      "reverses this attitude. It is concerned to discover what traits of\n",
      "character should be approved; it identifies virtue not with that\n",
      "which is de facto approved but that which is approvable, which\n",
      "should be approved. But, as we have often had occasion to note,\n",
      "a large strain of customary morality holds over in morality which\n",
      "is theoretically reflective. \"Conventional morality\" is precisely a\n",
      "morality of praise and blame based on the code of valuations\n",
      "which happens to be current at a particular time in a particular\n",
      "social group. Whatever conforms, at least outwardly, to current\n",
      "practices, especially those of an institutional sort, receives\n",
      "commendation or at least passes without censure; whatever deviates\n",
      "exposes one to censure. The practical effect is a negative\n",
      "morality; virtue is identified with \"respectability,\" and respectability\n",
      "means such conduct as is exempt from overt reproach and\n",
      "censure rather than what is inherently worthy of respect. The moral\n",
      "ideal of multitudes of persons comes to be that sort of behavior\n",
      "which will pass without arousing adverse comment, just as a\n",
      "child too often identifies the \"right\" with whatever passes\n",
      "without a scolding.\n",
      "Accordingly, this is a convenient place in which to consider the\n",
      "point we passed over at first, namely, the proper moral place and\n",
      "function of praise and blame.\n",
      "At first sight, it might seem as if reflection on the customary\n",
      "use of approbation and condemnation would still leave praise\n",
      "and blame as primary factors, only giving them a standard by\n",
      "which to operate. Such is not the case, however. Reflection reacts\n",
      "to modify the character and use of praise and blame. The latter\n",
      "tend to fix the attention of the one commended or reprobated\n",
      "upon the way in which he can secure the one and avoid the other.\n",
      "Their effect therefore is to distract attention from the reasons and\n",
      "causes which make conduct praiseworthy and blameworthy.\n",
      "Habitual exposure to praise and blame makes one think of how he\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "may exculpate himself from accusation and may recommend\n",
      "himself to favor. Morality that makes much of blaming breeds a\n",
      "defensive and apologetic attitude; the person subjected to it\n",
      "thinks up excuses instead of thinking what objects are worthy to\n",
      "be pursued. Moreover, it distracts attention from thought of\n",
      "objective conditions and causes, because it tends to make one\n",
      "want to get even for being blamed by passing the blame on to\n",
      "others. One relieves himself from a charge by transferring it\n",
      "to some one else. In stronger natures, resentment is produced\n",
      "and to a point where the person blamed feels he is doing a brave\n",
      "thing in defying all authority. In others, it produces a feeling\n",
      "which put in words amounts to: \"What is the use? It makes no\n",
      "difference what I do, since I get blamed anyway.\"\n",
      "Reflective morality instead of leaving praise and blame where\n",
      "they were except for putting under them a rational basis tends to\n",
      "shift the emphasis to scrutiny of conduct in an objective way,\n",
      "that is with reference to its causes and results. What is desirable\n",
      "is that a person shall see for himself what he is doing and why\n",
      "he is doing it; shall be sensitive to results in fact and in\n",
      "anticipation, and shall be able to analyze the forces which make him act\n",
      "as he does act. Accordingly, approval and disapproval\n",
      "themselves are subjected to judgment by a standard instead of being\n",
      "taken as ultimate. On the whole, the prevalence of a morality\n",
      "based on praise and blame is evidence of the extent to which\n",
      "customary and conventional forces still influence a morality\n",
      "nominally reflective. The possession of a reflective standard checks\n",
      "and directs the use of praise and blame as it does the use of other\n",
      "human tendencies. It makes men realize that reward and\n",
      "punishment, commendation and condemnation are good or bad\n",
      "according to their consequences and that they may be used\n",
      "immorally as well as helpfully.\n",
      "We have already noted the reflex origin of the traits regarded\n",
      "as virtuous and vicious. They are derived at the outset from the\n",
      "conceptions of merit and demerit, of deserts; and\n",
      "meritoriousness, deservingness, is measured by the reactions of others. It is\n",
      "others who, approving and disapproving, award honor, esteem,\n",
      "merit. For this reason, as has also been noted, virtues and vices in\n",
      "morals as far as dominated by custom are strictly correlative to\n",
      "the ruling institutions and habits of a given social group. Its\n",
      "members are trained to commend and admire whatever\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "conforms to its established ways of life; hence the great divergence\n",
      "of schemes of valuation of conduct in different civilizations.\n",
      "Their common element is formal rather than material—namely,\n",
      "adherence to prevailing customs. Nomos is indeed \"king of all,\"\n",
      "and especially of acts and traits of character deemed virtues and\n",
      "vices.\n",
      "The attempt to discover a standard upon the basis of which\n",
      "approbation and disapprobation, esteem and disesteem, should\n",
      "be awarded has therefore nothing less than a revolutionary effect\n",
      "upon the whole concept of virtue and vice. For it involves\n",
      "criticism of prevailing habits of valuation. The very idea of a\n",
      "standard is intellectual; it implies something universally applicable.\n",
      "It does not eliminate the element of favor and hostility to certain\n",
      "modes of conduct. But it introduces the regulation of these\n",
      "manifestations by something beyond themselves. Customary morals\n",
      "naturally \"make it hot\" for those who transgress its code, and\n",
      "make it comfortable for those who conform. The reflective\n",
      "standard holds individuals to responsibility for the ways in which\n",
      "favor and dislike are expressed. It makes prominent the fact that\n",
      "in judging, in commending and condemning, we are judging\n",
      "ourselves, revealing our own tastes and desires. Approval and\n",
      "disapproval, the attitude of attributing vice and virtue, becomes itself a\n",
      "vice or a virtue according to the way in which it is administered.\n",
      "§ 7. The Conception of Virtue in Reflective Morality\n",
      "In customary morality it is possible to draw up a list or\n",
      "catalogue of vices and virtues. For the latter reflect some definite\n",
      "existing custom, and the former some deviation from or\n",
      "violation of custom. The acts approved and disapproved have\n",
      "therefore the same definiteness and fixity as belong to the customs to\n",
      "which they refer. In reflective morality, a list of virtues has a\n",
      "much more tentative status. Chastity, kindness, honesty,\n",
      "patriotism, modesty, toleration, bravery, etc., cannot be given a\n",
      "fixed meaning, because each expresses an interest in objects and\n",
      "institutions which are changing. In form, as interests, they may\n",
      "be permanent, since no community could endure in which there\n",
      "were not, say, fair dealing, public spirit, regard for life,\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "faithfulness to others. But no two communities conceive the objects to\n",
      "which these qualities attach in quite identical ways. They can be\n",
      "defined, therefore, only on the basis of qualities characteristic of\n",
      "interest, not on the basis of permanent and uniform objects in\n",
      "which interest is taken. This is as true of, say, temperance and\n",
      "chastity as it is of regard for life, which in some communities\n",
      "does not extend to girl babies nor to the aged, and which in all\n",
      "historic communities is limited by war with hostile communities.\n",
      "Accordingly we shall discuss virtue through enumeration of\n",
      "traits which must belong to an attitude if it is to be genuinely an\n",
      "interest, not by an enumeration of virtues as if they were separate\n",
      "entities. (1) An interest must be wholehearted. Virtue is integrity,\n",
      "vice is duplicity. Sincerity is another name for the same quality,\n",
      "for it signifies that devotion to an object is unmixed and\n",
      "undiluted. The quality has a much broader scope than might at first\n",
      "seem to be the case.\n",
      "Conscious hypocrisy is rare. Divided and inconsistent interest\n",
      "is common. Devotion that is complete, knowing no reservations\n",
      "and exceptions, is extremely difficult to attain. We imagine we\n",
      "are whole-hearted when we throw ourselves into a line of action\n",
      "which is agreeable, failing to notice that we give up or act upon an\n",
      "incompatible interest when obstacles arise. Whole-heartedness is\n",
      "something quite different from immediate enthusiasm and ardor.\n",
      "It always has an emotional quality, but it is far from being\n",
      "identical with a succession of even intense emotional likings for a\n",
      "succession of things into each of which we eagerly throw ourselves.\n",
      "For it requires consistency, continuity, and community of\n",
      "purpose and effort. And this condition cannot be fulfilled except\n",
      "when the various objects and ends which succeed one another\n",
      "have been brought into order and unity by reflection upon the\n",
      "nature and bearing of each one. We cannot be genuinely whole-\n",
      "hearted unless we are single-minded.\n",
      "Hence (2) the interest which constitutes a disposition virtuous\n",
      "must be continuous and persistent. One swallow does not make\n",
      "a summer nor does a passing right interest, no matter how strong,\n",
      "constitute a virtue. Fair weather \"virtue\" has a bad name\n",
      "because it indicates lack of stability. It demands character to stick it\n",
      "out when conditions are adverse, as they are when there is\n",
      "danger of incurring the ill-will of others, or when it requires more\n",
      "than ordinary energy to overcome obstacles. The vitality of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "interest in what is reflectively approved is attested by persistence\n",
      "under unfavorable conditions.\n",
      "A complete interest must be (3) impartial as well as enduring.\n",
      "Interest, apart from a character formed and fortified through\n",
      "reflection, is partial, and in that sense divided and, though\n",
      "unconsciously, insincere. A person readily tends to evince interest in\n",
      "the well-being of friends and members of his family, and to be\n",
      "indifferent to those with whom he is not bound by ties of\n",
      "gratitude or affection. It is easy to have one scale for determining\n",
      "interest in those of one's own nation and a totally different one for\n",
      "the regard of those of another race, color, religion, or nationality.\n",
      "Complete universality of interest is, of course, impossible in the\n",
      "sense of equality of strength or force of quantity; that is, it would\n",
      "be mere pretense to suppose that one can be as much interested\n",
      "in those at a distance with whom one has little contact as in\n",
      "those with whom one is in constant communication. But equity,\n",
      "or impartiality, of interest is a matter of quality not of quantity\n",
      "as in-iquity is a matter not of more or less, but of using uneven\n",
      "measures of judgment. Equity demands that when one has to act\n",
      "in relation to others, no matter whether friends or strangers,\n",
      "fellow citizens or foreigners, one should have an equal and even\n",
      "measure of value as far as the interests of the others come into\n",
      "the reckoning. In an immediate or emotional sense it is not\n",
      "possible to love our enemies as we love our friends. But the maxim\n",
      "to love our enemies as we love ourselves signifies that in our\n",
      "conduct we should take into account their interests at the same rate\n",
      "of estimate as we rate our own. It is a principle for regulating\n",
      "judgment of the bearings of our acts on the happiness of others.\n",
      "Single-mindedness of purpose would be narrow were it not\n",
      "united to breadth and impartiality of interest. The conception\n",
      "that virtue resides in fundamental and thoroughgoing interest in\n",
      "approved objects accomplishes more than merely saving us from\n",
      "the identification of virtues with whatever is conventionally and\n",
      "currently prized in a particular community or social set. For it\n",
      "protects us from an unreal separation of virtuous qualities from\n",
      "one another. The mere idea of a catalogue of different virtues\n",
      "commits us to the notion that virtues may be kept apart, pigeon-\n",
      "holed in water-tight compartments. In fact virtuous traits\n",
      "interpenetrate one another; this unity is involved in the very idea of\n",
      "integrity of character. At one time persistence and endurance in\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the face of obstacles is the most prominent feature; then the\n",
      "attitude is the excellence called courage. At another time, the trait\n",
      "of impartiality and equity is uppermost, and we call it justice. At\n",
      "other times, the necessity for subordinating immediate\n",
      "satisfaction of a strong appetite or desire to a comprehensive good is the\n",
      "conspicuous feature. Then the disposition is denominated\n",
      "temperance, self-control. When the prominent phase is the need for\n",
      "thoughtfulness, for consecutive and persistent attention, in order\n",
      "that these other qualities may function, the interest receives the\n",
      "name of moral wisdom, insight, conscientiousness. In each case\n",

      "negative and restrictive. When, for example, an independent thing is\n",

      "mechanical and quantitative form, like the exact meting out of\n",
      "praise and blame, reward and punishment. Or it is thought of as\n",
      "vindication of abstract and impersonal law—an attitude which\n",
      "always tends to make men vindictive and leads them to justify\n",
      "their harshness as a virtue. To the notion of courage there still\n",

      "which does not at some time meet difficulties and obstacles that\n",
      "are disagreeable, we also recognize that courage is no separate\n",

      "One such saying is that \"love is the fulfilling of the law.\" For in\n",

      "§ 1. Moral Judgments as Intuitive or Developed\n",
      "That reflective morality, since it is reflective, involves\n",
      "thought and knowledge is a truism. The truism raises, however,\n",
      "important problems of theory. What is the nature of knowledge\n",
      "in its moral sense? What is its function? How does it originate\n",
      "and operate? To these questions, writers upon morals have given\n",
      "different answers. Those, for example, who have dwelt upon\n",
      "approval and resentment as the fundamental ethical factor have\n",
      "emphasized its spontaneous and \"instinctive\" character—that is,\n",
      "its non-reflective nature—and have assigned a subordinate\n",
      "position to the intellectual factor in morals. Those who, like Kant,\n",
      "have made the authority of duty supreme, have marked off\n",
      "Moral Reason from thought and reasoning as they show\n",
      "themselves in ordinary life and in science. They have erected a unique\n",

      "insight into the ends which bring enduring satisfaction, the\n",
      "supreme thing in conduct; ignorance, as Plato said, is the root of all\n",
      "evil. And yet, according to Plato, this assured insight into the\n",

      "mere servants and attendants of emotion, or do they exercise a\n",
      "positive and transforming influence? Secondly, are the thought\n",
      "and judgment employed in connection with moral matters the\n",
      "same that are used in ordinary practical affairs, or are they\n",
      "something separate, having an exclusively moral significance? Putting\n",
      "the question in the form which it assumed in discussion during\n",
      "the nineteenth century: Is conscience a faculty of intuition\n",
      "independent of human experience, or is it a product and expression\n",
      "of experience?\n",
      "The questions are stated in a theoretical form. They have,\n",
      "however, an important practical bearing. They are connected,\n",
      "for example, with the question discussed in the last chapter. Are\n",
      "praise and blame, esteem and condemnation, not only original\n",
      "and spontaneous tendencies, but are they also ultimate,\n",
      "incapable of being modified by the critical and constructive work of\n",
      "thought? Again, if conscience is a unique and separate faculty it\n",
      "is incapable of education and modification; it can only be\n",
      "directly appealed to. Most important of all, practically, is that\n",
      "some theories, like the Kantian, make a sharp separation\n",
      "between conduct that is moral and everyday conduct which is\n",
      "morally indifferent and neutral.\n",
      "It would be difficult to find a question more significant for\n",
      "actual behavior than just this one: Is the moral region isolated\n",
      "from the rest of human activity? Does only one special class of\n",
      "human aims and relations have moral value? This conclusion is a\n",
      "necessary result of the view that our moral consciousness and\n",
      "knowledge is unique in kind. But if moral consciousness is not\n",
      "separate, then no hard and fast line can be drawn within conduct\n",
      "shutting off a moral realm from a non-moral. Now our whole\n",
      "previous discussion is bound up with the latter view. For it has\n",
      "found moral good and excellence in objects and activities which\n",
      "develop out of natural desires and normal social relations in\n",
      "family, neighborhood, and community. We shall accordingly now\n",
      "proceed to make explicit the bearing of this idea upon the nature\n",
      "of moral insight, comparing our conclusions with those arrived\n",
      "at by some other typical theories.\n",
      "Moral judgments, whatever else they are, are a species of\n",
      "judgments of value. They characterize acts and traits of character as\n",
      "having worth, positive or negative. Judgments of value are not\n",

      "as judgment (which involves thought in placing the thing judged\n",
      "in its relations and bearings) and valuing as a direct emotional\n",
      "and practical act. There is difference between esteem and\n",
      "estimation, between prizing and appraising. To esteem is to prize, hold\n",
      "dear, admire, approve; to estimate is to measure in intellectual\n",
      "fashion. One is direct, spontaneous; the other is reflex, reflective.\n",

      "Is the object one which we should admire? Should we really\n",
      "prize it? Does it have the qualities which justify our holding it\n",
      "dear? All growth in maturity is attended with this change from a\n",
      "spontaneous to a reflective and critical attitude. First, our\n",
      "affections go out to something in attraction or repulsion; we like and\n",
      "dislike. Then experience raises the question whether the\n",
      "object in question is what our esteem or disesteem took it to be,\n",
      "whether it is such as to justify our reaction to it.\n",

      "principle is of universal application. For to think is to look at a thing in\n",
      "its relations with other things, and such judgment often modifies\n",
      "radically the original attitude of esteem and liking. A\n",
      "commonplace instance is the difference between natural liking for some\n",
      "object of food, and the recognition forced upon us by experience\n",
      "that it is not \"good\" for us, that it is not healthful. A child may\n",
      "like and prize candy inordinately; an adult tells him it is not good\n",
      "for him, that it will make him ill. \"Good\" to the child signifies\n",
      "that which tastes good; that which satisfies an immediate\n",
      "craving. \"Good\" from the standpoint of the more experienced\n",
      "person is that which serves certain ends, that which stands in certain\n",
      "connections with consequences. Judgment of value is the name\n",
      "of the act which searches for and takes into consideration these\n",
      "connections.\n",
      "There is an evident unity between this point and what was said\n",
      "in the last chapter about approval and reprobation, praise and\n",
      "blame. A normal person will not witness an act of wanton cruelty\n",
      "without an immediate response of disfavor; resentment and\n",

      "when some person of whom he is fond is made to suffer by\n",

      "the suffering is a physician who is doing what he does in the\n",

      "transformations are rapidly in process, a revision of old\n",
      "appraisals is especially needed. (c) The tendency of undiluted\n",
      "intuitional theory is in the direction of an unquestioning dogmatism,\n",
      "what Bentham called ipse dixitism. Every intuition, even the\n",
      "best, is likely to become perfunctory and second-hand unless\n",

      "consequences which will accrue from acting upon it. There is no\n",
      "necessary connection between a conviction of right and good in\n",
      "general and what is right and good in particular. A man may\n",
      "have a strong conviction of duty without enlightenment as to\n",
      "just where his duty lies. When he assumes that because he is\n",
      "actuated by consciousness of duty in general, he can trust without\n",
      "reflective inquiry to his immediate ideas of the particular thing\n",
      "which is his duty, he is likely to become socially dangerous. If he\n",
      "is a person of strong will he will attempt to impose his judgments\n",

      "§ 3. Sensitivity and Thoughtfulness\n",
      "The permanent element of value in the intuitional\n",
      "theory lies in its implicit emphasis upon the importance of direct\n",
      "responsiveness to the qualities of situations and acts. A keen eye\n",
      "and a quick ear are not in themselves guarantees of correct\n",
      "knowledge of physical objects. But they are conditions without\n",
      "which such knowledge cannot arise. Nothing can make up for\n",
      "the absence of immediate sensitiveness; the insensitive person\n",
      "is callous, indifferent. Unless there is a direct, mainly\n",
      "unreflective appreciation of persons and deeds, the data for subsequent\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "thought will be lacking or distorted. A person must feel the\n",
      "qualities of acts as one feels with the hands the qualities of\n",
      "roughness and smoothness in objects, before he has an\n",
      "inducement to deliberate or material with which to deliberate. Effective\n",
      "reflection must also terminate in a situation which is directly\n",
      "appreciated, if thought is to be effective in action. \"Cold blooded\"\n",
      "thought may reach a correct conclusion, but if a person remains\n",
      "anti-pathetic or indifferent to the considerations presented to\n",
      "him in a rational way, they will not stir him to act in accord with\n",
      "them (see p. 190).\n",
      "This fact explains the element of truth in the theories which\n",
      "insist that in their root and essence moral judgments are\n",
      "emotional rather than intellectual. A moral judgment, however\n",
      "intellectual it may be, must at least be colored with feeling if it is to\n",
      "influence behavior. Resentment, ranging from fierce abhorrence\n",
      "through disgust to mild repugnance, is a necessary ingredient of\n",
      "knowledge of evil which is genuine knowledge. Affection, from\n",
      "intense love to mild favor, is an ingredient in all operative\n",
      "knowledge, all full apprehension, of the good. It is, however, going too\n",
      "far to say that such appreciation can dispense with every\n",
      "cognitive element. There may be no knowledge of why a given act\n",
      "calls out sympathy or antipathy, no knowledge of the grounds\n",
      "upon which it rests for justification. In fact a strong emotional\n",
      "appreciation seems at the time to be its own reason and\n",
      "justification. But there must at least be an idea of the object which is\n",
      "admired or despised, there must be some perceived cause, or\n",
      "person, that is cared for, and that solicits concern. Otherwise we have\n",
      "mere brute anger like the destructive rage of a beast, or mere\n",
      "immediate gratification like that of an animal in taking food.\n",
      "Our sensory reactions, of eye, ear, hand, nose, and tongue\n",
      "supply material of our knowledge of qualities of physical things,\n",
      "sticks, stones, fruits, etc. It is sometimes argued that they afford\n",
      "also the material of our knowledge of persons; that, seeing\n",
      "certain shapes and colors, hearing certain sounds, etc., we infer by\n",
      "analogy that a particular physical body is inhabited by a sentient\n",
      "and emotional being such as we associate with the forms and\n",
      "contacts which compose our own body. The theory is absurd.\n",
      "Emotional reactions form the chief materials of our knowledge\n",
      "of ourselves and of others. Just as ideas of physical objects\n",
      "are constituted out of sensory material, so those of persons are\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "framed out of emotional and affectional materials. The latter are\n",
      "as direct, as immediate as the former, and more interesting, with\n",
      "a greater hold on attention. The animism of primitive life, the\n",
      "tendency to personify natural events and things (which survives\n",
      "in poetry), is evidence of the original nature of perception of\n",
      "persons; it is inexplicable on the theory that we infer the existence\n",
      "of persons through a round-about use of analogy. Wherever we\n",
      "strongly hate or love, we tend to predicate directly a lovely and\n",
      "loving, a hateful and hating being. Without emotional behavior,\n",
      "all human beings would be for us only animated automatons.\n",
      "Consequently all actions which call out lively esteem or disfavor\n",
      "are perceived as acts of persons: we do not make a distinction in\n",
      "such cases between the doer and the deed. A noble act signifies a\n",
      "noble person; a mean act a mean person.\n",
      "On this account, the reasonable act and the generous act lie\n",
      "close together. A person entirely lacking in sympathetic response\n",
      "might have a keen calculating intellect, but he would have no\n",
      "spontaneous sense of the claims of others for satisfaction of their\n",
      "desires. A person of narrow sympathy is of necessity a person of\n",
      "confined outlook upon the scene of human good. The only truly\n",
      "general thought is the generous thought. It is sympathy which\n",
      "carries thought out beyond the self and which extends its scope\n",
      "till it approaches the universal as its limit. It is sympathy which\n",
      "saves consideration of consequences from degenerating into mere\n",
      "calculation, by rendering vivid the interests of others and urging\n",
      "us to give them the same weight as those which touch our own\n",
      "honor, purse, and power. To put ourselves in the place of others,\n",

      "reach the level they would assume in the eye of an impartial\n",
      "sympathetic observer, is the surest way to attain objectivity of moral\n",
      "knowledge. Sympathy is the animating mold of moral judgment\n",
      "not because its dictates take precedence in action over those of\n",
      "other impulses (which they do not do), but because it furnishes\n",
      "the most efficacious intellectual standpoint. It is the tool, par\n",
      "excellence, for resolving complex situations. Then when it passes\n",
      "into active and overt conduct, it does so fused with other\n",
      "impulses and not in isolation and is thus protected from\n",
      "sentimentality. In this fusion there is broad and objective survey of all\n",
      "desires and projects because there is an expanded personality.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Through sympathy the cold calculation of utilitarianism and the\n",
      "formal law of Kant are transported into vital and moving realities.\n",
      "One of the earliest discoveries of morals was the similarity of\n",
      "judgment of good and bad in conduct with the recognition\n",
      "of beauty and ugliness in conduct. Feelings of the\n",
      "repulsiveness of vice and the attractiveness of virtuous acts root in\n",
      "esthetic sentiment. Emotions of admiration and of disgust are\n",
      "native; when they are turned upon conduct they form an element\n",
      "which furnishes the truth that lies in the theory of a moral sense.\n",
      "The sense of justice, moreover, has a strong ally in the sense of\n",
      "symmetry and proportion. The double meaning of the term\n",
      "\"fair\" is no accident. The Greek sophrosyne (of which our\n",
      "temperance, through the Latin temperantia, is a poor representation),\n",
      "a harmonious blending of affections into a beautiful whole, was\n",
      "essentially an artistic idea. Self-control was its inevitable result,\n",
      "but self-control as a deliberate cause would have seemed as\n",
      "abhorrent to the Athenian as would \"control\" in a building or\n",
      "statue where control signified anything other than the idea of the\n",
      "whole permeating all parts and bringing them into order and\n",
      "measured unity. The Greek emphasis upon Kalokagathos, the\n",
      "Aristotelian identification of virtue with the proportionate mean,\n",
      "are indications of an acute estimate of grace, rhythm, and\n",
      "harmony as dominant traits of good conduct (p. 98). The modern\n",
      "mind has been much less sensitive to esthetic values in general\n",
      "and to these values in conduct in particular. Much has been lost\n",
      "in direct responsiveness to right. The bleakness and harshness\n",
      "often associated with morals is a sign of this loss.\n",
      "The direct valuing which accompanies immediate sensitive\n",
      "responsiveness to acts has its complement and expansion in\n",
      "valuations which are deliberate, reflective. As Aristotle pointed out,\n",
      "only the good man is a good judge of what is truly good; it takes\n",
      "a fine and well-grounded character to react immediately with the\n",
      "right approvals and condemnations. And to this statement must\n",
      "be added two qualifications. One is that even the good man can\n",
      "trust for enlightenment to his direct responses of values only in\n",
      "simpler situations, in those which are already upon the whole\n",
      "familiar. The better he is, the more likely he is to be perplexed as to\n",
      "what to do in novel, complicated situations. Then the only way\n",
      "out is through examination, inquiry, turning things over in his\n",
      "mind till something presents itself, perhaps after prolonged\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "mental fermentation, to which he can directly react. The other\n",
      "qualification is that there is no such thing as a good man—in an\n",
      "absolute sense. Immediate appreciation is liable to be warped by\n",
      "many considerations which can be detected and uprooted only\n",
      "through inquiry and criticism. To be completely good and an\n",
      "infallible judge of right a man would have had to live from infancy\n",
      "in a thoroughly good social medium free from all limiting and\n",
      "distorting influences. As it is, habits of liking and disliking are\n",
      "formed early in life, prior to ability to use discriminating\n",
      "intelligence. Prejudices, unconscious biases, are generated; one is\n",
      "uneven in his distribution of esteem and admiration; he is unduly\n",
      "sensitive to some values, relatively indifferent to others. He is\n",
      "set in his ways, and his immediate appreciations travel in the\n",
      "grooves laid down by his unconsciously formed habits. Hence\n",
      "the spontaneous \"intuitions\" of value have to be entertained\n",
      "subject to correction, to confirmation and revision, by personal\n",
      "observation of consequences and cross-questioning of their\n",
      "quality and scope.\n",
      "§ 4. Conscience and Deliberation\n",
      "The usual name for this process is deliberation; the\n",
      "name given moral deliberativeness when it is habitual is\n",
      "conscientiousness. This quality is constituted by scrupulous\n",
      "attentiveness to the potentialities of any act or proposed aim. Its\n",
      "possession is a characteristic of those who do not allow themselves\n",
      "to be unduly swayed by immediate appetite and passion, nor to\n",
      "fall into ruts of routine behavior. The \"good\" man who rests on\n",
      "his oars, who permits himself to be propelled simply by the\n",
      "momentum of his attained right habits, loses alertness; he ceases to\n",
      "be on the lookout. With that loss, his goodness drops away from\n",
      "him. There is, indeed, a quality called \"overconscientiousness,\"\n",
      "but it is not far from a vice. It signifies constant anxiety as to\n",
      "whether one is really good or not, a moral \"self-consciousness\"\n",
      "which spells embarrassment, constraint in action, morbid fear. It\n",
      "is a caricature of genuine conscientiousness. For the latter is not\n",
      "an anxious prying into motives, a fingering of the inner springs\n",
      "of action to detect whether or not a \"motive\" is good. Genuine\n",
      "conscientiousness has an objective outlook; it is intelligent\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "attention and care to the quality of an act in view of its consequences\n",
      "for general happiness; it is not anxious solicitude for one's own\n",
      "virtuous state.\n",
      "Perhaps the most striking difference between immediate\n",
      "sensitiveness, or \"intuition,\" and \"conscientiousness\" as reflective\n",
      "interest, is that the former tends to rest upon the plane of achieved\n",
      "goods, while the latter is on the outlook for something better.\n",
      "The truly conscientious person not only uses a standard in\n",
      "judging, but is concerned to revise and improve his standard. He\n",
      "realizes that the value resident in acts goes beyond anything which\n",
      "he has already apprehended, and that therefore there must be\n",
      "something inadequate in any standard which has been definitely\n",
      "formulated. He is on the lookout for good not already achieved.\n",
      "Only by thoughtfulness does one become sensitive to the far-\n",
      "reaching implications of an act; apart from continual reflection\n",
      "we are at best sensitive only to the value of special and limited\n",
      "ends.\n",
      "The larger and remoter values of an act form what is\n",
      "ordinarily termed an ideal. About nothing, perhaps, is\n",
      "misconception more current than as to the nature of ideals. They are\n",
      "thought of sometimes as fixed, remote goals, too far away to be\n",
      "ever realized in conduct and sometimes as vague emotional\n",
      "inspirations which take the place of thought in directing conduct.\n",
      "Thus the \"idealist\" is thought of as either an impractical person,\n",
      "concerned with the unattainable, or else as a person who is\n",
      "moved by aspirations for something intangible of a vague\n",
      "spiritual sort having no concrete reference to actual situations. The\n",
      "trouble with ideals of remote \"perfection\" is that they tend to\n",
      "make us negligent of the significance of the special situations in\n",
      "which we have to act; they are thought of as trivial in\n",
      "comparison with the ideal of perfection. The genuine ideal, on the\n",
      "contrary, is the sense that each of these special situations brings\n",
      "with it its own inexhaustible meaning, that its value reaches far\n",
      "beyond its direct local existence. Its nature is perhaps best\n",
      "expressed in the verses of George Herbert:\n",
      "Who sweeps a room as for Thy Laws\n",
      "Makes that and th' action fine.\n",
      "As we have said, reflection when directed to practical matters,\n",
      "to determination of what to do, is called deliberation. A general\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "deliberates upon the conduct of a campaign, weighing possible\n",
      "moves of the enemy and of his own troops, considering pros and\n",
      "cons; a business man deliberates in comparing various modes of\n",
      "investment; a lawyer deliberates upon the conduct of his case,\n",
      "and so on. In all cases of deliberation, judgment of value enters;\n",
      "the one who engages in it is concerned to weigh values with a\n",
      "view to discovering the better and rejecting the worse. In some\n",
      "cases, the value of ends is thought of and in other cases the value\n",
      "of means. Moral deliberation differs from other forms not as a\n",
      "process of forming a judgment and arriving at knowledge but in\n",
      "the kind of value which is thought about. The value is technical,\n",
      "professional, economic, etc., as long as one thinks of it as\n",
      "something which one can aim at and attain by way of having,\n",
      "possessing; as something to be got or to be missed. Precisely the same\n",
      "object will have a moral value when it is thought of as making a\n",
      "difference in the self, as determining what one will be, instead of\n",
      "merely what one will have. Deliberation involves doubt,\n",
      "hesitation, the need of making up one's mind, of arriving at a decisive\n",
      "choice. The choice at stake in a moral deliberation or valuation is\n",
      "the worth of this and that kind of character and disposition.\n",
      "Deliberation is not then to be identified with calculation, or a quasi-\n",
      "mathematical reckoning of profit and loss. Such calculation\n",
      "assumes that the nature of the self does not enter into question, but\n",
      "only how much the self is going to get of this and that. Moral\n",
      "deliberation deals not with quantity of value but with quality.\n",
      "We estimate the import or significance of any present desire or\n",
      "impulse by forecasting what it will come or amount to if carried\n",
      "out; literally its consequences define its consequence, its meaning\n",
      "or import. But if these consequences are conceived merely as\n",
      "remote, if their picturing does not arouse a present sense of peace,\n",
      "of fulfillment, or of dissatisfaction, of incompletion and\n",
      "irritation, the process of thinking out consequences remains purely\n",
      "intellectual. It is as barren of influence upon behavior as the\n",
      "mathematical speculations of a disembodied angel. Any actual\n",
      "experience of reflection upon conduct will show that every\n",
      "foreseen result at once stirs our present affections, our likes and\n",
      "dislikes, our desires and aversions. There is developed a running\n",
      "commentary which stamps objects at once as good or evil. It is\n",
      "this direct sense of value, not the consciousness of general rules\n",
      "or ultimate goals, which finally determines the worth of the act\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "to the agent. Here is an inexpugnable element of truth in the\n",
      "intuitional theory. Its error lies in conceiving this immediate\n",
      "response of appreciation as if it excluded reflection instead of\n",
      "following directly upon its heels. Deliberation is actually an\n",
      "imaginative rehearsal of various courses of conduct. We give\n",
      "way, in our mind, to some impulse; we try, in our mind, some\n",
      "plan. Following its career through various steps, we find\n",
      "ourselves in imagination in the presence of the consequences that\n",
      "would follow: and as we then like and approve, or dislike and\n",
      "disapprove, these consequences, we find the original impulse or\n",
      "plan good or bad. Deliberation is dramatic and active, not\n",
      "mathematical and impersonal; and hence it has the intuitive, the\n",
      "direct factor in it. The advantage of a mental trial, prior to the\n",
      "overt trial (for the act after all is itself also a trial, a proving of\n",
      "the idea that lies back of it), is that it is retrievable, whereas overt\n",
      "consequences remain. They cannot be recalled. Moreover, many\n",
      "trials may mentally be made in a short time. The imagining of\n",
      "various plans carried out furnishes an opportunity for many\n",
      "impulses which at first are not in evidence at all, to get under way.\n",
      "Many and varied direct sensings, appreciations, take place. When\n",
      "many tendencies are brought into play, there is clearly much\n",
      "greater probability that the capacity of self which is really needed\n",
      "and appropriate will be brought into action, and thus a truly\n",
      "reasonable happiness result. The tendency of deliberation to\n",
      "\"polarize\" the various lines of activity into opposed alternatives, into\n",

      "It is clear that the various situations in which a person is\n",
      "called to deliberate and judge have common elements, and that\n",
      "values found in them resemble one another. It is also obvious\n",
      "that general ideas are a great aid in judging particular cases. If\n",
      "different situations were wholly unlike one another, nothing\n",
      "could be learned from one which would be of any avail in any\n",
      "other. But having like points, experience carries over from one to\n",
      "another, and experience is intellectually cumulative. Out of\n",
      "resembling experiences general ideas develop; through language,\n",

      "instruction, and tradition this gathering together of experiences\n",
      "of value into generalized points of view is extended to take in a\n",
      "whole people and a race. Through intercommunication the\n",
      "experience of the entire human race is to some extent pooled and\n",
      "crystallized in general ideas. These ideas constitute principles.\n",
      "We bring them with us to deliberation on particular situations.\n",
      "These generalized points of view are of great use in surveying\n",
      "particular cases. But as they are transmitted from one generation\n",
      "to another, they tend to become fixed and rigid. Their origin in\n",
      "experience is forgotten and so is their proper use in further\n",
      "experience. They are thought of as if they existed in and of\n",
      "themselves and as if it were simply a question of bringing action under\n",
      "them in order to determine what is right and good. Instead of\n",
      "being treated as aids and instruments in judging values as the\n",
      "latter actually arise, they are made superior to them. They become\n",
      "prescriptions, rules. Now a genuine principle differs from a rule\n",
      "in two ways: (a) A principle evolves in connection with the\n",
      "course of experience, being a generalized statement of what sort\n",
      "of consequences and values tend to be realized in certain kinds of\n",
      "situations; a rule is taken as something ready-made and fixed.\n",
      "(b) A principle is primarily intellectual, a method and scheme for\n",
      "judging, and is practical secondarily because of what it discloses;\n",
      "a rule is primarily practical.\n",
      "Suppose that one is convinced that the rule of honesty is made\n",
      "known just in and of itself by a special faculty, and has\n",
      "absolutely nothing to do with recollection of past cases or forecast of\n",
      "possible future circumstances. How would such a rule apply\n",
      "itself to any particular case which needed to be judged? What bell\n",
      "would ring, what signal would be given, to indicate that just this\n",
      "case is the appropriate case for the application of the rule of\n",
      "honest dealing? And if by some miracle this question were answered,\n",
      "if we could know that here is a case for the rule of honesty, how\n",
      "should we know just what course in detail the rule calls for? For\n",
      "the rule, to be applicable to all cases, must omit the conditions\n",
      "which differentiate one case from another; it must contain only\n",
      "the very few similar elements which are to be found in all honest\n",

      "given case.\n",
      "This difficulty is so serious that all systems which have\n",
      "committed themselves to belief in a number of hard and fast rules\n",
      "having their origin in conscience, or in the word of God\n",
      "impressed upon the human soul or externally revealed, always have\n",
      "had to resort to a more and more complicated procedure to\n",
      "cover, if possible, all the cases. The moral life is finally reduced\n",

      "uncertainties which inevitably arise under such circumstances, Casuistry\n",
      "is built up (from the Latin casus, case). The attempt is made to\n",

      "Dangers and evils attend this way of conceiving the moral life.\n",
      "(a) It tends to magnify the letter of morality at the expense of its\n",

      "(b) This ethical system also tends in practice to a legal view of\n",

      "legal ideas into morality. In the legal view liability to blame and\n",
      "to punishment inflicted from without by some superior\n",
      "authority, is necessarily prominent. Conduct is regulated through\n",
      "specific injunctions and prohibitions: Do this, Do not do that.\n",
      "Exactly the sort of analysis of which we have spoken above (p. 277)\n",
      "in the case of killing is necessary, so that there may be definite\n",

      "(especially for the conscientious who take it seriously) to a more\n",
      "or less anxious and servile conformity to externally imposed\n",
      "rules. Obedience as loyalty to principle is a good, but this scheme\n",
      "practically makes it the only good and conceives it not as loyalty\n",
      "to ideals, but as conformity to commands. Moral rules exist just\n",
      "as independent deliverances on their own account, and the right\n",

      "fail to see that such evils are logically connected with any\n",

      "responsible for what they object to in the scheme; while they still cling\n",
      "to the idea that morality is an effort to apply to particular deeds\n",

      "notion of absolute rules or precepts cannot be made workable\n",
      "except through certain superior authorities who declare and\n",
      "enforce them. Said Locke: \"It is no small power it gives one man\n",

      "There is another practically harmful consequence which\n",
      "follows from the identification of principles with rules. Take the\n",

      "government, private or public ownership of public utilities,\n",
      "communal versus private property, shows that persons of equally\n",
      "well-meaning dispositions find that justice means opposite things\n",
      "in practice, although all proclaim themselves devoted to justice\n",
      "as the rule of action. Taken as a principle, not as a rule,\n",
      "justice signifies the will to examine specific institutions and\n",
      "measures so as to find out how they operate with the view of\n",

      "the nature of true moral principles. Rules are practical; they are\n",
      "habitual ways of doing things. But principles are intellectual;\n",
      "they are the final methods used in judging suggested courses of\n",
      "action. The fundamental error of the intuitionalist is that he is on\n",
      "the outlook for rules which will of themselves tell agents just\n",
      "what course of action to pursue; whereas the object of moral\n",
      "principles is to supply standpoints and methods which will\n",
      "enable the individual to make for himself an analysis of the\n",
      "elements of good and evil in the particular situation in which he\n",
      "finds himself. No genuine moral principle prescribes a specific\n",
      "course of action; rules, Of course, the word \"rule\" is often used to designate a principle—as in the\n",
      "case of the phrase \"Golden Rule.\" We are speaking not of the words, but of\n",
      "their underlying ideas.\n",
      "1 like cooking recipes, may tell just what\n",
      "to do and how to do it. A moral principle, such as that of\n",
      "chastity, of justice, of the Golden Rule, gives the agent a basis for\n",
      "looking at and examining a particular question that comes up. It\n",
      "holds before him certain possible aspects of the act; it warns him\n",
      "against taking a short or partial view of the act. It economizes\n",
      "his thinking by supplying him with the main heads by reference\n",
      "to which to consider the bearings of his desires and purposes; it\n",
      "guides him in his thinking by suggesting to him the important\n",
      "considerations for which he should be on the lookout.\n",
      "A moral principle, then, is not a command to act or forbear\n",
      "acting in a given way: it is a tool for analyzing a special situation,\n",
      "the right or wrong being determined by the situation in its\n",
      "entirety, and not by the rule as such. We sometimes hear it stated,\n",
      "for example, that the universal adoption of the Golden Rule\n",
      "would at once settle all industrial disputes and difficulties. But\n",
      "suppose that the principle were accepted in good faith by\n",
      "everybody; it would not at once tell everybody just what to do in all\n",
      "the complexities of his relations to others. When individuals are\n",
      "still uncertain of what their real good may be, it does not finally\n",
      "decide matters to tell them to regard the good of others as they\n",
      "would their own. Nor does it mean that whatever in detail we\n",
      "want for ourselves we should strive to give to others. Because I\n",
      "am fond of classical music it does not follow that I should thrust\n",
      "as much of it as possible upon my neighbors. But the \"Golden\n",

      "the situations requiring intelligent deliberation.\n",
      "The same distinction is implied in what was brought out in the\n",

      "as an end and as a standard. If it were regarded as the direct end\n",
      "of acts, it might be taken to be something fixed and inflexible. As\n",
      "a standard it is rather a cautionary direction, saying that when\n",
      "we judge an act, accomplished or proposed, with reference to\n",
      "approval and disapproval, we should first consider its consequences\n",
      "in general, and then its special consequences with respect to\n",
      "whatever affects the well-being of others. As a standard it\n",
      "provides a consistent point of view to be taken in all deliberation,\n",
      "but it does not pretend to determine in advance precisely what\n",

      "open for discovery of new constituents of well-being, and for\n",
      "varying combinations of these constituents in different\n",
      "situations. If the standard were taken as a rule, in the sense of a\n",
      "recipe, it would signify that one comes to each case with a prior\n",
      "hard and fast, Procrustean, and complete conception of just and\n",
      "only what elements form happiness, so that this conception can\n",
      "be applied like a mathematical formula. \"Standards\" interpreted\n",
      "after this fashion breed self-righteousness, moral conceit, and\n",
      "fanaticism. The standard as a standpoint for survey of situations\n",
      "allows free play to the imagination in reaching new insights. It\n",
      "requires, rather than merely permits, continual advance in the\n",

      "§ 1. The Self and Choice\n",
      "The self has occupied a central place in the previous\n",
      "discussions, in which important aspects of the good self have been\n",
      "brought out. The self should be wise or prudent, looking to an\n",
      "inclusive satisfaction and hence subordinating the satisfaction of\n",
      "an immediately urgent single appetite; it should be faithful in\n",
      "acknowledgment of the claims involved in its relations with others;\n",
      "it should be solicitous, thoughtful, in the award of praise and\n",
      "blame, use of approbation and disapprobation, and, finally,\n",
      "should be conscientious and have the active will to discover new\n",
      "values and to revise former notions. We have not, however,\n",
      "examined just what is the significance of the self. The important\n",
      "position of the self in morals, and also various controversies of\n",
      "moral theory which have gathered about it, make such an\n",
      "examination advisable. A brief reference to the opposed theories will\n",
      "help to indicate the points which need special attention.\n",
      "A most profound line of cleavage has appeared in topics\n",
      "already discussed. Some theories hold that the self, apart from\n",
      "what it does, is the supreme and exclusive moral end. This view\n",
      "is contained in Kant's assertion that the Good Will, aside from\n",
      "consequences of acts performed, is the only Moral Good. A\n",
      "similar idea is implicit whenever moral goodness is identified in an\n",
      "exclusive way with virtue, so that the final aim of a good person\n",
      "is, when summed up briefly, to maintain his own virtue. When\n",
      "the self is assumed to be the end in an exclusive way, then\n",
      "conduct, acts, consequences, are all treated as mere means, as\n",
      "external instruments for maintaining the good self. The opposed\n",
      "point of view is found in the hedonism of the earlier utilitarians\n",
      "when they assert that a certain kind of consequences, pleasure, is\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the only good end and that the self and its qualities are mere\n",
      "means for producing these consequences.\n",
      "Our own theory gives both self and consequences\n",
      "indispensable roles. We have held, by implication, that neither one can be\n",
      "made to be merely a means to the other. There is a circular\n",
      "arrangement. The self is not a mere means to producing\n",
      "consequences because the consequences, when of a moral kind, enter\n",
      "into the formation of the self and the self enters into them. To\n",
      "use a somewhat mechanical analogy, bricks are means to\n",
      "building a house, but they are not mere means because they finally\n",
      "compose a part of the house itself; if being a part of the house\n",
      "then reacted to modify the nature of the bricks themselves the\n",
      "analogy would be quite adequate. Similarly, conduct and\n",
      "consequences are important, but instead of being separate from the\n",
      "self they form, reveal, and test the self. That which has just been\n",
      "stated in a formal way will be given concrete meaning if we\n",
      "consider the nature of choice, since choice is the most characteristic\n",
      "activity of a self.\n",
      "Prior to anything which may be called choice in the sense of\n",
      "deliberate decision come spontaneous selections or preferences.\n",
      "Every appetite and impulse, however blind, is a mode of\n",
      "preferring one thing to another; it selects one thing and rejects others.\n",
      "It goes out with attraction to certain objects, putting them ahead\n",
      "of others in value. The latter are neglected although from a\n",
      "purely external standpoint they are equally accessible and\n",
      "available. We are so constructed that both by original temperament\n",
      "and by acquired habit we move toward some objects rather than\n",
      "others. Such preference antecedes judgment of comparative\n",
      "values; it is organic rather than conscious. Afterwards there arise\n",
      "situations in which wants compete; we are drawn spontaneously\n",
      "in opposite directions. Incompatible preferences hold each other\n",
      "in check. We hesitate, and then hesitation becomes deliberation:\n",
      "that weighing of values in comparison with each other of which\n",
      "we have already spoken. At last, a preference emerges which is\n",
      "intentional and which is based on consciousness of the values\n",
      "which deliberation has brought into view. We have to make up\n",
      "our minds, when we want two conflicting things, which of them\n",
      "we really want. That is choice. We prefer spontaneously, we\n",
      "choose deliberately, knowingly.\n",
      "Now every such choice sustains a double relation to the self. It\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "reveals the existing self and it forms the future self. That which is\n",
      "chosen is that which is found congenial to the desires and habits\n",
      "of the self as it already exists. Deliberation has an important\n",
      "function in this process, because each different possibility as it is\n",
      "presented to the imagination appeals to a different element in the\n",
      "constitution of the self, thus giving all sides of character a chance\n",
      "to play their part in the final choice. The resulting choice also\n",
      "shapes the self, making it, in some degree, a new self. This fact is\n",
      "especially marked at critical junctures (p. 171), but it marks\n",
      "every choice to some extent however slight. Not all are as\n",
      "momentous as the choice of a calling in life, or of a life-partner. But\n",
      "every choice is at the forking of the roads, and the path chosen\n",
      "shuts off certain opportunities and opens others. In committing\n",
      "oneself to a particular course, a person gives a lasting set to his\n",
      "own being. Consequently, it is proper to say that in choosing this\n",
      "object rather than that, one is in reality choosing what kind of\n",
      "person or self one is going to be. Superficially, the deliberation\n",
      "which terminates in choice is concerned with weighing the values\n",
      "of particular ends. Below the surface, it is a process of\n",
      "discovering what sort of being a person most wants to become.\n",
      "Selfhood or character is thus not a mere means, an external\n",
      "instrument, of attaining certain ends. It is an agency of\n",
      "accomplishing consequences, as is shown in the pains which the\n",
      "athlete, the lawyer, the merchant, takes to build up certain habits in\n",
      "himself, because he knows they are the causal conditions for\n",
      "reaching the ends in which he is interested. But the self is more\n",
      "than an external causal agent. The attainment of consequences\n",
      "reacts to form the self. Moreover, as Aristotle said, the goodness\n",
      "of a good man shines through his deeds. We say of one another's\n",
      "conduct, \"How characteristic that was!\" In using such an\n",
      "expression we imply that the self is more than a cause of an act in\n",
      "the sense in which a match is a cause of a fire; we imply that the\n",
      "self has entered so intimately into the act performed as to qualify\n",
      "it. The self reveals its nature in what it chooses. In consequence a\n",
      "moral judgment upon an act is also a judgment upon the\n",
      "character or selfhood of the one doing the act. Every time we hold a\n",
      "person responsible for what he has done, we acknowledge in\n",
      "effect that a deed which can be judged morally has an intimate\n",
      "and internal connection with the character of the one from\n",
      "whom the deed issued. Metaphorically, we speak of the virtues\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "of a medicinal plant, meaning that it is efficient for producing\n",
      "certain effects which are wanted, but the virtuous dispositions of\n",
      "the self enter into what the self does and remain there, giving the\n",
      "act its special quality.\n",
      "If the earlier utilitarians erred in thinking that the self with its\n",
      "virtuous and vicious dispositions was of importance only as a\n",
      "means to certain consequences in which all genuine good and\n",
      "evil are found, the school which holds that consequences have no\n",
      "moral significance at all, and that only the self is morally good\n",
      "and bad, also falls into the error of separating the self and its\n",
      "acts. For goodness and badness could, on this theory, be\n",
      "attributed to the self apart from the results of its dispositions when\n",
      "the latter are put into operation. In truth, only that self is good\n",
      "which wants and strives energetically for good consequences;\n",
      "that is, those consequences which promote the well-being of\n",
      "those affected by the act. It is not too much to say that the key to\n",
      "a correct theory of morality is recognition of the essential unity\n",
      "of the self and its acts, if the latter have any moral significance;\n",
      "while errors in theory arise as soon as the self and acts (and their\n",
      "consequences) are separated from each other, and moral worth is\n",
      "attributed to one more than to the other.\n",
      "The unity of self and action underlies all judgment that is\n",
      "distinctively moral in character. We may judge a happening to be\n",
      "useful or harmful in its consequences, as when we speak of a\n",
      "kindly rain or a destructive torrent. We do not, however, imply\n",
      "moral valuation, because we do not impute connection with\n",
      "character or with a self to rain or flood. On similar grounds, we\n",
      "do not attribute moral quality to acts of an infant, an imbecile or\n",
      "a madman. Yet there comes a time in the life of a normal child\n",
      "when his acts are morally judged. Nevertheless, this fact does not\n",
      "imply, necessarily, that he deliberately intended to produce just\n",
      "the consequences which occurred. It is enough if the judgment is\n",
      "a factor in forming a self from which future acts deliberately,\n",
      "intentionally, proceed. A child snatches at food because he is\n",
      "hungry. He is told that he is rude or greedy—a moral judgment.\n",
      "Yet the only thing in the child's mind may have been that the\n",
      "food taken would satisfy hunger. To him the act had no moral\n",
      "import. In calling him rude and greedy, the parent has made a\n",
      "connection between something in himself and a certain quality\n",
      "in his act. The act was performed in a way which discloses\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "something undesirable in the self. If the act be passed without notice,\n",
      "that tendency will be strengthened; the self will be shaped in that\n",
      "direction. On the other hand, if the child can be brought to see\n",
      "the connection, the intimate unity, of his own being and the\n",
      "obnoxious quality of the act, his self will take on another form.\n",
      "§ 2. The Self and Motivation: Interests\n",
      "The identity of self and an act, morally speaking, is the\n",
      "key to understanding the nature of motives and motivation.\n",
      "Unless this unity is perceived and acknowledged in theory, a motive\n",
      "will be regarded as something external acting upon an individual\n",
      "and inducing him to do something. When this point of view is\n",
      "generalized, it leads to the conclusion that the self is naturally,\n",
      "intrinsically, inert and passive, and so has to be stirred or moved\n",
      "to action by something outside itself. The fact, however, is that\n",
      "the self, like its vital basis the organism, is always active; that it\n",
      "acts by its very constitution, and hence needs no external\n",
      "promise of reward or threat of evil to induce it to act. This fact is a\n",
      "confirmation of the moral unity of self and action.\n",
      "Observation of a child, even a young baby, will convince the\n",
      "observer that a normal human being when awake is engaged in\n",
      "activity; he is a reservoir of energy that is continually\n",
      "overflowing. The organism moves, reaches, handles, pulls, pounds, tears,\n",
      "molds, crumples, looks, listens, etc. It is continually, while\n",
      "awake, exploring its surroundings and establishing new contacts\n",
      "and relations. Periods of quiescence and rest are of course needed\n",
      "for recuperation. But nothing is more intolerable to a healthy\n",
      "human being than enforced passivity over a long period. It is not\n",
      "action that needs to be accounted for, but rather the cessation of\n",
      "activity.\n",
      "As was intimated earlier in another context, this fact is fatal to\n",
      "a hedonistic psychology (p. 194). Since we act before we have\n",
      "experience of pleasures and pains, since the latter follow as\n",
      "results of action, it cannot possibly be true that desire for pleasure\n",
      "is the source of conduct. The implications of the fact extend,\n",
      "moreover, to the entire concept of motivation. The theory that a\n",
      "motive is an inducement which operates from without upon the\n",
      "self confuses motive and stimulus. Stimuli from the environment\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "are highly important factors in conduct. But they are not\n",
      "important as causes, as generators of action. For the organism is\n",
      "already active, and stimuli themselves arise and are experienced\n",
      "only in the course of action. The painful heat of an object\n",
      "stimulates the hand to withdraw but the heat was experienced in the\n",
      "course of reaching and exploring. The function of a stimulus\n",
      "is—as the case just cited illustrates—to change the direction of\n",
      "an action already going on. Similarly, a response to a stimulus is\n",
      "not the beginning of activity; it is a change, a shift, of activity in\n",
      "response to the change in conditions indicated by a stimulus.\n",
      "A navigator of a ship perceives a headland; this may operate to\n",
      "make him alter the course which his ship takes. But it is not the\n",
      "cause or \"moving spring\" of his sailing. Motives, like stimuli,\n",
      "induce us to alter the trend and course of our conduct, but they do\n",
      "not evoke or originate action as such.\n",
      "The term \"motive\" is thus ambiguous. It means (1) those\n",
      "interests which form the core of the self and supply the principles\n",
      "by which conduct is to be understood. It also (2) signifies the\n",
      "objects, whether perceived or thought of, which effect an alteration\n",
      "in the direction of activity. Unless we bear in mind the\n",
      "connection between these two meanings along with the fundamental\n",
      "character of the first signification, we shall have a wrong\n",
      "conception of the relation of the self to conduct, and this original error\n",
      "will generate error in all parts of ethical theory.\n",
      "Any concrete case of the union of the self in action with an\n",
      "object and end is called an interest. Children form the interest of\n",
      "a parent; painting or music is the interest of an artist; the\n",
      "concern of a judge is the equable settling of legal disputes; healing\n",
      "of the sick is the interest of a physician. An interest is, in short,\n",
      "the dominant direction of activity, and in this activity desire is\n",
      "united with an object to be furthered in a decisive choice. Unless\n",
      "impulse and desire are enlisted, one has no heart for a course of\n",
      "conduct; one is indifferent, averse, not-interested. On the other\n",
      "hand, an interest is objective; the heart is set on something.\n",
      "There is no interest at large or in a vacuum; each interest\n",
      "imperatively demands an object to which it is attached and for the well-\n",
      "being or development of which it is actively solicitous. If a man\n",
      "says he is interested in pictures, he asserts that he cares for them;\n",
      "if he does not go near them, if he takes no pains to create\n",
      "opportunities for viewing and studying them, his actions so belie his\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "words that we know his interest is merely nominal. Interest is\n",
      "regard, concern, solicitude, for an object; if it is not manifested in\n",
      "action it is unreal.\n",
      "A motive is not then a drive to action, or something which\n",
      "moves to doing something. It is the movement of the self as a\n",
      "whole, a movement in which desire is integrated with an object\n",
      "so completely as to be chosen as a compelling end. The hungry\n",
      "person seeks food. We may say, if we please, that he is moved by\n",
      "hunger. But in fact hunger is only a name for the tendency to\n",
      "move toward the appropriation of food. To create an entity out\n",
      "of this active relation of the self to objects, and then to treat this\n",
      "abstraction as if it were the cause of seeking food is sheer\n",
      "confusion. The case is no different when we say that a man is moved\n",
      "by kindness, or mercy, or cruelty, or malice. These things are not\n",
      "independent powers which stir to action. They are designations\n",
      "of the kind of active union or integration which exists between\n",
      "the self and a class of objects. It is the man himself in his very self\n",
      "who is malicious or kindly, and these adjectives signify that the\n",
      "self is so constituted as to act in certain ways towards certain\n",
      "objects. Benevolence or cruelty is not something which a man has,\n",
      "as he may have dollars in his pocket-book; it is something which\n",
      "he is; and since his being is active, these qualities are modes of\n",
      "activity, not forces which produce action.\n",
      "Because an interest or motive is the union in action of a need,\n",
      "desire of a self, with a chosen object, the object itself may, in a\n",
      "secondary and derived sense, be said to be the motive of action.\n",
      "Thus a bribe may be called the motive which induces a legislator\n",
      "to vote for a particular measure, or profit-making may be called\n",
      "the motive a grocer has for giving just weights. It is clear,\n",
      "however, that it is the person's own make-up which gives the bribe,\n",
      "or the hoped for gain, its hold over him. The avaricious man is\n",
      "stirred to action by objects which mean nothing to a generous\n",
      "person; a frank and open character is moved by objects which\n",
      "would only repel a person of a sly and crafty disposition. A\n",
      "legislator is tempted by a bribe to vote against conviction only\n",
      "because his selfhood is already such that money gain has more\n",
      "value to him than convictions and principles. It is true enough\n",
      "when we take the whole situation into account that an object\n",
      "moves a person; for that object as a moving force includes the\n",
      "self within it. Error arises when we think of the object as if it\n",

      "which then operates to move the foreign self.\n",
      "The secondary and derived sense that identifies \"motive\" with\n",

      "mistake in thinking of these objects which call out a change in\n",
      "the direction of action as if they were \"motives\" in the sense of\n",
      "originating movement or action. That theory logically terminates\n",

      "the motivation of moral action; discussion has been confused\n",
      "because of failure to examine the underlying problem of the\n",

      "either one's own good or that of others. They are rather direct\n",
      "responses to situations. As far as self-love is concerned, the case\n",
      "is well stated by James. He says: \"When I am moved by self-love\n",
      "to keep my seat whilst ladies stand, or grab something first and\n",
      "cut out my neighbor, what I really love is the seat; it is the thing\n",

      "fatally provokes the 'selfish' response. . . . In fact the more\n",
      "thoroughly selfish I am in this primitive way, the more blindly\n",
      "absorbed my thought will be in the objects and impulses of my lust\n",

      "selfish, as in the case of the reaction of a parent to the child's\n",
      "grabbing of food. But in the beginning, this response signifies\n",
      "that the act is one which is socially objected to, so that reproof\n",

      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "different values. A self changes its structure and its value according to\n",
      "the kind of object which it desires and seeks; according, that is,\n",
      "to the different kinds of objects in which active interest is taken.\n",
      "The identity of self and act, the central point in moral theory,\n",
      "operates in two directions. It applies to the interpretation of the\n",
      "quality and value of the act and to that of the self. It is absurd to\n",
      "suppose that the difference between the good person and the bad\n",
      "person is that the former has no interest or deep and intimate\n",
      "concern (leading to personal intimate satisfaction) in what he\n",
      "does, while the bad person is one who does have a personal stake\n",
      "in his actions. What makes the difference between the two is the\n",
      "quality of the interest that characterizes them. For the quality of\n",
      "the interest is dependent upon the nature of the object which\n",
      "arouses it and to which it is attached, being trivial, momentous;\n",
      "narrow, wide; transient, enduring; exclusive, inclusive in exact\n",
      "accord with the object. When it is assumed that because a person\n",
      "acts from an interest, in and because its fulfillment brings\n",
      "satisfaction and happiness, he therefore always acts selfishly, the\n",
      "fallacy lies in supposing that there is a separation between the self\n",
      "and the end pursued. If there were, the so-called end would in\n",
      "fact be only a means to bringing some profit or advantage to the\n",
      "self. Now this sort of thing does happen. A man may use his\n",
      "friends, for example, simply as aids to his own personal\n",
      "advancement in his profession. But in this case, he is not interested in\n",
      "them as friends or even as human beings on their own account.\n",
      "He is interested in what he can get out of them; calling them\n",
      "\"friends\" is a fraudulent pretense. In short, the essence of the\n",
      "whole distinction between selfishness and unselfishness lies in\n",
      "what sort of object the self is interested. \"Disinterested\" action\n",
      "does not signify uninterested; when it has this meaning, action is\n",
      "apathetic, dull, routine, easily discouraged. The only intelligible\n",
      "meaning that can be given to \"disinterested\" is that interest is\n",
      "intellectually fair, impartial, counting the same thing as of the\n",
      "same value whether it affects my welfare or that of some one else.\n",
      "So far we have been dealing with cases wherein action\n",
      "manifests and forms the self. In some of these cases the thought of the\n",
      "self definitely influences the passage of desire into choice and\n",
      "action. Thus we may say of an act that it manifests self-respect, or\n",
      "that it shows the agent to have no longer any sense of shame. The\n",
      "use of such terms as self-respect, sense of dignity, shame, in\n",
      "approbation is enough to show that conduct is not of necessity\n",

      "worse because the thought of self is a weighty factor in deciding\n",
      "what to do. When, however, we attribute an act to conceit or to\n",
      "false pride we disapprove. The conclusion, obviously, is that\n",
      "the issue is not whether the thought of self is a factor or not,\n",
      "but what kind of self is thought of, and in what way, to what\n",
      "purpose. Even \"self-respect\" is a somewhat ambiguous term. It\n",
      "may denote a sense of the dignity inhering in personality as such,\n",
      "a sense which restrains from doing acts which would besmirch it.\n",
      "It may mean respect for one's personal standing or repute in\n",
      "a community. Again, it may mean attachment to the family\n",
      "name which one bears, or a pride in some personal past\n",
      "achievement which one feels one must live up to. In the latter forms, it\n",
      "may be a definite support and safeguard to wise choice, or it may\n",
      "become a pretentious and hollow sham. It all depends, not on\n",
      "the general name employed, but on the constituents of the\n",
      "particular case. About the only general proposition which can be laid\n",
      "down is that the principle of equity and fairness should rule. The\n",
      "dividing line between, say, genuine and \"false\" pride is fixed by\n",
      "the equality or inequality of weight attached to the thought of\n",
      "one's own self in comparison with other selves. It is a matter\n",
      "of the intellectual attitude of objectivity and impartiality. The\n",
      "trouble with conceit, vanity, etc., is their warping influence on\n",
      "judgment. But humility, modesty, may be just as bad, since they\n",
      "too may destroy balance and equity of judgment.\n",
      "Regard for others like regard for self has a double meaning. It\n",
      "may signify that action as a matter of fact contributes to the\n",
      "good of others, or it may mean that the thought of others' good\n",
      "enters as a determining factor into the conscious aim. In general,\n",
      "conduct, even on the conscious plane, is judged in terms of the\n",
      "elements of situations without explicit reference either to others\n",
      "or to oneself. The scholar, artist, physician, engineer, carries on\n",
      "the great part of his work without consciously asking himself\n",
      "whether his work is going to benefit himself or some one else. He\n",
      "is interested in the work itself; such objective interest is a\n",
      "condition of mental and moral health. It would be hard to imagine\n",
      "a situation of a more sickly sort than that in which a person\n",
      "thought that every act performed had to be actuated consciously\n",
      "by regard for the welfare of others; we should suspect the\n",

      "the immediate impulse is a sympathetic one. There is a strong\n",
      "natural impulse of resentment against an individual who is guilty\n",
      "of anti-social acts, and a feeling that retributive punishment of\n",
      "such a person is necessarily in the social interest. But the\n",
      "criterion of the interest actually served lies in its consequences, and\n",
      "there can be no doubt that much punishment, although felt to be\n",
      "in the interest of social justice, fosters a callous indifference to\n",
      "the common good, or even instills a desire in the one punished to\n",

      "results, that he is weakening the character of others, and, while\n",
      "helping them superficially, is harming them fundamentally.\n",
      "Such statements do not signify, of course, that a passion for\n",
      "justice or the emotion of pity should be suppressed. But just as\n",
      "the moral change in the person who thoughtlessly grabs\n",
      "something he wants is an expansion of interest to the thought of a\n",
      "wider circle of objects, so with the impulses which lie at the\n",
      "other pole. It is not easy to convert an immediate emotion into\n",
      "an interest, for the operation requires that we seek out indirect\n",
      "and subtle relations and consequences. But unless an emotion,\n",
      "whether labeled selfish or altruistic, is thus broadened, there is\n",
      "no reflective morality. To give way without thought to a kindly\n",
      "feeling is easy; to suppress it is easy for many persons; the\n",
      "difficult but needed thing is to retain it in all its pristine intensity\n",
      "while directing it, as a precondition of action, into channels of\n",
      "thought. A union of benevolent impulse and intelligent reflection\n",
      "is the interest most likely to result in conduct that is good. But in\n",
      "this union the role of thoughtful inquiry is quite as important as\n",

      "selves. To a large extent, the emphasis of theory upon the\n",
      "problem of adjustment of egoism and altruism took place in a time\n",
      "when thought was decidedly individualistic in character. Theory\n",
      "was formed in terms of individuals supposed to be naturally\n",
      "isolated; social arrangements were considered to be secondary and\n",
      "artificial. Under such intellectual conditions, it was almost\n",
      "inevitable that moral theory should become preoccupied with the\n",
      "question of egoistic versus altruistic motivation. Since the\n",
      "prevailing individualism was expressed in an economic theory and\n",
      "practice which taught that each man was actuated by an\n",
      "exclusive regard for his own profit, moralists were led to insist\n",
      "upon the need of some check upon this ruthless individualism,\n",
      "and to accentuate the supremacy in morals (as distinct from\n",
      "business) of sympathy and benevolent regard for others. The\n",
      "ultimate significance of this appeal is, however, to make us realize\n",
      "the fact that regard for self and regard for others are both of\n",

      "in it, rather than by an adjustment of egoism and altruism.\n",
      "Similar illustrations are found in business, professional, and political\n",

      "The ethical problems connected with the fact of\n",
      "selfhood culminate in the ideas of responsibility and freedom. Both\n",
      "ideas are bound up with far-reaching issues which have\n",
      "produced great controversy in metaphysics and religion as well as in\n",
      "morals. We shall consider them only with respect to the points in\n",
      "which these concepts are definitely connected with the analysis\n",
      "which precedes. So considered, an important side of\n",
      "responsibility has been already touched upon in connection with the\n",
      "transformation of native and psychological tendencies into traits of a\n",
      "self having moral significance and value.\n",
      "Social demands and social approvals and condemnations are\n",
      "important factors in bringing about this change, as we had\n",
      "occasion to notice (p. 288). The point which is important is that they\n",
      "be used to produce a change in the attitude of those who are\n",
      "subject to them, especially the intellectual change of recognizing\n",
      "relations and meanings not hitherto associated with what they do.\n",
      "Now the commonest mistake in connection with the idea of\n",
      "responsibility consists in supposing that approval and reprobation\n",
      "have a retrospective instead of prospective bearing. The\n",
      "possibility of a desirable modification of character and the selection\n",
      "of the course of action which will make that possibility a reality\n",
      "is the central fact in responsibility. The child, for example, is at\n",
      "first held liable for what he has done, not because he deliberately\n",
      "and knowingly intended such action, but in order that in the\n",
      "future he may take into account bearings and consequences which\n",
      "he has failed to consider in what he has done. Here is where the\n",
      "human agent differs from a stone and inanimate thing, and\n",
      "indeed from animals lower in the scale.\n",
      "It would be absurd to hold a stone responsible when it falls\n",
      "from a cliff and injures a person, or to blame the falling tree\n",
      "which crushes a passer-by. The reason for the absurdity is that\n",
      "such treatment would have and could have no conceivable\n",
      "influence on the future behavior of stone or tree. They do not interact\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "with conditions about them so as to learn, so as to modify their\n",
      "attitudes and dispositions. A human being is held accountable in\n",
      "order that he may learn; in order that he may learn not\n",
      "theoretically and academically but in such a way as to modify\n",
      "and—to some extent—remake his prior self. The question of\n",
      "whether he might when he acted have acted differently from the\n",
      "way in which he did act is irrelevant. The question is whether he\n",
      "is capable of acting differently next time; the practical\n",
      "importance of effecting changes in human character is what makes\n",
      "responsibility important. Babes, imbeciles, the insane are not held\n",
      "accountable, because there is incapacity to learn and to change.\n",
      "With every increase of capacity to learn, there develops a larger\n",
      "degree of accountability. The fact that one did not deliberate\n",
      "before the performance of an act which brought injury to others,\n",
      "that he did not mean or intend the act, is of no significance, save\n",
      "as it may throw light upon the kind of response by others which\n",
      "will render him likely to deliberate next time he acts under\n",
      "similar circumstances. The fact that each act tends to form, through\n",
      "habit, a self which will perform a certain kind of acts, is the\n",
      "foundation, theoretically and practically of responsibility. We\n",
      "cannot undo the past; we can affect the future.\n",
      "Hence responsibility in relation to control of our reactions to\n",
      "the conduct of others is twofold. The persons who employ praise\n",
      "and blame, reward and punishment, are responsible for the\n",
      "selection of those methods which will, with the greatest probability,\n",
      "modify in a desirable way the future attitude and conduct of\n",
      "others. There is no inherent principle of retributive justice that\n",
      "commands and justifies the use of reward and punishment\n",
      "independently of their consequences in each specific case. To appeal to\n",
      "such a principle when punishment breeds callousness, rebellion,\n",
      "ingenuity in evasion, etc., is but a method of refusing to\n",
      "acknowledge responsibility. Now the consequence which is most\n",
      "important is that which occurs in personal attitude:\n",
      "confirmation of a good habit, change in a bad tendency.\n",
      "The point at which theories about responsibility go wrong is\n",
      "the attempt to base it upon a state of things which precedes\n",
      "holding a person liable, instead of upon what ensues in consequence\n",
      "of it. One is held responsible in order that he may become\n",

      "Otherwise they are themselves irresponsible in their own conduct. The\n",

      "important safeguard and directive force in growth.\n",

      "discussions by misconceptions of the nature of responsibility.\n",
      "Those who have sought for an antecedent basis of and warrant\n",
      "for responsibility have usually located it in \"freedom of the will,\"\n",
      "and have construed this freedom to signify an unmotivated power\n",
      "of choice, that is an arbitrary power to choose for no reason\n",
      "whatever except that the will does choose in this fashion. It is\n",
      "argued that there is no justice in holding a person liable for his\n",
      "act unless he might equally have done otherwise—completely\n",

      "his future conduct. A man might have \"acted otherwise than he\n",
      "did act\" if he had been a different kind of person, and the point\n",
      "in holding him liable for what he did do (and for being the kind\n",

      "connected with possibility of growth, learning and modification of\n",
      "character, just as is responsibility. The chief reason we do not\n",
      "think of a stone as free is because it is not capable of changing its\n",
      "mode of conduct, of purposely readapting itself to new\n",
      "conditions. An animal such as a dog shows plasticity; it acquires new\n",

      "the other hand, even a young child, not only learns but is capable\n",
      "of being interested in learning, interested in acquiring new\n",
      "attitudes and dispositions. As we mature we usually acquire habits\n",
      "that are settled to the point of routine. But unless and until we\n",

      "constantly in experience, that we can and do learn, and that the\n",
      "learning is not limited to acquisition of additional information\n",
      "but extends to remaking old tendencies. As far as a person\n",
      "becomes a different self or character he develops different desires\n",
      "and choices. Freedom in the practical sense develops when one is\n",
      "aware of this possibility and takes an interest in converting it\n",
      "into a reality. Potentiality of freedom is a native gift or part of\n",
      "our constitution in that we have capacity for growth and for\n",
      "being actively concerned in the process and the direction it takes.\n",
      "Actual or positive freedom is not a native gift or endowment but\n",
      "is acquired. In the degree in which we become aware of\n",
      "possibilities of development and actively concerned to keep the avenues\n",
      "of growth open, in the degree in which we fight against\n",
      "induration and fixity, and thereby realize the possibilities of recreation\n",
      "of our selves, we are actually free.\n",
      "Except as the outcome of arrested development, there is no\n",
      "such thing as a fixed, ready-made, finished self. Every living self\n",
      "causes acts and is itself caused in return by what it does. All\n",
      "voluntary action is a remaking of self, since it creates new desires,\n",
      "instigates to new modes of endeavor, brings to light new\n",
      "conditions which institute new ends. Our personal identity is found in\n",
      "the thread of continuous development which binds together\n",
      "these changes. In the strictest sense, it is impossible for the self to\n",
      "stand still; it is becoming, and becoming for the better or the\n",
      "worse. It is in the quality of becoming that virtue resides. We set\n",
      "up this and that end to be reached, but the end is growth itself.\n",
      "To make an end a final goal is but to arrest growth. Many a\n",
      "person gets morally discouraged because he has not attained the\n",
      "object upon which he set his resolution, but in fact his moral status\n",
      "is determined by his movement in that direction, not by his\n",
      "possession. If such a person would set his thought and desire upon\n",
      "the process of evolution instead of upon some ulterior goal, he\n",
      "would find a new freedom and happiness. It is the next step\n",
      "which lies within our power.\n",
      "It follows that at each point there is a distinction between an\n",
      "old, an accomplished self, and a new and moving self, between\n",
      "the static and the dynamic self. The former aspect is constituted\n",
      "by habits already formed. Habit gives facility, and there is always\n",
      "a tendency to rest on our oars, to fall back on what we have\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "already achieved. For that is the easy course; we are at home and\n",
      "feel comfortable in lines of action that run in the tracks of habits\n",
      "already established and mastered. Hence, the old, the habitual\n",
      "self, is likely to be treated as if it were the self; as if new\n",
      "conditions and new demands were something foreign and hostile. We\n",
      "become uneasy at the idea of initiating new courses; we are\n",
      "repelled by the difficulties that attend entering upon them; we\n",
      "dodge assuming a new responsibility. We tend to favor the old\n",
      "self and to make its perpetuation the standard of our valuations\n",
      "and the end of our conduct. In this way, we withdraw from\n",
      "actual conditions and their requirements and opportunities; we\n",
      "contract and harden the self.\n",
      "The growing, enlarging, liberated self, on the other hand, goes\n",
      "forth to meet new demands and occasions, and readapts and\n",
      "remakes itself in the process. It welcomes untried situations. The\n",
      "necessity for choice between the interests of the old and of\n",
      "the forming, moving, self is recurrent. It is found at every stage of\n",
      "civilization and every period of life. The civilized man meets it as\n",
      "well as the savage; the dweller in the slums as well as the person\n",
      "in cultivated surroundings; the \"good\" person as well as the\n",
      "\"bad.\" For everywhere there is an opportunity and a need to go\n",
      "beyond what one has been, beyond \"himself,\" if the self is\n",
      "identified with the body of desires, affections, and habits which has\n",
      "been potent in the past. Indeed, we may say that the good person\n",
      "is precisely the one who is most conscious of the alternative, and\n",
      "is the most concerned to find openings for the newly forming or\n",
      "growing self; since no matter how \"good\" he has been, he\n",
      "becomes \"bad\" (even though acting upon a relatively high plane of\n",
      "attainment) as soon as he fails to respond to the demand for\n",
      "growth. Any other basis for judging the moral status of the self is\n",
      "conventional. In reality, direction of movement, not the plane of\n",
      "attainment and rest, determines moral quality.\n",
      "Practically all moralists have made much of a distinction\n",
      "between a lower and a higher self, speaking of the carnal and\n",
      "spiritual, the animal and the truly human, the sensuous and the\n",
      "rational, selves which exist side by side in man and which war with\n",
      "one another. Moralists have often supposed that the line between\n",
      "the two selves could be drawn once for all and upon the basis of\n",
      "definite qualities and traits belonging respectively to one and the\n",
      "other. The only distinction, however, that can be drawn without\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "reducing morals to conventionality, self-righteous complacency,\n",
      "or a hopeless and harsh struggle for the unattainable, is that\n",
      "between the attained static, and the moving, dynamic self. When\n",
      "there is talk of the lower animal self, and so on, it is always by\n",
      "contrast, not on the basis of fixed material. A self that was truly\n",
      "moral under a set of former conditions may become a sensuous,\n",
      "appetitive self when it is confronted with a painful need for\n",
      "developing new attitudes and devoting itself to new and difficult\n",
      "objectives. And, contrariwise, the higher self is that formed by\n",
      "the step in advance of one who has been living on a low plane.\n",
      "As he takes the step he enters into an experience of freedom. If\n",
      "we state the moral law as the injunction to each self on every\n",
      "possible occasion to identify the self with a new growth that is\n",
      "possible, then obedience to law is one with moral freedom.\n",
      "In concluding the theoretical discussion of Part Two, we sum\n",
      "up by stating the point of view from which all the different\n",
      "problems and ideas have been looked at. For this point of view it is,\n",
      "which supplies the unifying thread: Moral conceptions and\n",
      "processes grow naturally out of the very conditions of human life.\n",
      "(1) Desire belongs to the intrinsic nature of man; we cannot\n",
      "conceive a human being who does not have wants, needs, nor one\n",
      "to whom fulfillment of desire does not afford satisfaction. As\n",
      "soon as the power of thought develops, needs cease to be blind;\n",
      "thought looks ahead and foresees results. It forms purposes,\n",
      "plans, aims, ends-in-view. Out of these universal and inevitable\n",
      "facts of human nature there necessarily grow the moral\n",
      "conceptions of the Good, and of the value of the intellectual phase of\n",
      "character, which amid all the conflict of desires and aims strives\n",
      "for insight into the inclusive and enduring satisfaction: wisdom,\n",
      "prudence.\n",
      "(2) Men live together naturally and inevitably in society; in\n",
      "companionship and competition; in relations of cooperation and\n",
      "subordination. These relations are expressed in demands, claims,\n",
      "expectations. One person has the conviction that fulfillment of\n",
      "his demands by others is his right; to these others it comes as an\n",
      "obligation, something owed, due, to those who assert the claim.\n",
      "Out of the interplay of these claims and obligations there arises\n",
      "the general concept of Law, Duty, Moral Authority, or Right.\n",
      "(3) Human beings approve and disapprove, sympathize and\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "resent, as naturally and inevitably as they seek for the objects\n",
      "they want, and as they impose claims and respond to them. Thus\n",
      "the moral Good presents itself neither merely as that which\n",
      "satisfies desire, nor as that which fulfills obligation, but as that which\n",
      "is approvable. From out of the mass of phenomena of this sort\n",
      "there emerge the generalized ideas of Virtue or Moral Excellence\n",
      "and of a Standard which regulates the manifestation of approval\n",
      "and disapproval, praise and blame.\n",
      "Special phenomena of morals change from time to time with\n",
      "change of social conditions and the level of culture. The facts of\n",
      "desiring, purpose, social demand and law, sympathetic approval\n",
      "and hostile disapproval are constant. We cannot imagine them\n",
      "disappearing as long as human nature remains human nature,\n",
      "and lives in association with others. The fundamental\n",
      "conceptions of morals are, therefore, neither arbitrary nor artificial.\n",
      "They are not imposed upon human nature from without but\n",
      "develop out of its own operations and needs. Particular aspects of\n",
      "morals are transient; they are often, in their actual\n",

      "§ 1. The Moral Significance of Social Questions\n",
      "Part II undertook an analysis of the most important\n",
      "concepts of morals. The analysis was carried on in the interest of\n",
      "reflective morality. Now reflection goes on within the minds of\n",
      "individuals. Consequently the emphasis fell upon the attitudes\n",
      "and responses of individual persons. We repeatedly noted,\n",
      "however, that the social environment has great influence in calling\n",
      "out and repressing the thought of individuals, and in sharpening\n",
      "or dulling their moral sensitiveness. From the social human\n",
      "environments proceed ultimately the problems which reflection has\n",
      "to deal with (pp. 212, 233).\n",
      "In Part III we propose to consider these problems from the\n",
      "social side, especially those problems which demand solution in\n",
      "the existing conditions of social life. The analysis of the previous\n",
      "Part may be called formal, since it deals with basic conceptions\n",
      "of morals, such as Good, Right, Duty, Approbation, Standard,\n",
      "Virtue, etc. Now we shall consider the content or material of\n",
      "these ideas which is provided by contemporary organization of\n",
      "life.\n",
      "When social life is stable, when custom rules, the problems of\n",
      "morals have to do with the adjustments which individuals make\n",
      "to the institutions in which they live, rather than with the moral\n",
      "quality of the institutions themselves. Men take their social\n",
      "relations for granted; they are what they are and, in being that, are\n",
      "what they should be. If anything is wrong it is due to the failure\n",
      "of individuals to do what social customs tell them to do. Only\n",
      "a few daring persons criticize ancestral habits, and then only\n",
      "guardedly. When social life is in a state of flux, moral issues cease\n",
      "to gather exclusively about personal conformity and deviation.\n",

      "Some of these problems of \"social order and social test\" will\n",
      "now engage our attention. We noticed, in an earlier discussion,\n",
      "that the problem of egoism and altruism arose in a time when\n",
      "morality was thought of chiefly in personal terms. At that time,\n",
      "social relations were thought of in terms of relations to other\n",
      "individuals as individuals, and then egoism and altruism exhaust\n",
      "the alternatives (p. 298). Utilitarianism with its social criterion\n",
      "tended, however, to bring to the fore issues which question the\n",
      "moral worth of existing social arrangements themselves. The\n",
      "opposed theory of Kant was also actuated by ideals which ran\n",
      "counter to the then existing organization of political society. In\n",
      "fact, ever since the latter half of the eighteenth century the\n",
      "interesting and stirring human problems for intellectual inquiry as\n",

      "of considering the moral bearing of social problems is that we\n",
      "are then confronted with live issues in which vital choices still\n",
      "have to be made, and with situations where principles are still in\n",
      "process of forming. We are thus saved from the \"moralistic\"\n",
      "narrowing down of morals to which reference has been made from\n",
      "time to time; we appreciate that morals are as wide as the area of\n",
      "everything which affects the values of human living. These values\n",
      "are involved on the widest scale in social issues. Hence critical\n",
      "questioning of existing institutions and critical discussion of\n",
      "changes, proposed on the theory that they will produce social\n",
      "betterment, are the best means of enforcing the fact that moral\n",
      "theory is more than a remote exercise in conceptual analysis or\n",
      "than a mere mode of preaching and exhortation. When we take\n",
      "the social point of view we are compelled to realize the extent to\n",

      "and also the extent to which thinking, new ideas, can change this\n",
      "environment.\n",
      "Study from this point of view also enforces, as nothing else\n",
      "can, a conclusion reached in our theoretical analysis. It discloses\n",
      "in a concrete fashion the limitation of moral theory and the\n",
      "positive office which it can perform. It shows that it is not the\n",
      "business of moral theory to provide a ready-made solution to\n",
      "large moral perplexities. But it also makes it clear that while the\n",
      "solution has to be reached by action based on personal choice,\n",
      "theory can enlighten and guide choice and action by revealing\n",
      "alternatives, and by bringing to light what is entailed when we\n",
      "choose one alternative rather than another. It shows, in short,\n",
      "that the function of theory is not to furnish a substitute for\n",
      "personal reflective choice but to be an instrument for rendering\n",
      "deliberation more effective and hence choice more intelligent (p. 165).\n",
      "Again, conventionalized morals conceal from view the\n",
      "uncertainty which attends decision as to what is good in a concrete\n",
      "case, and covers up the problematic nature of what is right and\n",
      "obligatory. But consideration of social questions and conflicting\n",
      "proposals brings just these things home to us. It puts before us\n",

      "increasing number, who see that such questions as these cannot be\n",
      "settled by deduction from fixed premises, and that the attempt to\n",
      "decide them in that fashion is the road to the intolerant\n",
      "fanaticism, dogmatism, class strife, of the closed mind. Wars waged in\n",
      "the alleged interest of religion, or in defense of particular\n",

      "of such intelligence and in promoting it by clarifying issues,\n",
      "proposing solutions, guiding the action which tests the worth of\n",
      "these proposals.\n",
      "The foregoing remarks should make clear what is meant by\n",
      "that change from personal to social morality which has been\n",
      "referred to. It does not signify that morality becomes impersonal\n",
      "and collective; it remains and must remain personal in that social\n",
      "problems have to be faced by individuals, and decisions reached\n",
      "in the forum of individual minds have to be carried into effect by\n",
      "individual agents, who are in turn personally responsible for the\n",
      "consequences of their acts. Morals are personal because they\n",
      "spring from personal insight, judgment, and choice. Such facts as\n",
      "these, however, are wholly consistent with the fact that what\n",
      "men think and believe is affected by common factors, and that\n",
      "the thought and choice of one individual spreads to others. They\n",
      "do not militate against the fact that men have to act together,\n",
      "and that their conjoint action is embodied in institutions and\n",
      "laws; that unified action creates government and legislative\n",
      "policies, forms the family, establishes schools and churches,\n",
      "manifests itself in business corporations of vast extent and power, in\n",
      "clubs and fraternities for enjoyment and recreation, and in\n",

      "\"surrounds\" is too external a term, since every individual lives in\n",
      "the network as a part of it. The material of personal reflection\n",
      "and of choice comes to each of us from the customs, traditions,\n",
      "institutions, policies, and plans of these large collective wholes.\n",
      "They are the influences which form his character, evoke and\n",
      "confirm his attitudes, and affect at every turn the quality of his\n",
      "happiness and his aspirations. This statement is true not only of the\n",
      "associations of which he is a direct member but also of those\n",
      "which seem external to him; since through commerce, war, and\n",
      "intercommunication the action of one territorial nation affects\n",
      "the members of another, while the standards set by one social\n",
      "group, say that of wealth and prestige, affect the desires and the\n",
      "capabilities of individuals in other groups.\n",
      "At the present time, almost all important ethical problems\n",
      "arise out of the conditions of associated life. As we have\n",
      "previously noted, in a stationary society, in one dominated by custom,\n",
      "the existing social order seems to be like the order of nature\n",
      "itself; as inevitable, and as necessary or as capricious as the case\n",
      "may be. Any suggestion for change is regarded as \"unnatural.\"\n",
      "Even in present social life, any deep-seated change is opposed as\n",
      "contrary to nature; such was the case, for example, in the case of\n",
      "\"votes for women\" a short time ago. Such is the case still with\n",
      "proposals for, say, doing away with war, or the elimination of the\n",
      "pecuniary profit motive from industry. Nevertheless, when\n",
      "inventions modify social conditions, when new wants and new\n",
      "satisfactions abound, when dislocations of elements of population\n",
      "through migration take place on a large scale, when cultures\n",
      "once separated mix and influence one another, when new modes\n",
      "of industry invade domestic life, when the emergence of\n",
      "increased leisure time coincides with new opportunities for\n",
      "amusement, when great combinations of capital arise which determine\n",
      "the opportunities of individuals for finding work, attention is\n",
      "forced to note the influence exerted upon individuals by\n",
      "collective conditions. Personal selves are forced, unless they are merely\n",
      "to drift, to consider their own action with respect to social\n",
      "changes. They are forced, if they engage in reflection at all, to\n",
      "determine what social tendencies they shall favor and which\n",
      "ones they shall oppose; which institutions they will strive to\n",
      "conserve and which they will endeavor to modify or abolish. That\n",
      "the present is a time of social changes such as have been\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "mentioned is a commonplace; the mere existence alone of democratic\n",
      "government, for example, raises social issues for moral decision\n",
      "which did not exist for most men and women so long as\n",
      "government was autocratic and confined to a few.\n",
      "The change from \"personal\" to \"social\" morality concerns\n",
      "then the kind of moral questions which are uppermost. For\n",
      "many individuals it is not now a question of whether they\n",
      "individually will appropriate property belonging to another, but\n",
      "whether existing large-scale economic arrangements operate to\n",
      "effect an equitable distribution of property; and if not, what they\n",
      "as individuals shall do about it. In one sense the change to social\n",
      "morality makes morals more acutely personal than they were\n",
      "when custom ruled. It forces the need of more personal\n",
      "reflection, more personal knowledge and insight, more deliberate and\n",
      "steadfast personal convictions, more resolute personal attitudes\n",
      "in action—more personal in the sense of being more conscious\n",
      "in choice and more voluntary in execution. It would then be\n",
      "absurd to suppose that \"social morals\" meant a swallowing up of\n",
      "individuality in an anonymous mass, or an abdication of\n",
      "personal responsibility in decision and action. It signifies that the\n",
      "social conditions and social consequences of personal action\n",
      "(which always exist in any case), are now brought to explicit\n",
      "consciousness so that they require searching thought and careful\n",
      "judgment in a way practically unprecedented formerly. It\n",
      "indicates that reflection is morally indispensable. It points out the\n",
      "material of reflection: the sort of things to which moral inquiry\n",
      "and judgment must go out.\n",
      "There are countless illustrations of the way in which a\n",
      "problem of personal conduct is so complicated by social conditions\n",
      "that a person has to decide about the latter in order to reach a\n",
      "conclusion in the former. His problem thus takes the form: What\n",
      "attitude shall I adopt towards an issue which concerns many\n",
      "persons whom I do not know personally, but whose action along\n",
      "with mine will determine the conditions under which we all live?\n",
      "A person may have reached a conclusion satisfactory to himself\n",
      "about his own use or non-use of alcoholic liquors, but he finds\n",
      "that this matter runs out into the question of legislative and\n",
      "constitutional action by the nation as a whole. He may find the\n",
      "comparatively simple problem of his relations to members of his own\n",
      "family running out into problems of marriage and divorce which\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "require collective and conjoint action. An individual who takes\n",
      "regard for human life as an unquestioned matter of course\n",
      "suddenly finds that the matter assumes an entirely new face when his\n",
      "nation is at war. A person engaged in making a livelihood for\n",
      "himself and his family finds himself out of work for causes over\n",
      "which he has no personal control, and he may be then called\n",
      "upon to reach a judgment regarding large matters of economic\n",
      "and political policy which can be settled only by collective\n",
      "action. These are but samples of the broadening out of issues of\n",
      "personal conduct till they include the formation of intelligent\n",
      "judgments upon great social institutions, family, property,\n",
      "political states. Unless men are to surrender to chance, to caprice, to\n",
      "prejudice, they must have some general moral principles by\n",
      "which to guide themselves in meeting such questions.\n",
      "§ 2. The Underlying Issue: Individual and Social\n",
      "While the problems themselves are concrete and\n",
      "particular, experience shows that, in dealing with them, most persons,\n",
      "from temperament, education, or environment, lean in one\n",
      "direction or another. Some incline to favor private as against\n",
      "combined action. They think that the presumption is always in favor\n",
      "of leaving individuals to themselves, and that collectively\n",
      "organized action is to be looked upon with suspicion, since to them it\n",
      "involves invasion of the realm of personal liberty; every such\n",
      "intervention is, according to them, an interference which has to be\n",
      "especially justified. There are others who incline to reverse the\n",
      "presumption; they place the burden of evidence against the\n",
      "isolated individual. They think of him as egoistic in the main,\n",
      "seeking his own private gain, lacking in consideration of the rights of\n",
      "others, and needing to be guided by the laws of a group if he is\n",
      "not to become a social menace. Or, they think of an individual as\n",
      "in and of himself an ignorant barbarian, living on a level\n",
      "deprived of art and science, and requiring the beneficent activity of\n",
      "society to develop him into any worthy culture of mind and\n",

      "strengthening of these collective social forces is, therefore, the\n",
      "primary duty of all those who are interested in the moralization\n",

      "a practical one. It is claimed that only organized social action\n",

      "Indeed, so common is it that the whole struggle for political\n",
      "liberty has been represented as a struggle of subjects to\n",
      "emancipate themselves from the tyranny of rulers.\n",
      "There are then a multitude of conflicts not between individuals\n",

      "explain why there arose the idea that the conflict is between\n",
      "individual and society.\n",
      "1. There is the struggle between the dominant group and the\n",
      "group or groups, occupying, at the time, an inferior position of\n",
      "power and economic wealth. The superior group under such\n",
      "circumstances always thinks of itself as representing the social\n",
      "interest, and represents other groups which challenge its power as\n",
      "rebels against constituted authority, as seeking for the\n",
      "satisfaction of their personal appetites against the demands of law and\n",
      "order. A somewhat striking example of this phase of the matter\n",
      "is seen at the present time in the split between those who hold up\n",
      "the political state as the supreme social form, the culminating\n",
      "manifestation of the supreme common moral will, the ultimate\n",
      "source and sole guarantor of all social values, and those who\n",
      "regard the state as simply one of many forms of association, and as\n",
      "one which by undue extension of its claims into virtual\n",
      "monopoly has brought evils in its train. The conflict is not, as was\n",
      "believed earlier, between the state and individual but between the\n",
      "state as the dominant group and other groups seeking greater\n",
      "liberty of action. It is similar in principle, though often opposite in\n",
      "point of material constituents, to the earlier struggle of political\n",
      "groups to get free from the dominant authority of the church.\n",
      "2. At a certain stage of such conflicts, the inferior but growing\n",
      "group is not organized; it is loosely knit; its members often do\n",
      "not speak for a group which has achieved recognition, much less\n",
      "for social organization as a whole. The dominant group on the\n",

      "other hand is not only well established, but it is accepted,\n",
      "acknowledged; it is supported by the bulk of opinion and\n",
      "sentiment of that time. A government which at a later period is\n",
      "regarded as thoroughly despotic cannot always have been so\n",
      "regarded. In that case it would have been easily overthrown.\n",
      "To remain in power a dominant class must at least seem to the\n",
      "mass to represent and to sustain interests which they themselves\n",
      "prize. There is thus added to the conflict of the old and\n",
      "established class with the inferior but developing group, the conflict\n",
      "of values that are generally accepted with those which are\n",
      "coming into being. This for a time takes the form of a struggle\n",
      "between a majority conserving the old, and a minority interested in\n",
      "the generation of something new, in progress. Since it takes time\n",
      "for an idea to gain recognition and for a value to become\n",
      "appreciated and shared, the new and relatively unorganized, although\n",
      "it may represent a genuinely important social value, is felt to be\n",
      "that of dissenting individuals. The values of a past society which\n",
      "are to be conserved are recognized as social, while those of a\n",
      "future society which has yet to be brought into being are taken to\n",
      "be those of individuals only.\n",
      "In these two instances, the conflict is commonly thought to be\n",
      "between those interested in order and those concerned in\n",
      "progress, where maintenance of order is interpreted as \"social\" and\n",
      "the initiation of progress as the function of individuals. Even\n",
      "those whose activity in the end establishes a new social order\n",
      "often feel at the time that the enemy is social organization itself.\n",
      "Moreover, every social order has many defects, and these defects\n",
      "are taken to be signs of evils inhering in every kind of social\n",
      "organization. The latter is felt to be nothing but a system of chains\n",
      "holding individuals in bondage. This feeling grows up\n",
      "particularly when old institutions are decaying and corrupt. As in\n",
      "France in the latter eighteenth century and Russia in the later\n",
      "nineteenth, they then call out an intense moral individualism like\n",
      "that of Rousseau and that of Tolstoi respectively. When\n",
      "organization needs to be changed all organization is likely to be felt\n",
      "oppressive. The temporary phenomenon is taken as an illustration\n",
      "of an eternal truth, and the needs of a particular situation frozen\n",
      "into a universal principle.\n",
      "3. There are also cases in which the troubles of the present are\n",
      "associated with the breakdown of a past order, while existing\n",

      "evils are capable of being remedied only by organized social\n",
      "action. Then the alignment of so-called individual and social is\n",

      "existing régime and who wish to have it retained are now the\n",
      "\"individualists,\" and those who wish to see great changes brought\n",
      "about by combined action are the \"collectivists.\" These latter\n",
      "feel that institutions as they exist are a repressive shell preventing\n",
      "social growth. They find disintegration, instability, inner\n",
      "competition to be so great that existing society is such only in outward\n",
      "appearance, being in reality what Carlyle called the \"society\" of\n",
      "his day, namely, \"anarchy plus the constable.\" On the other hand\n",
      "stand those who are at a special advantage in the situation. They\n",
      "extol it as the product of individual energy, initiative, industry,\n",
      "and freedom; these precious qualities will be imperiled by\n",
      "adoption of a plan of conjoint collective activity. They represent the\n",
      "social order desired by others to be one of servility which crushes\n",
      "out the incentives to individual effort, and which creates\n",
      "dependence upon an impersonal whole, putting a vicious paternalism\n",
      "in place of self-reliance. \"Collectivism\" in their mouths is a term\n",
      "of reproach. In short, those who are on the side of keeping the\n",
      "status quo intact are now the \"individualists,\" those who want\n",
      "great social changes are the \"collectivists,\" since the changes\n",
      "desired are on so large a scale that they can be effected only\n",
      "through collective action.\n",
      "We shall accordingly substitute the consideration of definite\n",
      "conflicts, at particular times and places, for a general opposition\n",
      "between social and individual. Neither \"social\" nor\n",

      "immediate inception and execution, in the desires, choices,\n",
      "dispositions from which conduct proceeds; social in its occasions,\n",

      "immoral at one time is hailed later on as the beginning of great\n",
      "and beneficent social reform—as is seen in the fate of those\n",
      "moral prophets who were condemned as criminals only to be\n",
      "honored later as benefactors of the race. Organizations that were\n",
      "punished as conspiracies by despotic governments have been\n",
      "regarded as the authors of a glorious liberty after their work has\n",

      "forms and modes of association and organization; thirdly,\n",
      "between accomplishing results by voluntary private effort, and by\n",
      "organized action involving the use of public agencies. In historic\n",
      "terms, there is the struggle between class and mass; between\n",
      "conservative and liberal (or radical); and between the use of private\n",
      "and public agencies, extension or limitation of public action.\n",
      "An illustration of the first issue is seen in the origin of states\n",
      "organized on a popular instead of upon an autocratic dynastic\n",
      "basis. This origin involved the overthrow of the established\n",
      "institutions which for a long time had regulated social affairs; it\n",
      "emancipated many individuals. But at the same time, it\n",
      "generated new types of social institutions and organizations. It was\n",
      "not in other words a movement toward mere individualism. The\n",

      "who want to preserve intact what has been already attained\n",

      "Examination of the special moral problems presented by\n",
      "existing social conditions is reserved for subsequent chapters.\n",
      "We shall here attempt to illustrate what has been said by a\n",
      "reference to the movement termed \"individualism\" in a particular\n",
      "sense determined by historical causes.\n",
      "1. In economics, it is the notion that individuals left free to\n",
      "pursue their own advantage in industry and trade will not only\n",
      "best further their own private interests but will also best promote\n",
      "social progress and contribute most effectively to the satisfaction\n",
      "of the needs of others and hence to the general happiness.\n",
      "2. Since the \"left free\" in this statement signifies in point of\n",
      "practice freedom from regulation by legislation and\n",
      "governmental administration, the doctrine has its political side. It signifies\n",
      "that the activities of government shall be restricted as closely as\n",
      "possible to policing society; that is, to keeping order, to\n",
      "preventing encroachments by one person upon the lawful rights of\n",
      "others, and to securing redress when such interference with the\n",
      "rights of others has occurred. In current phrases, it signifies\n",
      "\"keep government out of business\"; at least keep it out as much\n",
      "as possible.\n",
      "3. Since the doctrine has an \"ideological\" support, it also\n",
      "signifies a certain general philosophy, which may be called that of\n",
      "the \"natural\" versus \"artificial.\" Economic activities on this\n",
      "view are natural and governed by natural laws. Men naturally\n",
      "seek to satisfy their wants; labor or the expenditure of energy is\n",
      "naturally economized so that there will be the utmost return for\n",
      "the minimum outgo; to make the future secure men naturally\n",
      "abstain from consuming all they produce, thus laying by capital to\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "increase their future productivity. Since the output of work is\n",
      "greatest when there is the skill which comes with restriction of\n",
      "effort to one field, division of labor is inherent in the\n",
      "development and this division brings about exchange and trade. There\n",
      "results a general interdependence in which each is forced to find\n",
      "the line of work in which he is most productive and to do the\n",
      "things which, in order to bring the most return to himself, will\n",
      "best serve the needs of others. In contrast with the \"natural\n",
      "laws\" of this economic process, political laws are artificial; the\n",
      "first are implanted by nature (often conceived of as vice-regent of\n",
      "God) in the human frame. The second are man-made. The\n",
      "presumption is always in favor of natural laws and their workings\n",
      "and against human \"interference.\"\n",
      "4. To this idea of natural laws, identical with economic laws,\n",
      "was joined an idea of natural rights. According to this view,\n",
      "certain rightful claims belong inherently to individuals apart from\n",
      "civil society and the State. The right to life, to property which\n",
      "one has personally produced, to contract or make agreements\n",
      "with others, are such rights; they contrast with civil and political\n",
      "rights which are dependent upon the civil and political\n",
      "organization of society. Being innate and inalienable, they set fixed limits\n",
      "to the activity of government. Government exists in order to\n",
      "protect them; if it infringes on them, it violates its own function so\n",
      "that citizens are released from an obligation to obedience. At the\n",
      "least, courts must pronounce such action invalid because in\n",
      "violation of natural rights.\n",
      "5. There was often, although not always, associated with the\n",
      "above mentioned four points, the doctrine of self-interest, taken\n",
      "as a scientific support based on psychology. According to this\n",
      "view, human nature is so constituted as to be averse to all activity\n",
      "involving the sacrifice of abstinence and toil except when an\n",
      "incentive of the prospect of a greater advantage or profit is offered.\n",
      "All individuals are supposed to be on the alert for their own\n",
      "interest and to be skilled in calculating where it lies—provided at\n",
      "least that they are not paralyzed or confused by oppressive laws\n",
      "and artificial social institutions.\n",
      "These various considerations taken as a whole constitute the\n",
      "doctrine of \"individualism\" in its narrower historic sense. It was\n",
      "formulated during the eighteenth century. It had immense\n",
      "influence—far from extinct as yet—in shaping legal and political\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "institutions throughout the nineteenth century. There were definite\n",
      "causes for its appearance and its growth. Newly invented\n",
      "machines, run by steam power instead of by hand, were creating a\n",
      "new industrial development, while existing laws and customs\n",
      "expressed an agrarian culture and contained many feudal survivals.\n",
      "They were filled with regulations which obstructed commerce,\n",
      "foreign and domestic, which hampered the development of the\n",
      "new type of industry, and which favored landlords at the expense\n",
      "of the manufacturing and mercantile class. European\n",
      "governments regulated (in fact obstructed) international trade in the\n",
      "interest of accumulation of specie in the governmental treasury, at\n",
      "the expense of industry and commerce. The doctrine of\n",
      "economic laissez faire then presented itself as an unshackling of\n",
      "human initiative, energy, and inventive skill, as opening a definite\n",
      "road of progress. Established organization on the other hand\n",
      "represented inertia, sloth, and repression. This temporary\n",
      "historic conflict was generalized into an inherent and absolute\n",
      "opposition between the \"individual\" and the \"social,\" the\n",
      "\"natural\" and the \"artificial.\"\n",
      "The period coincided with the beginnings of what we now\n",
      "term popular and democratic government. Governments in\n",
      "general were either corrupt or oppressive or both. They were felt—\n",
      "and at the time with good reason—to mark arbitrary limitations\n",
      "on the legitimate freedom of individuals. In the United States,\n",
      "this feeling was reenforced by the struggle between the colonists\n",
      "and the home government in Great Britain. It was an easy step\n",
      "from the restrictions imposed on the colonies by Great Britain to\n",
      "the idea that all government by its very nature tends to be\n",
      "repressive, and that the great aim in political life is to limit the\n",
      "encroachments of governments in order to make secure the liberty\n",
      "of citizens. The United States was born in the atmosphere of\n",
      "jealousy and fear of State action; the tradition has persisted; it forms\n",
      "a large part of the present power of individualistic philosophy.\n",
      "This feeling, combined with the personal initiative,\n",
      "independence, and self-help that were so indispensable under pioneer\n",
      "conditions in a country of small population and having\n",
      "seemingly unbounded natural resources, operated to create a moral\n",
      "background for the doctrine of individualism. Although the idea\n",
      "of democracy was that of self-rule, the traditions and emotions\n",
      "generated under conditions of alien rule persisted to such an\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "extent that any conception that the people could use their own\n",
      "instrument, government, as a constructive agency for furthering\n",
      "their own well-being, was confined at most to the administration\n",
      "of local communities. The doctrine of the superiority of \"natural\n",
      "laws\" to man-made law led to an abdication of effort at\n",
      "intelligent control; economic processes were supposed to work of\n",
      "themselves and to a beneficent end. The idea of natural rights\n",
      "was interpreted by courts to forbid legislation which in any way\n",
      "disturbed the status quo in the distribution of property, or which,\n",
      "in the interest of workers, limited the power of free contract—\n",
      "the legal fiction being that all parties to an industrial\n",
      "arrangement were equally free to enter or not into the arrangement.\n",
      "Meantime the original circumstances, economic and political,\n",
      "under which the philosophy of so-called individualism grew up\n",
      "and had had, upon the whole, a useful effect, changed\n",
      "completely. Industrialism supplanted agrarianism as the ruling force.\n",
      "The machine became the regular instead of the novel and\n",
      "exceptional means of production. Impersonal corporations, instead of\n",
      "individual employers in personal contact with workmen, became\n",
      "the rule. Accumulations of capital grew large, and then merged\n",
      "into larger units. The doctrine of liberty and contract and of\n",
      "non-interference with the customary rules of industry inured to\n",
      "the benefit of the employer and investor, and to the detriment\n",
      "of the workers—that of the mass of people. Protective legislation\n",
      "began to make its way and was followed by the development of a\n",
      "\"collectivist\" point of view in opposition to the older\n",
      "\"individualism.\" The roles were reversed. The accepted, the established,\n",
      "social order came to include the things which earlier had had to\n",
      "be striven for by a minority. The social order was now itself\n",
      "\"individualistic\" in the sense defined above, and the doctrines and\n",
      "slogans which had been used earlier by dissidents and reformers\n",
      "were now used to defend the status quo. \"Liberty\" meant in\n",
      "effect the legally unrestrained action of those advantageously\n",
      "placed in the existing distribution of power, through possession\n",
      "of capital and ownership of the means of production.\n",
      "The ethical formula of the individualistic philosophy was and\n",
      "still remains: The greatest possible freedom of individuals as\n",
      "long as that freedom is not used to the detriment of equal or\n",
      "similar liberty on the part of other individuals. The formula has\n",
      "had great vogue; as already intimated, it once did a useful service\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "in getting rid of laws and institutions that had outlived their\n",
      "value. But there is, as an intellectual statement, a flaw in it, a\n",
      "\"catch.\" What is meant by like or equal freedom? If it signified\n",
      "materially alike, equal in actual power, it would be difficult to\n",
      "take objection to it. The formula would be compatible with the\n",
      "efforts of organized society to equalize conditions. It would, for\n",
      "example, justify public action to secure to all an education which\n",
      "would effect a complete development of their capacities, so that\n",
      "they might meet one another on a plane of knowledge and trained\n",
      "intelligence as nearly even as possible. It would justify legislation\n",
      "to equalize the standing of those now at a disadvantage because\n",
      "of inequality in physical power, in wealth, in command of the\n",
      "machinery of employment. It would justify, in other words, a\n",
      "vast amount of so-called social legislation which the\n",
      "individualistic theory as usually held condemns.\n",
      "But the interpretation given to the ideal of equality was\n",
      "formal, not material; it was legalistic not realistic. Individuals were\n",
      "said to be equal provided they were equal before the law. In legal\n",
      "theory, the individual who has a starving family to support is\n",
      "equal in making a bargain about hours and conditions of labor\n",
      "and wages, with an employer who has large accumulated wealth\n",
      "to fall back on, and who finds that many other workers near the\n",
      "subsistence line are clamoring for an opportunity to earn\n",
      "something with which to support their families.\n",
      "Morally speaking, individuals cannot be split up into a number\n",
      "of isolated and independent powers, all of which can be\n",
      "compared, one by one, with like powers of others so as to determine\n",
      "their equality. The individual person is a whole; what he labors\n",
      "at and the reward he gets are things which affect all his\n",
      "capacities, desires, and satisfactions—and not only his own but those\n",
      "of the members of his family. Just as we cannot tell what is \"due\"\n",
      "a man until we have taken his whole self into account, so we\n",
      "cannot tell whether a man's freedom is furthered or is interfered\n",
      "with until we have taken into account not just some single point,\n",
      "formally and legally defined, but the bearing of the factor in\n",
      "question (for example, \"freedom\" of contract) upon his whole\n",
      "plane of living, his opportunities for development, and his\n",
      "relations to others.\n",
      "The purpose of this historical survey is not to indicate that\n",
      "some anti-\"individualistic\" principle is correct, so that we should\n",

      "                            \n",
      "supplant it by a collectivistic formula and program in order to\n",
      "meet the moral requirements of society. It is, first, to suggest the\n",
      "relativism of social formulae in their ethical aspect. No single\n",
      "formula signifies the same thing, in its consequences, or in\n",
      "practical meaning under different social conditions. That which was\n",
      "on the side of moral progress in the eighteenth and early\n",
      "nineteenth centuries may be a morally reactionary doctrine in the\n",
      "twentieth century; that which is serviceable now may prove\n",
      "injurious at a later time. This fact is but a statement in more definite\n",
      "form of the impossibility of deriving concrete directions for\n",
      "moral action from the general concepts of individual and social.\n",
      "From this fact follows the second point. We have to consider\n",
      "the probable consequences of any proposed measure with\n",
      "reference to the situation, as it exists at some defined time and place\n",
      "in which it is to apply. There cannot be any universal rule laid\n",
      "down, for example, regarding the respective scopes of private\n",
      "and public action. All but the most extreme \"individualists\" stop\n",
      "short of the logical conclusion that there should be no public\n",
      "schools supported by taxation. They are aware of how many\n",
      "children might, under a purely voluntary system, fail to get any\n",
      "education, and they know what inequalities in society would\n",
      "thereby be fostered. Yet, it does not follow that public education\n",
      "is always and only good. A ruling class and the government may\n",
      "use the schools to inculcate particular doctrines in plastic minds;\n",
      "to suppress freedom of inquiry; to turn out minds in a common\n",
      "mold, and a mold favorable to their own special interest. Under\n",
      "such conditions, there is justification for upholding, on moral\n",
      "grounds, the claims of other schools than those supported by the\n",
      "state.\n",
      "Every question for the extension or restriction of public action\n",
      "should, then, be considered on its merits. There was a time when\n",
      "religion and religious worship were public functions. Almost all\n",
      "peoples are now convinced that it is better that they should be a\n",
      "private, a voluntary, affair. There was a time in English history\n",
      "when the courts of law were not indeed exactly private, but were\n",
      "attached to the domain of feudal lords; few there are today who\n",
      "would question the value of the transfer of the judicial function\n",
      "to the State. But even this transfer is not inconsistent with the\n",
      "growth, under the jurisdiction of government, of private\n",
      "arbitration as a method of settling commercial disputes. If we go\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "further back in history we find the administration of justice in\n",
      "savage tribes a matter of \"self-help.\" There may have been those\n",
      "who opposed its transfer to the public on the ground that it\n",
      "would weaken individual initiative and responsibility and create\n",
      "a servile dependence on state paternalism. In general, we can say\n",
      "that many interests have shifted from public to private and vice\n",
      "versa in connection with changes in science, industry, and public\n",
      "sentiment. Every proposed measure of public policy should,\n",
      "therefore, be considered on the ground of its own effects on the\n",
      "welfare of the members of a community, and not be disposed of\n",
      "on the basis of some abstract theory of either the individual or\n",
      "the social.\n",
      "Finally, while we have taken our examples for the most part\n",
      "from the controversy concerning public versus private action,\n",
      "the principle that conclusions should be reached by analysis of\n",
      "consequences in definite situations holds good of the whole\n",
      "range of problems that have been mentioned. Take, for example,\n",
      "the respective moral claims of conservatism and radicalism. It is\n",
      "impossible to imagine a situation in which there are no values\n",
      "worked out in the past which need to be conserved. But their\n",
      "conservation may demand a change in the means by which they\n",
      "are maintained, a change in laws and habits. It is evident that not\n",
      "all customs and ways of doing things can be changed\n",
      "simultaneously. The inertia of habit renders it impossible in the first place,\n",
      "and any attempt in that direction would simply throw everything\n",
      "into chaos. Some habits must remain intact in order to get a\n",
      "positive leverage by which to effect changes desired in other\n",
      "institutions. The problem is always one of discrimination and\n",
      "emphasis: What social arrangements at any given time and place\n",
      "should be kept relatively stable and what arrangements should\n",
      "be modified, in order that values may be rendered more secure,\n",
      "more equitably distributed, richer and more diversified? As long\n",
      "as the issue is conceived in a wholesale manner, conservatism\n",
      "will tend to be blind and reactionary, and radicalism will tend to\n",
      "be abrupt and violent. In a normal society, there would be no\n",
      "class of professional reformers. Some social institutions, some\n",
      "phase of every institution, would be continually re-forming, in\n",
      "the literal sense of remaking, in order to be better adapted to its\n",
      "contemporary conditions of social life.\n",
      "To some persons it may seem an academic matter whether\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "their attitude and the method they follow in judging the ethical\n",
      "values of social institutions, customs, and traditions, be\n",
      "experimental or dogmatic and closed; whether they proceed by study\n",
      "of consequences, of the working of condition, or by an attempt\n",
      "to dispose of all questions by reference to preformed absolute\n",
      "standards. There is, however, no opening for application of\n",
      "scientific method in social morals unless the former procedure\n",
      "is adopted. There is at least a presumption that the\n",
      "development of methods of objective and impartial inquiry in social\n",
      "affairs would be as significant there as it has proved in physical\n",
      "matters. The alternative to organic inquiry is reliance upon\n",
      "prejudice, partisanship, upon tradition accepted without\n",
      "questioning, upon the varying pressures of immediate circumstance.\n",
      "Adoption of an experimental course of judgment would work\n",
      "virtually a moral revolution in social judgments and practice. It\n",
      "would eliminate the chief causes of intolerance, persecution,\n",
      "fanaticism, and the use of differences of opinion to create class\n",
      "wars. It is for such reasons as these that it is claimed that, at the\n",

      "§ 1. Does the Social Environment Have Moral Import?\n",
      "Previous discussion has virtually taken for granted a\n",
      "principle which is not admitted by all moralists and which must\n",
      "be made explicit, especially since it is fundamental to the whole\n",
      "range of questions we are to consider. The hypothesis in question\n",
      "is that the social environment has intrinsic moral significance;\n",
      "that it enters intimately into the formation and the substance\n",
      "of the desires, motives, and choices which make up character.\n",
      "There are those who hold the contrary. They assert that the\n",
      "environment is morally indifferent and neutral. This view is a\n",
      "perfectly logical conclusion from the tenet that moral goodness is\n",
      "wholly a matter of motives and that motives (and will) have\n",
      "nothing to do with consequences; it follows logically from the\n",
      "divorce of \"inner\" and \"outer\" and the identification of morals\n",
      "with the \"inner.\" To one who adopts this view, such things as the\n",
      "legal system, the political régime, the dominant economic order\n",
      "with whatever distribution of wealth and income, opportunity\n",
      "for work, control of the machinery of production and\n",
      "distribution, happens to exist, may have much to do with material\n",
      "prosperity but nothing to do with morality. For an individual in\n",
      "any system can have a righteous will. Social conditions, upon\n",
      "this theory, affect such things as comfort and happiness, but not\n",
      "moral selfhood; they influence the external execution of the\n",
      "motive but not the motive itself.\n",
      "We shall not repeat the criticism already passed (p. 173) upon\n",
      "the dualism set up between the inner motive or will and the\n",
      "outer act and consequences, beyond a reminder that this view\n",
      "deliberately and avowedly narrows the scope and contents of the\n",
      "\"moral.\" The theory of such a separation eliminates all concrete\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "elements from character, reducing it to mere arbitrary power of\n",
      "choice, the same in all, a purely formal matter. The notion that\n",
      "there is such a power of choosing, having no ground or reason\n",
      "outside the arbitrary choice itself, isolates the moral agent from\n",
      "all social relations. \"Will\" on this view is what it is, and acts as it\n",
      "does act, wholly independently of all environing conditions—\n",
      "domestic, economic, penal, political, legal, educational, those of\n",
      "friendship, etc. Although this conclusion follows logically from\n",
      "the premise, few who hold the premise carry the idea to its final\n",
      "conclusion. If social institutions and arrangements are without\n",
      "moral significance then the individual has no moral\n",
      "responsibility with respect to them; one system of, say, punishment,\n",
      "government, distribution of wealth, is just as good morally as any other.\n",
      "No one has any moral ground for trying to bring one system into\n",
      "existence in preference to another: social reform has no moral\n",
      "signification.\n",
      "If we surrender preconceived theories as to the nature of \"will,\"\n",
      "if we extend the meaning of character to include the whole body\n",
      "of desires, purposes, convictions, manifested in deliberation and\n",
      "choice, then surrounding conditions which arouse desires; which\n",
      "direct wants toward one object rather than another for\n",
      "satisfaction; which confirm certain purposes and weaken others; which\n",
      "lead to prizing some objects and disparaging others, have\n",
      "intrinsic moral meaning. It is empirically evident that the social world\n",
      "into which each of us is born exercises a constant stimulative and\n",
      "inhibitory effect upon desire and intent. The environment also\n",
      "acts in a non-moral fashion, like a physical force, in as far as we\n",
      "are unaware of its working. But its operation in shaping\n",
      "character comes into moral account as soon as we become aware of it\n",
      "and judge its quality, its direction, its value. Probably at the\n",
      "present time some social habits are so engrained that we, or at\n",
      "least most of us, are not even aware that they influence us. But as\n",
      "soon as they are perceived, they cease to operate in isolation or\n",
      "merely externally. As we become aware of them, we like or\n",
      "dislike their effects; we actively approve and support them; we\n",
      "tolerate them, we are willing to have them exist rather than take the\n",
      "trouble to change them; or we are moved to active opposition. In\n",
      "any case, there is human complicity, an assumption of\n",
      "responsibility. To many persons at present the economic system, in all\n",

      "it is no longer the bare institution which acts, but that institution\n",

      "the least that our will, the body of our desires and purposes, is\n",
      "subservient to social conditions, but that the latter are\n",
      "incorporated into our attitudes, and our attitudes into social conditions,\n",
      "to such an extent that to maintain one is to maintain the other, to\n",
      "change one is to change the other.\n",
      "It is possible to indicate some of the typical ways in which the\n",

      "determines opportunities. We never think of expecting the same\n",
      "desires and aims from the savage as from the civilized man. Ends\n",
      "open to one are non-existent for the other. An individual under\n",
      "any circumstances may have a desire to extend his knowledge, to\n",
      "enlarge his sensitiveness to whatever is lovely in his\n",
      "surroundings. The savage, barbarian, and cultivated man may have the\n",
      "same quality of responsiveness on their different levels, and so\n",
      "have the same kind of goodness of character (p. 281). But the\n",
      "actual material of character is different because opportunities for\n",
      "thought and choice vary so much. (b) Different types of\n",
      "institutions, customs, traditions stimulate and evoke different powers.\n",
      "The virtues of a militant society are not those of an\n",
      "industrialized community, nor are these the excellencies which would be\n",
      "especially prized in a society where science and art flourish. The\n",
      "pattern of social organization tends to be reflected in the pattern\n",
      "of character that obtains. (c) Since institutions relate persons to\n",
      "one another in definite ways, as for instance in some type of\n",
      "family organization, in such economic forms as contract and limited\n",
      "liability corporation, private property, business for pecuniary\n",

      "attributed to the better. There is no source save past experience out\n",
      "of which the concrete stuff of new aspirations can be formed.\n",
      "We are not concerned here to do more than to point out that\n",
      "the hypothesis adopted in the text is that social conditions enter\n",
      "integrally and intrinsically into the formation of character, that\n",
      "is, the make-up of desires, purposes, judgments of approval\n",
      "and disapproval. If this positive contention concerning the\n",
      "intimate connection of social conditions is admitted, the immediate\n",
      "problem of theory is the question of what criterion is to be used\n",
      "in judging social conditions as they exist at any time. The last\n",
      "chapter indicated the method by which the criterion should be\n",
      "reached and the spirit in which it should be employed, namely,\n",
      "the experimental. That statement concerns the form of the\n",
      "criterion rather than its content or substance. It indicates what has\n",
      "just been intimated, that it should be a generalization from the\n",
      "experiences of the past; a generalization which does not,\n",
      "however, merely repeat or restate in a literal fashion the experience of\n",
      "the past, but is stated in such a way that it will apply to changed\n",
      "conditions of the present and future; that it will serve as an\n",

      "rules, but as the indispensable source of suggestions to be worked\n",
      "over in thought. It has respect to intelligence, not as supplying\n",
      "final truths and rigid rules, but as the organ of putting past\n",

      "framed without reference to existing social conditions set up\n",
      "ends without means for their realization; since effective means\n",
      "must be found in what already exists. The habit of setting up\n",

      "which trusts to destruction of what exists to bring forth by some\n",

      "social morality acknowledges existing conditions to the full; it\n",
      "insists upon facing them intellectually, that is by way of\n",
      "observation and record; it also recognizes that criticisms and plans of\n",
      "betterment are mere indulgences unless they are based upon\n",
      "taking existing conditions into account. But as experimental, it\n",
      "recognizes that these conditions are not fixed and final; that they\n",
      "are both means of change and something to be changed by\n",
      "intelligently directed action. Our position is that past experience\n",

      "reinterpretation as experience progresses.\n",
      "§ 2. The Nature of the Criterion of Social Conditions\n",
      "In the earlier discussion we arrived at the conclusion\n",
      "that the effect of acts upon the common welfare, the general\n",
      "well-being, is the criterion for judging the moral worth of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "personal acts and dispositions (pp. 238-248). The presumption is\n",
      "that the same criterion holds with respect to social institutions\n",
      "and in projecting plans of social change. The idea of common\n",
      "good, general welfare, needs, however, careful interpretation. We\n",
      "may say of welfare what was said of the kindred idea of\n",
      "happiness, that we must beware of giving it a fixed meaning. Since it\n",
      "includes the harmonious fulfillment of all capacities, it grows as\n",
      "new potentialities are disclosed; it develops as social changes\n",
      "present new opportunities for personal development.\n",
      "Such terms as \"general\" and \"common\" need, perhaps, even\n",
      "more careful interpretation. The words come easily to the tongue\n",
      "and too readily give a wrong impression. They do not mean a\n",
      "sacrifice of individuality; it would be a poor kind of society\n",
      "whose members were personally undeveloped. It does not mean\n",
      "the submergence of what is distinctive, unique, in different\n",
      "human beings; such submergence would produce an\n",
      "impoverishment of the social whole. The positive import of \"common\n",
      "good\" is suggested by the idea of sharing, participating—an idea\n",
      "involved in the very idea of community. Sharing a good or value\n",
      "in a way which makes it social in quality is not identical with\n",
      "dividing up a material thing into physical parts. To partake is to\n",
      "take part, to play a role. It is something active, something which\n",
      "engages the desires and aims of each contributing member. Its\n",
      "proper analogue is not physical division but taking part in a\n",
      "game, in conversation, in a drama, in family life. It involves\n",
      "diversification, not sameness and repetition. There could be no\n",
      "communication of feeling and idea in a conversation if each one\n",
      "parrot-like said the same sentence over and over, and there could\n",
      "be no game played if all made the same motions at the same\n",
      "time. Each contributes something distinctive from his own store\n",
      "of knowledge, ability, taste, while receiving at the same time\n",
      "elements of value contributed by others. What is contributed to\n",
      "each is, first, a support, a reenforcement, of his own action;\n",
      "thereby each receives from others the factors which give his own\n",
      "position greater security—a fact illustrated by the mutual aid\n",
      "given to one another by the partners, the partakers on the same\n",
      "side of a game. In the second place what is contributed is\n",
      "enjoyment of new meanings, new values. In a debate each debater on\n",

      "What has been said helps to an understanding of the idea of\n",
      "equality as part of the social ideal. It does not mean sameness; it\n",
      "is not to be understood quantitatively, an interpretation which\n",
      "always ends in ideas of external and mechanical equality.\n",
      "Children gain enrichment of experience from parents precisely\n",

      "lives of parents are fuller and richer because of what they receive\n",
      "from their children as well as because of what they put forth.\n",
      "There is a great deal of discussion of equality which is meaningless\n",
      "and futile because the conception is taken in a static instead of in\n",
      "a functional way. One person is morally equal to others when he\n",
      "has the same opportunity for developing his capacities and\n",
      "playing his part that others have, although his capacities are quite\n",
      "unlike theirs. When there is an equation in his own life and\n",
      "experience between what he contributes to the group activity and\n",
      "experience and what he receives in return in the way of stimulus\n",
      "and of enrichment of experience, he is morally equal. The\n",
      "equality is one of values, not of materials and quantities, and equality\n",
      "of value has on this account to be measured in terms of the\n",
      "intrinsic life and growth of each individual, not by mechanical\n",
      "comparisons. Each individual is incommensurable as an\n",

      "is morally equal when his values with respect to his own\n",

      "democracy if it is to be adapted to present conditions. The second\n",
      "point has to do with the extent to which our political problems\n",
      "have become predominantly economic in nature. The two points\n",
      "are, as the discussion will disclose, intimately bound up together.\n",
      "The democratic theory took articulate shape in a pre-industrial\n",
      "and a prescientific age. And it bears the marks of the time of its\n",
      "origin. Although both the democratic theory and practice are\n",
      "recent, although they have endured but a short portion of the\n",
      "recorded time of history, there has been more human history,\n",
      "measured in terms of change and its rapidity, since they came\n",
      "into existence than in all previous ages. The validity of the ideal\n",
      "and criterion is questionable if the theory cannot be readapted\n",
      "and restated in terms of present-day life. (a) Intellectually,\n",
      "conditions during the late eighteenth century tended to give all social\n",
      "theory a fixed and absolutistic form. The consequence was that\n",
      "adherents and opponents of democracy alike often assume the\n",
      "identity of the theory with particular governmental methods and\n",
      "instruments that came into being at an early date. In the United\n",
      "States, the tendency to rigidity of interpretation and\n",
      "corresponding fixity of governmental institutions was favored by a written\n",
      "constitution and its provisions. (b) Moreover, as has already\n",
      "been noted, the theory of government was formulated during a\n",
      "period of struggle against governments which then existed, a\n",
      "revolt which was especially strong in the American colonies when\n",
      "the system took shape. The fear of government resulted in\n",
      "keeping the organs of government rudimentary; developments have\n",
      "for the most part taken place either covertly or only under the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "stress of a great crisis. The clumsiness of governmental\n",
      "procedure in contrast with the constant invention and use of new\n",
      "mechanisms and methods in industrial production has led upon\n",
      "the whole to distrust of governmental action rather than to an\n",
      "attempt to create new political organs.\n",
      "(c) The scheme of government was conceived in individualistic\n",
      "terms. The best immediate service that could be rendered society\n",
      "in the pioneer days of the republic was to give individuals a free\n",
      "chance to employ their personal abilities and energies in coping\n",
      "with the abundant resources of an undeveloped country. The\n",
      "\"sovereignty of the individual\" was supposed to be amply\n",
      "secured in politics by the grant of the suffrage in which every\n",
      "individual could exercise his independent judgment. The theory\n",
      "worked well enough as long as the country was agrarian and the\n",
      "population mainly rural. Problems were then comparatively\n",
      "simple, within the range of the personal experience of citizens,\n",
      "while the persons voted for were generally known personally or\n",
      "by repute. It is not necessary to point out how completely\n",
      "conditions have altered.\n",
      "(d) The conception of majority rule, determined by counting of\n",
      "individual ballots has, to take only one example, tended to work\n",
      "out in the opposite direction to that which was anticipated. It\n",
      "rested upon a kind of quantitative individualism, but it often\n",
      "operates to set up a new kind of despotism, in that ideas\n",
      "uncongenial to the majority are discouraged and their expression not\n",
      "only frowned upon but often prevented by violence. The\n",
      "individualistic conception, summed up into the rule of a majority, has\n",
      "put a false value upon mere uniformity, and created to some\n",
      "extent jealousy of distinction, fear of the dissenter and non-\n",
      "conformist in social matters, a fear increased as population has\n",
      "become heterogeneous through immigration. The result is\n",
      "obviously adverse to progress except in technical and material lines,\n",
      "since cultural progress must always start from a minority. Many\n",
      "instances can be found where dependence upon the false\n",
      "individualistic theory has operated to repress and hamper individuality\n",
      "of thought and expression.\n",
      "(e) As long as social life was relatively simple, it could be\n",
      "served by correspondingly simple machinery. As new conditions\n",
      "emerged, they were met, if at all, by a process of mechanical\n",
      "addition, not by one of internal readaptation. The consequence was\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the production of a clogged and cumbrous political machinery,\n",
      "creaking and often breaking down from its own weight.\n",
      "Moreover, as long as economic conditions were simple, as long as\n",
      "comparative, though of course not absolute, equality of\n",
      "industrial opportunity existed, there was no great motive for special\n",
      "interests to get hold of governmental agencies in order to use\n",
      "them for their own ends. Yet, even in the days of the adoption of\n",
      "the Constitution there was enough of a propertied class over\n",
      "against an unpropertied one to add fear of the populace to\n",
      "general fear of government, and to force a compromise with the\n",
      "freer democratic ideals of the Declaration of Independence,\n",
      "concessions to the manufacturing class of the North being balanced\n",
      "with concessions to the slave-owners of the South. The further\n",
      "development of this point takes us over into the second main\n",
      "point. But the conclusion to be drawn from the combined force\n",
      "of the items just mentioned is clear. The translation of the\n",
      "democratic ideal into governmental terms cannot safely be left to\n",
      "statements made on the basis of eighteenth century conditions.\n",
      "Political organs must be modified to meet new conditions. Until they\n",
      "are so modified, there is no way of telling how much of the current\n",
      "criticism and protest against democracy has to do with inherent\n",
      "values and how much with external defects of application.\n",
      "The second point concerns the modification in political theory\n",

      "their own ends. The studies which have been made of the factors\n",
      "which influence school administration and instruction in large\n",

      "inventing animal. It has been suggested that his very defects in\n",
      "natural means of offense and defense have stimulated him to\n",
      "invent the bow and arrow and other weapons, and that the lack of\n",
      "certain capacities for assimilating raw foods has stimulated\n",
      "inventions for increasing and preparing his food-supply. Unable\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "like the birds to migrate, he builds more elaborate shelters and\n",
      "discovers fire. The fundamental crafts of building, weaving,\n",
      "metal-working, agriculture, have not only supplied needs but\n",
      "have given scope for the early artist. Skill of hand and\n",
      "development of brain have gone side by side. The sequence of sowing\n",
      "and harvest, of work and achievement, of skill and success, has\n",
      "helped to shape character as well as to provide the means of\n",
      "living. The social influences of work are no less striking. It makes a\n",
      "difference whether a workman works for himself as an\n",
      "independent farmer and craftsman, or whether he works for another in a\n",
      "factory or a shop. It makes a difference whether he is forced to\n",
      "spend his strength upon hard and heavy tasks, or whether by\n",
      "using ox, horse, or machine to do the heavier tasks, he can\n",
      "substitute work of guiding or controlling. It makes a difference\n",
      "whether his work is relatively regular and his reward dependent\n",
      "upon his own exertions, or whether it is uncertain and\n",
      "dependent largely upon market conditions over which the individual\n",
      "worker has no control. And finally it makes a difference whether\n",
      "his relations with his fellow workers or employers are of a family\n",
      "or neighborly or friendly character, or whether the relation is\n",
      "purely impersonal and the motive for work is the acquisition of\n",
      "money in some form as wage or salary or profits.\n",
      "2. The single word which includes in large measure the\n",
      "outstanding features of the present methods of production and\n",
      "economic organization is capitalism. This may be contrasted with\n",
      "the system of primitive society in which each group for the most\n",
      "part supplied its own needs; or with that of feudalism, in which\n",
      "agriculture was the main industry, and the land was worked and\n",
      "household tasks performed by tenants who were not paid in\n",
      "money for their services but were required to give part of their\n",
      "time to the services of the lord as a condition of occupying a\n",
      "portion of the land, and utilizing this for their own support. As\n",
      "crafts and trade increased in importance the merchant and the\n",
      "banker accumulated wealth and could venture upon enterprises\n",
      "which required considerable sums of money, but the craftsmen\n",
      "continued for the most part to own their own tools and therefore\n",
      "to retain a certain measure of independence. They associated in\n",
      "gilds for mutual aid.\n",
      "It was the great inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth\n",
      "centuries which replaced the independent crafts of textile\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "workers, smiths, and a multitude of other trades, by factories with\n",
      "machines driven by water or steam power. These displaced hand\n",
      "work, and compelled the advance of large sums of money for\n",
      "building factories, equipping them with machines, supplying\n",
      "them with raw materials, marketing goods, and paying wages of\n",
      "workmen. The system in which the capitalist—that is, the man\n",
      "who can provide the necessary sums for factories, railroads,\n",
      "ships, and all other instruments of modern industry and\n",
      "commerce—is so important, is then very properly called capitalism.\n",
      "It may be contrasted, not only with the simpler systems of earlier\n",
      "times, but with a system such as that of socialism in which\n",
      "production is carried on more or less completely by society as\n",
      "organized in the State or otherwise. Russia is an example of a society\n",
      "which is very largely carrying on its manufactures through\n",
      "public ownership and direction as contrasted with private ownership\n",
      "and management.\n",
      "Two corner stones of capitalism are private property and\n",
      "freedom of enterprise. It is assumed that, barring violence and\n",
      "certain kinds of fraud, a man is free to enter upon any kind of\n",
      "enterprise which he chooses, and to hold as his own whatever he may\n",
      "acquire. Both these \"rights\" are indeed subject to certain\n",
      "limitations. He may not engage in an enterprise which perils his\n",
      "neighbors, such as the manufacture of explosives, without due\n",
      "precaution, or require his employees to operate dangerous machinery in\n",
      "unsanitary mines or factories, or engage in the sale of certain\n",
      "drugs, and in some countries, of alcoholic liquors, without\n",
      "government supervision, and as regards property he must pay taxes.\n",
      "Limitations of private enterprise and of property rights will be\n",
      "considered under a later head, but the general theory of\n",
      "capitalism is stated above.\n",
      "3. To insure that the system of private ownership with freedom\n",
      "of enterprise works for the general good, the reliance has been\n",
      "chiefly upon competition. This has been regarded as a sort of\n",
      "balance wheel which keeps wages, profits, and prices in a fair\n",
      "adjustment. It is supposed to secure just treatment of workmen, of\n",
      "owners, and of consumers. It is also supposed to stimulate the\n",
      "inventor and the manufacturer or trader to take the risks\n",
      "necessary for progress. If wages tend to be too low, competition\n",
      "between employers, it is held, will raise them. If profits under a\n",
      "monopoly or in any business are too great, other firms will be\n",
      "tempted to enter and thus reduce prices. If a manufacturer is too\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "conservative in his policies, or is reluctant to abandon outworn\n",
      "machinery or processes, he will be forced by the competition\n",
      "of more progressive firms to adopt new inventions and new\n",
      "methods, all of which will be for the public advantage in the long\n",
      "run. Capitalism therefore has seemed to many to provide a self-\n",
      "regulating principle which secures the best interests of all\n",
      "concerned, and needs no attention from the point of view of ethics\n",
      "except admiration and approval, and no interference by the\n",
      "government.\n",
      "In addition to the above, competition has seemed to be\n",
      "especially adapted to bring out and strengthen qualities of\n",
      "independence of character and self-reliance. It seems to offer a \"fair field\n",
      "and no favors\" to every one. Instead of relying upon personal\n",
      "favor of some one in power, or upon family prestige or inherited\n",
      "property, it seems to make the individual's own ability and efforts\n",
      "the test for success. It has been especially in favor in the United\n",
      "States, because it has seemed to be in accord with conditions in a\n",
      "relatively new country where family and inherited wealth count\n",
      "for less than in older societies. The ethical problems which have\n",
      "arisen in relation to competition are due largely to changes in\n",
      "conditions of industry or business which have either interfered\n",
      "with competition or have caused its failure to work as anticipated.\n",
      "The system has, as it were, grown of itself, fed by the progress\n",
      "of invention, and the enormous increase in production attending\n",
      "this progress, rather than as a result of any definite plan.\n",
      "Nevertheless as the various phases and results of the system have come\n",
      "to be clearly seen, its merits and demerits have been vigorously\n",
      "stated. It secures certain kinds of liberty; does it, or can it, also\n",
      "secure justice? Is it in harmony with the political system of\n",
      "democracy? These questions may be conveniently considered in\n",
      "their ethical aspects under two divisions: on the one hand the\n",
      "industrial process; on the other the business enterprise which\n",
      "owns and manages the industry, markets its products, and\n",
      "receives the profits or incurs the losses.\n",
      "§ 2. Some Ethical Problems of Industry\n",
      "1. In the earlier years of the nineteenth century the\n",
      "textile industries were the first to take advantage of machines and\n",
      "the new power of steam. The great ethical problems were those\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "of protecting the lives and health of workmen. In the language of\n",
      "the economist, Henry Clay,\n",
      "Competition, coupled with the defenseless condition of\n",
      "the workers, tended to make the worst conditions of\n",
      "employment into the standard conditions. The abandonment of\n",
      "sanitary conditions, hours of work, speed of work, exposure to\n",
      "risk of accident from machinery, and the age of the workers\n",
      "to the regulation of competition, made hells of mines and\n",
      "factories.\n",
      "Child labor was used to a degree which now seems incredibly\n",
      "cruel. Factory legislation, first in England where factories began,\n",
      "much later in the United States, checked the worst of these\n",
      "processes. But there is little protection for children in certain of the\n",
      "United States; and it is only in very recent years that any\n",
      "provision has been made for adequate care of sufferers from industrial\n",
      "accidents through workmen's compensation acts. The courts\n",
      "prevailingly took the position that if a workman was of sound\n",
      "mind he assumed the risks of employment, and especially the\n",
      "risks due to the fault of his fellow workmen. The employer could\n",
      "not be held responsible unless he were in some way shown to be\n",
      "at fault, and the State itself assumed no responsibility except that\n",
      "of poor relief to individuals or families in extreme destitution.\n",
      "For the evils of industrial accidents and of child labor, and of\n",
      "excessively long hours for women, competition gave no remedy.\n",
      "As is stated by Henry Clay in the quotation above, it tended to\n",
      "increase rather than diminish these evils; for it tended to make\n",
      "the worst conditions of employment into the standard\n",
      "conditions. An employer who wished to maintain high standards of\n",
      "health and safety, and to pay good wages, was likely to find that\n",
      "a less scrupulous competitor could manufacture at a lower cost.\n",
      "It was therefore only by the intervention of the State that just\n",
      "conditions in industry could be secured. The State could require\n",
      "standards of health and safety, insurance against accidents, and\n",
      "an age limit for the employment of children.\n",
      "This first ethical problem of responsibility for working\n",
      "conditions dangerous to health or to childhood may be said to be\n",
      "decided in principle, however backward certain communities and\n",
      "courts may be in its recognition. That the enormous profits of\n",
      "industry as a whole should disclaim any responsibility for the life\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "and health of those whose labor makes them possible is too\n",
      "outrageous a proposition to be publicly maintained. The labor office\n",
      "connected with the League of Nations is an important\n",
      "recognition of the wide acceptance among all peoples of the principle of\n",
      "social responsibility for conditions which competition tends to\n",
      "make worse instead of to improve.\n",
      "The problems which are most prominent at the present day\n",
      "are rather those of a subtler influence of the machine upon\n",
      "civilization, of security, and of the relations of workers and their\n",
      "organizations to owners and management, including the relations\n",
      "of wages to profits.\n",
      "2. The beginnings of machines in the most general sense are as\n",
      "old as civilization. But it is since the industrial revolution, in\n",
      "which the new power of steam began to be applied through\n",
      "machines of rapidly increasing efficiency and complexity, that men\n",
      "have begun to speak of a \"machine age.\" Samuel Butler in his\n",
      "Erewhon imagined the machines as ultimately becoming all-\n",
      "powerful and ruling the men who had made them. Thorstein\n",
      "Veblen saw the machine as bringing about a division of society\n",
      "into two classes—those who work with machines, and those\n",
      "who do not. Machine-workers, he thought, tend to become\n",
      "mechanized in their habits of thought and thus to resemble the\n",
      "machines which they operate. Machines know nothing of good\n",
      "or bad, right or wrong, joy or pity. They are an embodiment of\n",
      "cause and effect, of force and its channels or modes of working.\n",
      "Men whose whole life is spent with machines tend to adopt\n",
      "similar conceptions, as contrasted with those who deal with legal\n",
      "doctrines, or with money and buying and selling. The machine-\n",
      "workers are thus constantly molded by rigid and grim realities.\n",
      "The other classes deal with symbols and ideas that are more or\n",
      "less artificial and conventional.\n",
      "The influence of machines in industry is reenforced by a trend\n",
      "in industrial management which has tended to substitute for\n",
      "older, closer, and more personal relationships between workmen\n",
      "and employers, a more distant and impersonal relationship\n",
      "between workmen and a corporation. The huge railroads, mines,\n",
      "factories of today are too vast to be owned and controlled, like\n",
      "the old-time stagecoach or loom, by a single individual. The\n",
      "United States Steel Corporation was the first to be capitalized at\n",
      "a billion dollars; but it is no longer alone in this class. General\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Motors, which manufactures various patterns of automobiles,\n",
      "the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, several\n",
      "railroads and banks have capital in excess of a billion.\n",
      "The owners of such enormous properties are the stockholders,\n",
      "but they seldom have any direct knowledge of the industry or\n",
      "share in its management. Management is in the hands of a board\n",
      "of directors who determine its general policies, and trust the\n",
      "carrying out of these policies to an operating staff. And when the\n",
      "property includes various mines, factories, and railway systems,\n",
      "scattered over the country, the central management entrusts local\n",
      "management to subordinate officials. The effect is therefore to\n",
      "remove the workmen farther and farther from the owners, and\n",
      "to make the relationships so impersonal as to resemble the\n",
      "machines. A working class and a white-collar class have come to be\n",
      "recognized as divisions of modern society which have taken the\n",
      "place of the old-time divisions into landlord and tenant, or\n",
      "gentry and common-folk. When we add to the influence of the\n",
      "machine and the corporation the very obvious difference in wealth\n",
      "between the working class and the high executives or principal\n",
      "owners of modern industry, we have the basis for various ethical\n",
      "problems, some of which are on the way to a solution whereas\n",
      "others are far from that point.\n",
      "As regards the immediate effects of the machine upon those\n",
      "who tend it, another charge is that the monotony in certain\n",
      "processes, and the nervous tension occasioned by the high speed or\n",
      "extreme heat or other strains, produce fatigue or exhaustion\n",
      "which deadens the mind or demands some form of exciting\n",
      "diversion, in place of the simpler forms of healthful recreation\n",
      "which really give rest and refreshment to body and mind. The\n",
      "restless and noisy forms of entertainment, the stimulation of\n",
      "vicious indulgence of passions in gambling and sex, the demand\n",
      "for alcoholic stimulants or narcotic drugs, have been attributed\n",
      "to the subtle influence of a machine civilization.\n",
      "Over against such evils, real or alleged, are set unquestioned\n",
      "advantages. The machines are doing the heavy drudgery. They\n",
      "have replaced the slave power of older civilizations. They have\n",
      "broken down the isolation between villages and nations, between\n",
      "regions and continents. They have increased enormously the\n",
      "total of available wealth, and have raised the general standard of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "comfort. Sir Josiah Stamp, the eminent English statistician, has\n",
      "computed that the level of goods and comfort available for the\n",
      "ordinary man has been increased four times by the industrial\n",
      "revolution. The actual number of people who are deadened in\n",
      "mind and body by machine operation is small in comparison\n",
      "with the proportion of society who were formerly deadened by\n",
      "long hours and laborious, heavy work. The working day for a\n",
      "great number has been cut in half. Leisure for various purposes\n",
      "has been made available. An automobile is owned by nearly\n",
      "every family in the United States. And one thing is certain, we\n",
      "cannot drop machinery to go back to the age of handicraft.\n",
      "What then is the ethical problem, and how can it be met? The\n",
      "problem is that of minimizing the bad effects, and of supplying\n",
      "positive values to replace those which have been lost. Under the\n",
      "first head fall such measures as those of restricting the hours of\n",
      "employment to prevent exhaustion or excessive fatigue. The\n",
      "further progress of invention in making it possible for machines to\n",
      "do some of the most monotonous tasks is also not to be\n",
      "overlooked. But the most promising remedy for the mechanizing\n",
      "influence of the machine, and for its displacement of the old-time\n",
      "skill of the craftsman and pride in the workmanlike or artistic\n",
      "value of the product, is to be found in education. Education\n",
      "works at the problem from both ends—that of the producer and\n",
      "that of the consumer. Education, including training in art,\n",
      "enables the manager and his staff to design better garments, better\n",
      "furnishings, better automobiles, better houses. Education of the\n",
      "consumer fits him—or her, for it is in most cases the woman who\n",
      "buys—to appreciate and demand better products in all fields.\n",
      "3. One of the unsolved problems of capitalism is that of\n",
      "insuring measurable stability and security. Under feudal economy\n",
      "there might be a shortage of crops and consequent scarcity, but\n",
      "there was little chance for unemployment. Under machine\n",
      "industry and business management there are fairly regular cycles of\n",
      "prosperity, crisis, depression. In the periods of depression there\n",
      "are surpluses of food and manufactured goods, but little money\n",
      "in the hands of buyers and small confidence in the future. Some\n",
      "depressions may be due to wars. Civilization, however secure,\n",
      "could scarcely sacrifice 13,000,000 men and throw billions of\n",
      "dollars—three hundred or more according to some estimates—\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "into war without suffering, especially when it continues to keep\n",
      "millions under arms and to expend billions for armament yearly.\n",
      "But many panics and depressions occur which are not traceable\n",
      "to wars. They seem rather to result from production with no\n",
      "plan except that of making a profit, and to a reckless speculation\n",
      "based on inflated expectation of future profits and their\n",
      "capitalization. The single-minded pursuit of profit, combined with\n",
      "lack of any far-reaching plans for stabilizing industry, is all that\n",
      "business has thus far been able to offer, and this affords little\n",
      "hope for anything better in the future.\n",
      "The situation is aggravated by the resistance of business and\n",
      "the Federal government to any attempt to deal with\n",
      "unemployment as a national rather than as a local problem. No doubt\n",
      "economy of administration and greater local responsibility are\n",
      "secured. But the effects upon character of making every\n",
      "community look out for its own burdens with no central coordinating\n",
      "agency are deplorable. Each city endeavors to keep its\n",
      "expenditures as low as possible. It fears to get a reputation for\n",
      "generosity lest it be flooded with applicants for aid. It naturally tends\n",
      "to limit relief to residents, and to a single meal or night's lodging\n",
      "for others. \"The next freight train out leaves in an hour. Don't let\n",
      "me see you after it has gone,\" is quoted as a typical warning of\n",
      "the police. So the stream drifts or is driven from city to city, old,\n",
      "middle-aged, and boys. It is not a good training school for the\n",
      "young.\n",
      "Those who do not drift about are little better off. To be idle\n",
      "day after day, month after month, is calculated to discourage the\n",
      "young who need the educative and stabilizing influence of\n",
      "regular employment. For the older worker who has a family\n",
      "dependent on his earnings it presents, at least for the more self-\n",
      "respecting, a desperate alternative. He must suffer himself and\n",
      "see his family suffer, or seek relief from public agencies or private\n",
      "charity. Charity seems a gracious help when flood, fire,\n",
      "earthquake, or pestilence comes as a calamity that could not have\n",
      "been anticipated, but to resort to charity to remedy a situation\n",
      "which ought to be prevented by the economic system is a\n",
      "confession of weakness. For charity places the burden not on those\n",
      "who are able, nor on those who have profited most from\n",
      "previous prosperity, but on those who are willing. Such a method of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "dealing with a situation is not efficient, to say nothing as to\n",
      "justice. To a greater degree than in previous depressions leaders in\n",
      "government and business are now This paragraph was written in the period of depression which followed the\n",
      "crash of 1929, and which still continues in 1932.\n",
      "1 recognizing the responsibility\n",
      "of the community. But it is doubtful whether there will be any\n",
      "escape from the cycle so long as business and industry are left to\n",
      "the unlimited control of the profit motive.\n",
      "It is not so much a question of who is to blame, as it is of what\n",
      "we propose to do about it. Business wishes to be let alone by\n",
      "government, but at the same time it virtually admits that it has no\n",
      "plan, except to make as large profits as possible in times of\n",
      "prosperity, and when depression comes to throw the burdens of\n",
      "unemployment upon charity.\n",
      "The public has thus far been content to deal with the situation\n",
      "as a local matter. But a situation in which six millions out of fifty\n",
      "are unemployed is not a local matter. To treat it as such is to\n",
      "prevent national consideration of the problem and adequate plans\n",
      "for dealing with the whole conduct of industry.\n",

      "§ 1. Conflicting Interests of Employer and Employed\n",
      "1. The industrial revolution has brought a division\n",
      "between classes of employers and employed, and a number of\n",
      "conflicts between their respective interests. Doubtless both classes\n",
      "have a common interest in the prosperity of industry, yet there\n",
      "are several fundamental causes of conflicting interests which give\n",
      "rise to moral problems.\n",
      "Class division is very old. In earlier times it arose largely from\n",
      "conquest of one group by another. The defeated group might\n",
      "become serfs or villeins; the ruling class was free. In England after\n",
      "the Norman conquest the survey recorded in Domesday Book\n",
      "showed that the unfree were greatly in excess of the free. In the\n",
      "following centuries the villein class disappeared. Farmers and\n",
      "farm laborers who worked for wages carried on agriculture;\n",
      "independent traders and craftsmen carried on trade and industry.\n",
      "But the industrial revolution brought back in a new form a\n",
      "distinction between those who owned factories and tools, and\n",
      "directed work, on the one side, and those who performed assigned\n",
      "tasks for wages, on the other. As the revolution has developed\n",
      "through successive stages, there have been shifts in the particular\n",
      "conflicts; in certain respects employers have gained in strength,\n",
      "in others the employed have improved their conditions. But\n",
      "certain conflicts of interest are due, not to any desire on the part of\n",
      "either employer or employed to take an unfair advantage, but\n",
      "rather to the complexity of the question, what is fair? and to the\n",
      "system of bargaining. What are the conflicting interests which\n",
      "divide the community sharply at times of special stress? We\n",
      "select five:\n",
      "(1) The division of the income from the industry; how much to\n",
      "wages, how much to profits?\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "(2) When work is paid by the hour or day, what is a fair (or\n",
      "honest) pace or rate of speed? What justification, if any, for\n",
      "restriction of output?\n",
      "(3) Which party shall control working conditions? Shall shop-\n",
      "rules, and other necessary regulation be determined absolutely\n",
      "by employer, or should there be citizenship in industry as well as\n",
      "in government?\n",
      "(4) Which shall bear the risks of industry? the risks of\n",
      "accident? of unemployment? of premature old age? of disease?\n",
      "(5) Since all four of the above conflicts are bound to be decided,\n",
      "under the system of competition, in favor of the party that holds\n",
      "superior bargaining power, each party will seek to strengthen\n",
      "itself by (1) Organization, massing of forces; (2) Political alliance,\n",
      "either through legislation, or the courts, or by electing friends to\n",
      "office, or by forming a political party. A further factor in\n",
      "bargaining power is the degree to which invention and the machine\n",
      "lessen the requirement of trained skill on the workman's part. If\n",
      "a worker can be taught in a day, the old-time worker's asset of\n",
      "skill acquired by years of experience is lost.\n",
      "Moral considerations appear when we ask, Is it possible to\n",
      "introduce reason and justice into the settlement of these conflicts,\n",
      "or must they be decided solely by force, and the preponderance\n",
      "of power?\n",
      "2. The impersonal character of the relation between employer\n",
      "and employed, while it clarifies certain issues by freeing them\n",
      "from personal ties, sharpens the conflicts. Many problems have\n",
      "their roots in stresses between older policies for carrying on\n",
      "industry, and new methods of machine production and\n",
      "corporation ownership and management. The older policies were based\n",
      "on personal as well as upon employment relations. They were\n",
      "suited to a stage of industry when an employer was himself a\n",
      "worker in the industry, had journeymen and apprentices in\n",
      "his employ, knew them intimately, shared the work with them,\n",
      "needed their labor as they needed his wages, and would not be\n",
      "shocked if his son should marry a daughter of one of the\n",
      "workmen, or conversely if his daughter should marry one of the\n",
      "young workmen who might then aspire to a share in the\n",
      "business. Under those conditions the workman was very nearly upon\n",
      "the same financial and social level as the employer. On the one\n",
      "hand he was fairly able to look out for himself; on the other the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "personal relations made it natural for the employer to deal with\n",
      "the workman as a co-worker rather than as either an inferior or\n",
      "merely as a \"hand\"—No. 12,376 on the pay roll.\n",
      "Contrast the present situation. From the very necessities of\n",
      "machine industry, mass production, and huge factories or other\n",
      "plants, the most effective methods and agencies of production\n",
      "are enormous corporations controlling millions or even billions\n",
      "of capital and employing thousands of laborers. The gap\n",
      "between employer and workman is financial, educational, and\n",
      "social. They live in distinct districts, have different schools, are\n",
      "frequently from different races, and seldom intermarry. The\n",
      "bargaining power of an individual workman when set over against\n",
      "that of a million dollar corporation is practically zero. The\n",
      "personal claim for consideration in case of illness, accident, debt, or\n",
      "other contingency, is also nearly zero. The limit of the\n",
      "impersonal and detached character of modern industrial relations is\n",
      "perhaps the doctrine that labor is a commodity. No doubt it is—\n",
      "like raw materials, rent, and interest—one of the factors to be\n",
      "reckoned with in determining the cost of production. No doubt\n",
      "wages like other factors are subject to market conditions. But to\n",
      "the mind of the worker the implication goes further. It signifies\n",
      "that labor may be bought in the cheapest market irrespective of\n",
      "long and faithful service, that it may be scrapped when the\n",
      "worker is past his period of maximum speed, that in any business\n",
      "depression workmen may be laid off or discharged without\n",
      "regard to the possibility of finding other employment. Even if\n",
      "individual employers may regret such extreme measures,\n",
      "competition of other firms less scrupulous, and the demands of absentee\n",
      "owners for dividends, leave no alternative. It may appear to be\n",
      "an empty gesture to enact, as in Section Six of the Clayton Act of\n",
      "1914, \"that the labor of a human being is not a commodity or\n",
      "article of commerce,\" yet the sentiment of protest behind it has\n",
      "its roots in hard facts.\n",
      "§ 2. Bargaining Power Determines\n",
      "1. Under older conditions it seemed easier to estimate\n",
      "what might be regarded as a fair wage. Older industry was on a\n",
      "comparatively individual basis of production. When the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "wheelwright made a wagon or the cobbler a shoe, or a tailor a suit it\n",
      "was comparatively easy to figure his cost of materials and the\n",
      "time spent in making the product. It was not impossible to reach\n",
      "some estimate of a fair price based on these factors. \"It took me\n",
      "two days and I ought to have four dollars,\" was a common\n",
      "enough formula even within the memory of some now living.\n",
      "But modern enterprise has become cooperative instead of\n",
      "individual. It brings together hundreds or thousands to make the\n",
      "different parts of the tool, the shoe, or the clothing. It takes\n",
      "advantage of a long series of inventions and discoveries. It maintains\n",
      "an extensive selling department. Its prices are necessarily fixed,\n",
      "not by a calculation of the proper return for the worker's time,\n",
      "but upon the market or, in the case of transportation, upon\n",
      "\"what the traffic will bear.\" The cooperative process, combined\n",
      "with the enormous efficiency of power-driven machinery,\n",
      "provides in ordinarily prosperous times a highly profitable enterprise.\n",
      "Who is entitled to the surplus? Evidently three main claims\n",
      "may be put forward—that of the owner-employer, that of the\n",
      "workman, and that of the general public: profits, wages, lower\n",
      "prices to consumers. The older theory considered that\n",
      "competition would be the fairest way to adjust these claims, but it is\n",
      "obvious that in the actual adjustment much will depend upon\n",
      "which of the three is in the stronger strategic position. And thus\n",
      "far the owner-employer has usually been in this stronger\n",
      "position. Nor has he been slow to strengthen it at vulnerable points.\n",
      "To avoid too severe competition he has sought to gain control of\n",
      "natural resources, to prevent by protective tariff foreign\n",
      "competition, to combine forces with competitors, to gain legal\n",
      "protection for a minimum return upon invested capital, and\n",
      "especially, as will be brought out later, to have his capital investment\n",
      "measured for this purpose not by what actually has been put into\n",
      "it but by its income producing capacity. The enormous fortunes\n",
      "built up in America and Western Europe have been acquired\n",
      "largely by the employer-owner class. The consumer may benefit\n",
      "to some extent; and wages have slowly risen in the period since\n",
      "the War, although there was a period from 1900 to 1914 during\n",
      "which no gain in wages was made. But on the whole the immense\n",
      "gains made by modern industrial processes, including those due\n",
      "to science, to invention, and to education, have gone to the\n",
      "owner-employer group.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "2. What is a fair pace or day's work? Two systems are in use\n",
      "for reckoning the adjustment of wages to work: piece-work, and\n",
      "work by the hour or day, or by some longer period. On the piece-\n",
      "work plan the conflict of interest enters in fixing the price to be\n",
      "paid per piece. On the day-wage plan, since the wage is fixed, the\n",
      "conflict appears in the question, How much work shall be given\n",
      "in return? Even in piece-work the question of pace or speed\n",
      "enters, for the workman may calculate that if he works too fast and\n",
      "thereby earns what may seem a high wage, the price per piece\n",
      "will be reduced. Under older conditions, when the employer\n",
      "worked side by side with the other workmen it was easier to set a\n",
      "\"fair\" pace. But under present conditions this question, like that\n",
      "of wages, depends for its answer largely upon the market, i.e.,\n",
      "upon supply and demand. At least the workman is likely to look\n",
      "at it from this point of view, whereas the employer is likely to\n",
      "hold to the older conception of an honest day's work.\n",
      "Limitation of output is of course a well-recognized and\n",
      "fundamental principle of business management. To make more goods\n",
      "than can be sold at a profit is to invite loss, if not disaster. The\n",
      "universally recognized and legitimate method of maintaining\n",
      "prices is to limit the output to what can be sold at a price which\n",
      "will yield a profit. The labor union has adopted a similar policy\n",
      "from motives which illustrate the difference between the\n",
      "psychology of business and that of labor. The laborer feels that in\n",
      "his case, as in that of the employer, the value of his labor depends\n",
      "on supply and demand. If he supplies too much he diminishes to\n",
      "some extent the demand. With a vague fear, especially in\n",
      "seasonal occupations, that there may not be work enough to last he\n",
      "hesitates to \"work himself out of his job.\" This attitude is\n",
      "reenforced by a motive based on the welfare of his fellow\n",
      "workmen, namely, reluctance to set too swift a pace which may result\n",
      "in lowering the rate of wages for piece-work, or in making\n",
      "excessive demands upon the pace of others, or still further in\n",
      "diminishing the amount of work available for others. The constant\n",
      "tendency of invention and scientific management is to displace\n",
      "laborers. The workman sees this process continually going on, as\n",
      "inventions increase. It is liable at any time to deprive him or his\n",
      "fellows of the job which means perhaps the investment of his\n",
      "total training and experience. He has no contract which insures\n",
      "him against dismissal at any moment when the contingencies of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "business and industry make it prudent for the employer to\n",
      "reduce expenses. Why then should he not adopt the policy of\n",
      "sound business management and limit output? But such a policy\n",
      "is not accepted as reasonable either by the employer or by the\n",
      "\"general public.\" The employer argues, \"I pay a fair wage and\n",
      "have right to a full day's work.\" The welfare of industry\n",
      "demands a constant effort to produce goods at low prices, and\n",
      "thereby to extend the market by placing goods within the means\n",
      "of larger and larger numbers of consumers. One way of doing\n",
      "this is by improvements in machinery and management. The\n",
      "other way is by increasing the efficiency of labor. It is only as\n",
      "these two factors are combined that industry can prosper, and\n",
      "employment be stabilized. The general public is naturally\n",
      "interested in low prices for the goods which it must buy. It is therefore\n",
      "inclined to agree with the employer's point of view rather than\n",
      "with that of the union.\n",
      "It is frequently supposed that restriction of output is\n",
      "exclusively a union device and policy. It is true that certain unions,\n",
      "notably in the building trades, have insisted upon fixing a\n",
      "maximum output as a standard, and have thus made a definite claim\n",
      "for a standard of production to match a standard of wages. But a\n",
      "recent investigation has shown that the practice of restriction is\n",
      "by no means confined to organized labor. The same motives\n",
      "assert themselves with unorganized workmen. The practice\n",
      "appears to be general. The answer is to be sought, as in the wage\n",
      "question, in measures to render the bargaining clear in its\n",
      "provisions and standards, and fair in its terms, and this, as will be seen\n",
      "later, means a more nearly equal bargaining power.\n",
      "3. Who shall make working rules and regulate shop\n",
      "conditions, management, or workmen? Perhaps this question has been\n",
      "more bitterly debated than the two preceding questions. This,\n",
      "too, results from the changes introduced by the industrial\n",
      "revolution. For under older conditions the craft-gild determined many\n",
      "matters and the master who determined others was himself also\n",
      "a workman. Under present large-scale production in which ten\n",
      "thousand or a hundred thousand workmen may be employed by\n",
      "a single firm, the separation of management from workmen is\n",
      "inevitable. The plan by which the management makes rules and\n",
      "directs all details of shop conditions has seemed equally inevitable\n",
      "to many employers. On railroads the safety of the traveling\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "public is an additional ground for concentrating authority in the\n",
      "body which is sure to be held responsible for accidents. In some\n",
      "cases the employer has built up the industry largely by his own\n",
      "efforts. He regards it quite naturally as \"his business.\" And there\n",
      "is the general human trait of reluctance to yield power once\n",
      "exercised. Many firms have been willing to grant increases of wages\n",
      "to a point as high as competition with other firms would admit,\n",
      "but have preferred to do this under the pressure of supply and\n",
      "demand, or from their own free will, rather than to admit the\n",
      "union to a voice in shop management. Similarly many firms have\n",
      "found it good policy to reduce excessive hours of labor, to\n",
      "introduce protective devices against dangerous machinery, and to\n",
      "inculcate the maxim, \"Safety First,\" but have been reluctant to\n",
      "accept these same policies when proposed by a labor union. On the\n",
      "other side, the laborer is also human. He likes to have some say\n",
      "about the rules under which he spends the larger part of his day.\n",
      "Moreover, he lives in a democratic age and in a more or less\n",
      "democratic country. If citizenship is a good principle in political\n",
      "life, is there no application for it in industry? To be hired and\n",
      "fired at the will of a superior official, is not made more agreeable\n",
      "by the statement that market conditions require a reduction of\n",
      "the force. To be subject to the whims of a foreman or to\n",
      "impersonal authority seems to lessen not only his security but his self-\n",
      "respect. He probably has never read Aristotle's classification of\n",
      "mankind into the two classes of those fitted by nature to direct,\n",
      "and those fit only to obey the directions of others, but he rebels\n",
      "at Aristotle's conclusion that some men are \"natural slaves.\"\n",
      "4. Which shall bear the risks of industry? We have already\n",
      "mentioned the risks of accident and unemployment, especially\n",
      "unemployment of the seasonal or cyclical type. There is also the\n",
      "unemployment which confronts the workman in all kinds of\n",
      "industry but particularly in machine industry, namely, that due to\n",
      "advancing age. Maximum speed is reached early in life in\n",
      "manual operations; the man of forty who finds himself out of work\n",
      "has a serious problem before him. Under older conditions\n",
      "personal feeling might prevent the discharge of one who had passed\n",
      "his age of greatest efficiency. Many employers have recognized\n",
      "the situation by a system of retiring allowances, but a\n",
      "corporation established for profit is under pressure to keep expenses\n",
      "down and labor efficient. And yet, what can be more\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "disheartening than the fear of dismissal in middle life with the attendant\n",
      "difficulty—or impossibility—of securing another job?\n",
      "§ 3. How Can Bargaining Power Be Kept Equal?\n",
      "Under the system of private property, contract, prices\n",
      "governed by the market, and free competition, the outcome of\n",
      "each of the four conflicts is usually decided largely by the\n",
      "respective bargaining powers of the parties, that is, of owner-employer\n",
      "and of workmen. All the influences of humaneness and instinct\n",
      "of workmanship which enter into the dealings of the parties are\n",
      "liable under pressure to yield to considerations of a seemingly\n",
      "more urgent character. Profits and the maintenance of business\n",
      "standing, on one side, a standard of living and of security, on the\n",
      "other, may drive both parties into positions where self-defense\n",
      "seems to be the first law of nature. The firmest protection against\n",
      "injustice under a capitalistic system is to be sought first of all in\n",
      "keeping the conditions of bargaining such that the two parties\n",
      "shall be as nearly equal as possible in bargaining power. As in\n",
      "military operations, three sources of strength are (1)\n",
      "organization, (2) equipment and (3) allies.\n",
      "1. In organization the employing side has taken and held a\n",
      "strong advantage. The business corporation not only combines\n",
      "the wealth and resources of thousands and even hundreds of\n",
      "thousands of individuals, but it is given immortality by law. As a\n",
      "corporate person it enjoys the protection of the government\n",
      "in the rights of property, and yet it cannot be imprisoned if it\n",
      "defies the law. It is so advantageous a plan for the conduct of\n",
      "great enterprise that it is displacing individual ownership. More\n",

      "production, unite they will be less at a disadvantage, although, even so,\n",

      "the equipment of the parties. The employer's great weapon—to\n",
      "use the military parallel—is the machine. The workman's greatest\n",
      "asset was his skill. An all-round workman—carpenter, smith,\n",
      "mason, tailor, weaver—could not be trained in a day. Experience\n",
      "increased his competence. He could not be easily replaced by a\n",
      "casual and ignorant applicant for a job. Machinery brings about\n",
      "the splitting-up of such a task as making a coat or shoe or tool\n",
      "into a number of distinct steps, each performed by a machine. To\n",
      "learn to tend these machines requires various periods of time,\n",
      "but seldom if ever does it require anywhere nearly as much time\n",
      "as to learn the whole craft; and many machines require in the\n",
      "operator neither intelligence nor skill. Under these conditions\n",
      "the strongest asset and source of security which the old-time\n",
      "workman possessed tends to become less and less. How can he\n",
      "bargain on equal terms when he not only must deal with a vast\n",
      "corporation, but has less protection through the very mechanism\n",
      "of modern industry? So far as equality in bargaining power is\n",
      "dependent on equipment, the balance is hopelessly weighted\n",
      "against the workman.\n",
      "3. Neither side is content to rely solely on its own strength.\n",
      "Each seeks aid from the government in securing its ends. The\n",
      "employer seeks protection for his property; the workman seeks\n",
      "protection for his life, health, and safety, and for prevention from\n",
      "competition by child labor and unlimited immigration. The\n",
      "workman has sought help from legislatures, and these have\n",
      "responded with child-labor laws, and employers' liability laws.\n",

      "Congress restriction of immigration. Limitation of the hours of\n",
      "employment for women, and in certain occupations, such as\n",

      "Law is usually more backward than public opinion. Especially\n",
      "is this true of the decisions of the courts, because these are based\n",
      "in part upon custom which in turn reflects past opinion and past\n",
      "habits of thought. In both English and American law, the\n",
      "tradition has been that of individual rights with assumed equality of\n",
      "bargaining power. Monopolies, i.e., special privileges given by\n",
      "grants of king or Parliament, were indeed jealously watched. But\n",
      "no differences arising from wealth or poverty were taken into\n",
      "account. It was, however, also in the tradition that what might be\n",
      "lawful for one person might be unlawful if done by a group; for\n",
      "in the latter case it might fall under the conception of a\n",
      "conspiracy. The individual laborer in dealing with the corporation may\n",
      "be, in actual bargaining power, in the ratio of one to a million.\n",
      "The court refuses to recognize the facts, and finds it more in\n",
      "accordance with the principles of American life to regard every\n",
      "person as equal to every other person. Further, when the\n",
      "individuals in a union try to bring combined strength, the corporation is\n",
      "treated as a single person although it consists of many owners. It\n",
      "is therefore entitled to all the economic standing of a single\n",
      "person, and according to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal\n",

      "certain employers have adopted the policy of the \"open shop,\"\n",
      "meaning by this that no one belonging to a union will be\n",
      "employed. Believing that it is lawful for workmen to unite, and that\n",
      "this affords a means to give them a measure of equality in\n",
      "bargaining power with the great corporations, both Congress and\n",
      "the state of Kansas passed laws forbidding the discharge of\n",
      "workmen, or refusal to hire workmen, because of membership in\n",
      "a union. But the United States Supreme Court in each case\n",
      "declared such a law to be unconstitutional. Adair v. U.S., 208 U.S. 161 (1908); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915).\n",

      "employee have equal rights:\n",
      "The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as\n",
      "he deems proper, is in its essence, the same as the right of the\n",
      "purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he\n",
      "will accept such labor from the person offering to sell it. So\n",
      "the right of the employee to quit the service of the employer,\n",
      "for whatever reason, is the same as the right of the employer,\n",
      "for whatever reason, to dispense with the services of such\n",
      "employee. . . . In all such particulars the employer and the\n",
      "employee have equality of right, and any legislation that\n",
      "disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the\n",

      "inequality. And apparently he regards it not only difficult but\n",
      "legally unjustified for the courts to recognize any attempt to\n",
      "compensate such inequality by protecting the right of workingmen to\n",
      "combine. The Kansas state court had previously upheld the law\n",
      "which made it unlawful \"to coerce, require, demand or influence\n",
      "any person not to join or become or remain a member of any\n",
      "labor organization or association, as a condition of, securing\n",
      "employment.\" The Kansas court said, \"the employees as a rule\n",
      "are not financially able to be as independent in making contracts\n",
      "for the sale of their labor as are employers in making contracts of\n",
      "purchase thereof.\" But Justice Pitney said in reply:\n",
      "No doubt, wherever the right of private property exists,\n",
      "there must and will be inequalities of fortune; and thus it\n",
      "naturally happens that parties negotiating about a contract\n",
      "are not equally unhampered by circumstances. . . . Since it is\n",
      "self-evident that, unless all things are held in common, some\n",
      "persons must have more property than others, it is from the\n",
      "nature of things impossible to uphold freedom of contract\n",

      "are the necessary result of the exercise of those rights. These cases are discussed in Commons, Legal Foundations of Capitalism,\n",

      "There are two principles at stake in both the Adair case and\n",
      "the Coppage case: in the first place, whether the courts can\n",
      "recognize economic inequality as something which justifies public\n",
      "interference with contracts, as they have for a long time\n",
      "recognized physical force, or threats, or undue influence of some\n",
      "superior, as constituting a proper ground for such interference; and,\n",
      "in the second place, whether some public purpose is clearly\n",
      "discernible in such a measure as the Kansas law, in as much as laws\n",
      "forbidding employment in dangerous occupations, e.g., mines\n",
      "and smelters, have been upheld in a previous leading case. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 (1898).\n",

      "On both points it was possible, so far as legal precedents were\n",
      "concerned, to decide either for or against the law in question, as\n",
      "is evidenced by the fact that the dissenting opinion in Coppage\n",
      "v. Kansas was signed by three justices of the Court whose\n",
      "learning in the law cannot be questioned (Day, Holmes, and Hughes).\n",
      "The issue was not one of law but of public policy and justice\n",
      "in the broad sense. On the side of the majority it may fairly be\n",
      "said that, if economic inequality were recognized as having\n",
      "coercive power, many contracts would be rendered uncertain; for it is\n",
      "frequently possible for debtor or creditor, merchant or\n",
      "manufacturer, as well as for the laborer, to find himself under such\n",
      "financial stress as leads to contracts which he would not make if he\n",
      "could wait for a more favorable time, and the courts are\n",
      "therefore reluctant to make a decision which might involve such\n",
      "possibilities of indefinite voiding of contracts. On the other hand the\n",
      "court in Holden v. Hardy had very definitely recognized that\n",
      "new conditions might arise in the development of industry which\n",
      "would call for the protection of the weaker party by the State.\n",
      "Shall such protection be extended to the laborer's wage contract\n",
      "as well as to his health? Those who adhere to one type of public\n",

      "recognize no public purpose in a trade union which would justify\n",
      "the government in protecting it, whereas in the case of\n",
      "protection for health and morals the right of the State had a clear\n",
      "precedent in its favor. On the other hand it may be urged that if it is\n",
      "regarded as lawful for workmen to associate in order to improve\n",
      "their conditions, it is only logical to prevent action by\n",
      "corporations designed to destroy such associations. Undoubtedly earlier\n",

      "of the frontier, and the approximate economic equality of the\n",
      "people of the United States in the earlier years, fixed such\n",
      "policies firmly in legal attitude and precedent. The ethical question\n",

      "conception.\n",
      "The question of economic inequality receives further\n",
      "treatment in the so-called Hitchman case. Hitchman Coal and Coke Co. v. Mitchell, 245 U.S. 229 (1917).\n",
      "4 In this case the matter at\n",
      "issue was not a statute passed by a legislature but an injunction\n",
      "forbidding a union and its agents from persuading employees of\n",
      "a coal company to join a union, as a step toward unionizing the\n",
      "mines. It appeared that all employees of the company were\n",
      "required as a condition of employment to agree not to belong to a\n",
      "union while working for the company. The injunction forbade\n",
      "the labor union to interfere with such contracts. Injunctions are\n",
      "issued by the court to prevent some damage to property for\n",
      "which there would be no adequate legal remedy in an ordinary\n",
      "suit. For example, to use Justice Taft's illustration, if a man\n",
      "attempts to cut down a tree to which I claim ownership it will give\n",

      "through unions, and extending the field of union power.\" The\n",

      "is entitled to the good will of its employees, precisely as the\n",
      "merchant is entitled to the good will of his customers. . . . The right\n",
      "of action for persuading an employee to leave his employer is\n",
      "universally recognized.\" This appears to be in many respects the\n",
      "severest ruling since the days when all unions were treated as\n",
      "conspiracies. If any company can prevent any union of its\n",
      "employees by the simple method of requiring a contract, and then\n",
      "can summon to its support all the forces of government under a\n",
      "legal process which makes the judge who issues the injunction\n",
      "the authority to decide upon its alleged violations, and to punish\n",
      "all violators for contempt of court, what remains of the alleged\n",
      "lawfulness of associations for mutual benefit? This is apparently\n",
      "reduced to an ironical mockery. It amounts to saying, \"Organize\n",
      "if you dare!\" The contract which the injunction supports has\n",
      "been called by union sympathizers a \"yellow dog contract.\" It is\n",
      "certainly one-sided. The company is supposed to offer a job; the\n",
      "employee to agree not to belong to a union. But the company is\n",
      "under no obligation to continue to employ the laborer for as\n",
      "long as he stays out of the union. It is under no obligation to\n",
      "employ him for more than a single day. The consideration\n",
      "offered, namely, that of a job, may be canceled at any time at the\n",
      "whim of a foreman, or by conditions in the market over which\n",
      "the workman has no control, or by the illness of the employee. If\n",
      "there was ever a case of \"Heads I win; tails you lose,\" this may\n",
      "fairly claim to be the outstanding example. With the forces of\n",
      "the law so heavily against them, it is small wonder that labor\n",
      "unions have not been more successful in the United States. It\n",
      "is not surprising that laboring men have great distrust of the\n",
      "courts, and believe that their point of view has little chance of\n",
      "receiving fair treatment.\n",
      "One reason for the unfavorable situation of the laborer before\n",
      "the law is that whereas the employer can stand upon the well-\n",
      "recognized rights of property, the workman's interest is in\n",
      "securing and maintaining a standard of living.\n",

      "The law does not recognize that the workman has any legal\n",
      "claim to a standard of living. It holds that if there is no physical\n",
      "coercion every one has an equal chance; and that justice consists\n",
      "in just this. The workman feels the pressure of supporting a\n",
      "family, and perhaps compares his lot with that of others more\n",
      "favored; he feels justified in bringing all pressure possible upon the\n",
      "employer. Those who would take his place he calls \"scabs,\" and\n",
      "regards them as traitors to their fellows. The public sides\n",
      "sometimes with one party, sometimes with the other. It is likely to\n",
      "sympathize with workmen as against a great corporation, unless\n",
      "the strike causes serious inconvenience not only to the employer\n",
      "but to the public itself, as, for example, when a railroad is forced\n",

      "employer's conditions, on the one hand; and no job, which spells\n",
      "starvation, on the other, his \"freedom\" does not seem to be of\n",
      "great value. Of course the theory of competition is that different\n",
      "employers will be competing for the services of the workman,\n",
      "and this will insure good wages. In highly prosperous times this\n",
      "has a measure of truth. But when in accordance with modern\n",
      "tendencies various competing firms in a given type of industry\n",
      "combine, competition is reduced to a minimum; and when times\n",

      "In this chapter we consider certain moral problems\n",
      "connected with the other half of our productive process, namely,\n",
      "with the business side.\n",
      "§ 1. The Profit Motive\n",
      "Industry is the making and distributing and in general\n",
      "the providing of goods. Business has to do with the management\n",
      "and financing of industry. Its primary purpose is profits. The\n",
      "theory of capitalism is that this motive will secure the greatest\n",
      "efficiency in business and therefore the greatest production, that it\n",
      "will secure the production of the kind of goods which society\n",
      "most needs and wants, and thus will secure the greatest welfare\n",
      "of all in the long run. The theory as formulated by Adam Smith\n",
      "presupposed that if each seeks his own advantage he will\n",
      "necessarily prefer that employment which is most advantageous to\n",
      "society.\n",
      "The individual neither intends to promote the public interest\n",
      "nor knows how much he is promoting it by directing\n",
      "industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest\n",
      "value, but intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in\n",
      "many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end\n",
      "which was no part of his intention. Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations.\n",
      "1\n",
      "There are many industries in which this seems to be the case. To\n",
      "furnish an article which many want is one way to large profits.\n",
      "Makers of automobiles, of telephones, of radios, have profited\n",
      "by supplying necessary and eagerly desired goods and services.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "On the other hand it is by no means so easy at the present time to\n",
      "suppose that the profit motive is the infallible key to a just\n",
      "distribution of benefits, or to fine types of products, or to social\n",
      "welfare. Let us examine certain of the facts which give rise to the\n",
      "above queries.\n",
      "1. The great advantage which is claimed for the profit motive\n",
      "is that it gets things done. It is efficient. It stimulates invention\n",
      "and production, and results in greater wealth than can be\n",
      "produced in any other way. The rapid increase in the total wealth of\n",
      "England during the earlier part of the nineteenth century, of the\n",
      "United States since the Civil War, and of Germany in the early\n",
      "years of this century, are cited in support of this claim.\n",
      "The per capita wealth and income of the United States\n",
      "certainly show an enormous and fairly steady increase. The estimate\n",
      "of the national income in the United States by the National\n",
      "Bureau of Economic Research in 1921 was that the national income\n",
      "had increased in the period, 1909 to 1918, from 28.8 billions to\n",
      "61 billions; or, making allowance for the rise of prices during the\n",
      "war, from 30 to 38.8 billions, giving a per capita income in 1918\n",
      "of $372.00. Since 1918 the increase has continued until the total\n",
      "income is estimated at 84 billions, and the per capita income at\n",
      "$692.00. It is of course true that much of this increase is due to\n",
      "invention under the guidance of science; and that the motive of\n",
      "great scientists is seldom predominantly that of profits.\n",
      "Nevertheless the figures are certainly impressive. And it may further be\n",
      "said, as Professor Mitchell has stated, that if a business man\n",
      "cannot secure profits he will soon be compelled to go out of\n",
      "business. No one has unlimited resources, and to conduct a business\n",
      "at a loss for an indefinite period is merely a form of economic\n",
      "suicide.\n",
      "Some work is fascinating. On the other hand, many kinds of\n",
      "work are not. The most successful way to get such kinds of work\n",
      "done appears to be that of offering a reward adequate to call out\n",
      "the effort of those who will take great risks, or do difficult and\n",
      "irksome tasks for the sake of large returns. Under the regulation\n",
      "of competition it is held that rewards cannot long continue to be\n",
      "excessive, and that the simplest way to find out what the\n",
      "community wants and needs is to make it profitable to supply wants and\n",
      "needs.\n",
      "2. The first defect alleged is that the profit motive by no means\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "always leads to service of the public by supplying public wants.\n",
      "Sometimes greater profits can be made by restricting the supply,\n",
      "and thus raising the price of goods and services. With the\n",
      "organization of the principal lines of business and industry in great\n",
      "corporations, which frequently control the supply of natural\n",
      "resources, it is increasingly difficult to suppose that competition\n",
      "automatically turns the seeker for profits to methods which\n",
      "supply public needs. A considerable portion of profits is sought, not\n",
      "by the supply of necessities as such, but by control over the\n",
      "supply, or by speculation in which there is no thought of rendering\n",
      "any equivalent to the public for the profits received. Such a craze\n",
      "for unearned profits as marks various periods of wildcat\n",
      "speculation—such as, for example, culminated in 1929 in the United\n",
      "States, in what was characterized by a financial authority as the\n",
      "most gigantic gamble of history—result in transfer of profits\n",
      "from the less shrewd to the more shrewd, but divert the interests\n",
      "and activities of many from serving the public to a method of\n",
      "getting something for nothing.\n",
      "Nor does the profit motive necessarily give to consumers what\n",
      "they need or want. It is now a commonplace that the balance has\n",
      "shifted. Instead of making what consumers want, the theory now\n",
      "is to produce large supplies, and then to sell them to consumers.\n",
      "If the consumers do not want the things offered, then their \"sales\n",
      "resistance\" must be overcome. Salesmanship and advertising are\n",
      "relied upon to awaken new wants where none exist, and the total\n",
      "effect is often discontent rather than content.\n",
      "A third charge is that the profit motive fails to secure\n",
      "production of fine quality. Frequently there is more profit in cheap and\n",
      "shoddy goods than in durable and substantial articles. It has\n",
      "even been found profitable to appeal to the salacious and\n",
      "unwholesome in commercial amusements. Those who are\n",
      "concerned for the higher and finer types of work in education, in\n",
      "drama, in music, and in many other fields, fear the profit motive.\n",
      "\"Commercialized\" art or literature or journalism seems as\n",
      "contrary to the best types as \"commercialized\" medicine or religion.\n",
      "3. Highly important is the question of waste of natural\n",
      "resources. Under the administration of President Roosevelt\n",
      "attention was called to the exhaustion of the great natural resources\n",
      "of forests, mines, oil, which was threatened by the methods of\n",
      "treatment then practiced. Under the influence of the profit\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "motive, forests were cut off with no provision for replanting. It\n",
      "would not pay a private owner to make such provision for the\n",
      "needs of future generations, and so nothing was done to replace\n",
      "forests, even on land unsuitable for any other purpose. The\n",
      "methods of mining coal were wasteful in that they extracted only\n",
      "a part of the coal in a given tract, and left the remainder in such\n",
      "condition as would not permit any further extraction. Attempts\n",
      "have been made to guard against waste in oil, but the desire for\n",
      "immediate profits has been so strong as to encourage a large\n",
      "amount of wasteful exploitation. Even more disastrous in its\n",
      "ultimate possibilities is the exhaustion of the soil in certain parts of\n",
      "the country by the washing away of exposed bare soils into the\n",
      "rivers, and so into the ocean or the Gulf of Mexico.\n",
      "The difficulty is not that corporations or individual farmers\n",
      "are more shortsighted and wasteful than the average of mankind\n",
      "but rather that the profit motive itself works directly against the\n",
      "future welfare of the country, instead of toward a far-sighted\n",
      "policy which takes account of the welfare of coming generations.\n",
      "The whole tendency of American conditions, due to the\n",
      "seemingly inexhaustible supplies of coal, oil, metals, timber, and\n",
      "virgin soil, has been to encourage the wasteful tendency. The profit\n",
      "motive, which in the case of many a small business encourages\n",
      "thrift and saving, has not only been powerless in the case of these\n",
      "large resources but has reenforced the natural carelessness and\n",
      "free spending attitude. \"Easy come, easy go\" has in large\n",
      "measure been true of our capitalistic system in respect to natural\n",
      "resources.\n",
      "§ 2. The Difficult Problem of Justice\n",
      "We have seen that capitalism has proved to be an\n",
      "effective method of increasing the total wealth and income of the\n",
      "countries in which it has had its fullest trial. The question which\n",
      "has been raised with increasing insistence is, how are the wealth\n",
      "and income distributed among the different members of the\n",
      "various peoples under this system? This is to raise the question of\n",
      "justice.\n",
      "So far as the average man, and particularly the laboring man\n",
      "or farmer or the man in petty trade or in clerical work is\n",
      "concerned, it may be that the question of productive efficiency is\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "more important than the question of distribution. If there is so\n",
      "meager a total production as to permit no comfort for the mass\n",
      "of people it would not better their condition greatly if there were\n",
      "an equal distribution. In times past this has largely been the case.\n",
      "When the per capita income was only $300.00, few could have\n",
      "more than the bare necessities. Now that the per capita income\n",
      "has increased greatly, comforts and even luxuries such as\n",
      "automobiles, radios, modern plumbing, well-heated dwellings, are\n",
      "within the possibility of a large number of the population.\n",
      "Arguing from this it is sometimes thought foolish to raise the question\n",
      "of distribution. So long as the general level is rising, what does it\n",
      "matter if some are rising faster than others? The general spirit of\n",
      "American life has undoubtedly been to think of success as a\n",
      "game which is open to all, with prizes for those who win. The\n",
      "disposition has been to applaud the winner rather than to\n",
      "complain because he was more successful than his fellows. And a\n",
      "further fact of importance was that nothing was definitely known as\n",
      "to the distribution of wealth in the United States, although\n",
      "European countries were better informed. At present the distribution\n",
      "of wealth is less accurately known than the distribution of\n",
      "incomes, but there are sufficient data to afford basis for discussion\n",
      "of the principle involved. So far as opportunities to enjoy\n",
      "comforts and goods of life including education, as well as material\n",
      "necessities, are concerned, income is the more important. Many\n",
      "persons who receive good salaries spend them as they go along.\n",
      "They provide for death or old age by insurance. On the other\n",
      "hand when we think of influence and power in society, wealth is\n",
      "the more important. The individuals or corporations that have\n",
      "great available wealth can undertake great enterprises. They\n",
      "control for better or worse the wages and living conditions of great\n",
      "numbers. They exercise influence in church and state. If then we\n",
      "are thinking of social welfare in all its aspects we cannot pass by\n",
      "the question of justice.\n",
      "But what is a \"just\" distribution? Several answers have been\n",
      "given of which we mention four which are typical.\n",
      "§ 3. Four Theories of Just Distribution\n",
      "1. Give to each what he earns. This sounds fair. In simpler\n",
      "conditions of society, when each man made an entire product\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "such as a bow or a piece of cloth, it might be possible so to\n",
      "arrange prices as roughly to give to each man what he earned. But\n",
      "in the present age of industry, when the labor of hundreds or\n",
      "thousands enters in a complex process of manufacture,\n",
      "transportation, and sale, this is obviously impossible.\n",
      "2. Give every man what he can get through his ability, his\n",
      "shrewdness, his advantageous economic position due to\n",
      "inherited wealth, and every other factor which adds to his bargaining\n",
      "power, as regulated by free competition. This is the existing\n",
      "method under capitalism.\n",
      "Here once more present conditions have profoundly changed\n",
      "the rules of the contest. On the one hand, corporations with\n",
      "enormous aggregations of wealth have taken the place of\n",
      "individual bargaining; on the other, labor unions have endeavored to\n",
      "even up conditions, to strengthen their bargaining power, by\n",
      "collective strength. The interest of the consumer who does not\n",
      "belong to either class is to some extent protected in Europe by\n",
      "cooperative societies; in the United States, however, these have not\n",
      "been successful. This method is no doubt a practicable method\n",
      "of division, but there is a serious question whether it can be\n",
      "called just. So far as the working of the system is concerned it\n",
      "appears that the outcome is similar in Prussia, France, Great\n",
      "Britain, and the United States. The concentration of wealth in the\n",
      "richest group is highest in Great Britain where capitalism has\n",
      "been in effect longest. But the trend is similar.\n",
      "According to the estimates of W. I. King, if we divide the\n",
      "population in the four countries into four classes—(1) the poorest,\n",
      "comprising sixty-five per cent; (2) the lower middle, comprising\n",
      "fifteen per cent; (3) the upper middle, comprising eighteen per\n",
      "cent; and (4) the richest, comprising two per cent—the first class\n",
      "owns approximately five per cent, the second class five per cent,\n",
      "the third class thirty per cent, the fourth class sixty per cent of\n",
      "the wealth. If one had a hundred dollars to divide among one\n",
      "hundred people it is doubtful whether one would divide it in this\n",
      "proportion, although of course the question as to whether this\n",
      "would be just would depend upon principles which we have not\n",
      "yet fully examined. Many defenders of capitalism have been\n",
      "shocked by the extraordinary inequality shown in this estimated\n",
      "division by which two out of every hundred have more wealth\n",
      "than the other ninety-eight, and have challenged the accuracy of\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the figures. The Federal Trade Commission, however, in its\n",
      "report for 1926 studied and estimated the disproportion to be even\n",
      "greater.\n",
      "If we turn to the distribution of income we have more\n",
      "adequate data. The National Bureau of Economic Research in 1921\n",
      "estimated that, in 1918,\n",
      "the most prosperous one per cent of the income receivers had\n",
      "nearly 14 per cent of the total income, the most prosperous\n",
      "5 per cent of the income receivers had nearly 26 per cent of the\n",
      "total, the most prosperous 10 per cent of the income receivers\n",
      "had nearly 35 per cent of the total, and the most prosperous\n",
      "20 per cent of the income receivers had about 47 per cent of\n",
      "the total income. Income in the United States, 1921, p. 147.\n",
      "2\n",
      "More recent estimates in the report of the Hoover Commission\n",
      "show a slight gain in the proportion of income going to the less\n",
      "well-to-do.\n",
      "What gives us pause in accepting the distribution of wealth as\n",
      "just, is the fact that the modern world and especially the people\n",
      "of the United States entertain two social theories with which it is\n",
      "difficult to reconcile the existing distribution. The first is the\n",
      "theory that, in certain respects at least, men are equal. In political\n",
      "affairs we give each man and each woman one vote. We have\n",
      "never on any general scale attempted to apply this to wealth, and\n",
      "yet it is hard for us to suppose that an inequality of a million to\n",
      "one (if we take extremes) is quite representative of justice in a\n",
      "democratic society.\n",
      "The second doctrine is that to some extent at least reward\n",
      "ought to be proportionate to the service or contribution which\n",
      "the individual makes to the common wealth. Some of the great\n",
      "fortunes are unquestionably the result of great services, but\n",
      "others are acquired through shrewdness in diverting the flow of\n",
      "wealth into the individual's pocket rather than by any actual\n",
      "contribution to this flow. In other words, \"something for nothing\" is\n",
      "not infrequently a maxim which yields a great fortune to the\n",
      "shrewd manipulator of securities or gambler in futures.\n",
      "3. A third possible theory of just distribution would be to give\n",
      "an equal share to every one. Mr. Bernard Shaw, a member of the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "group of so-called Fabian socialists, advocates this as the right\n",
      "principle. The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism.\n",
      "3 The difficulty with this from the point of view of\n",
      "justice is that it too fails to give sufficient weight to the differences\n",
      "among men, not only in ability but in willingness to do their\n",
      "share of work. In other words it applies one type of equality, but\n",
      "fails to make the further application of distributing equal returns\n",
      "to equal contributors, and proportionate returns to the unequally\n",
      "valuable contributions.\n",
      "4. A fourth principle would abandon, in part at least, the\n",
      "attempt to distribute justly on the basis of giving to each man a\n",
      "precise equivalent for his contribution, or of giving him an equal\n",
      "share on the basis of the assumed equality of all human beings,\n",
      "or on the basis of what he can get in the market. It substitutes\n",
      "as the primary consideration, a regard for the public good or\n",
      "what the common law and the older writers had in mind by the\n",
      "common wealth. It asks what is a good condition of society, and\n",
      "what standard of living is necessary or conducive to a good\n",
      "society. The best example of the working of this principle is seen in\n",
      "our system of public education. The leading concern in our\n",
      "public school system has been, not primarily to produce a few\n",
      "exceptional scholars, nor to give superior advantages to members of\n",
      "certain social or economic classes; but to give all a minimum\n",
      "of education, and to those who can profit by it such\n",
      "opportunities for further education as are believed to be essential and\n",
      "desirable for the welfare of people as a whole. If we should apply\n",
      "this same principle to economic distribution it would insist upon\n",
      "a minimum that would not merely prevent actual starvation, but\n",
      "would in any country of abundant wealth make possible the\n",
      "necessaries and some of the comforts of present civilization.\n",
      "Yet while it may be impossible to give to each a precise\n",
      "equivalent for his contribution, the principle that every man who\n",
      "receives should make his contribution is fundamental to this fourth\n",
      "theory of just distribution. One of the greatest sources of the\n",
      "feeling of injustice is that too often those who work hardest—such\n",
      "as the laborers in many kinds of agriculture and industry, and\n",
      "those whose contributions are of the highest value to\n",
      "civilization, such as the inventor or scientist—are poorly paid; whereas\n",
      "many who have never done a stroke of useful work enjoy by\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",

      "charged a higher price in some other town where there was no\n",
      "competition, and thus made up the loss. A similar practice was to\n",
      "cut prices on some one article called a \"fighting brand.\" A very\n",
      "effective use of power, when the same group of owners controls\n",
      "both the railroads and coal or iron mines, is to charge\n",
      "competitors high freight rates. In other cases it may secure such\n",
      "special rates or rebates from a railroad as to place competitors at a\n",

      "The most radical measure in the field of social control\n",
      "which the United States has thus far adopted is the Sixteenth\n",
      "Amendment to the Federal Constitution. This authorizes\n",
      "Congress to lay a tax upon incomes. The amendment was adopted\n",
      "in 1913.\n",
      "There was, to be sure, nothing novel in its principle. European\n",
      "countries had for a long time relied upon an income tax for a\n",
      "substantial part of their revenue, and had employed a graded\n",
      "scale by which those who received larger incomes should pay a\n",
      "higher rate of tax. In the original Federal Constitution of the\n",

      "                            \n",
      "United States was a provision that Congress should have no\n",
      "power to levy a direct tax except on the basis of population. This\n",
      "meant that a tax levied upon the rich could be no larger than the\n",
      "tax upon the poor. Since a tax levied on this basis would be\n",
      "obviously impossible unless it were extremely small, the result was\n",
      "that Congress resorted to other forms of taxation in order to\n",
      "raise money needed for carrying on the Federal government. The\n",
      "chief reliance was upon customs, i.e., taxes upon articles\n",
      "imported from other countries; and upon \"internal revenue,\" taxes\n",
      "levied chiefly upon manufacture and sale of alcoholic liquors and\n",
      "tobacco. Both these forms of taxation were upon articles of\n",
      "consumption. A poor man with a large family might need to\n",
      "purchase more sugar than a rich man with a small family. In so far\n",
      "as the tax on such necessaries as sugar was concerned, the tax\n",
      "fell far more heavily in proportion upon the poor than upon the\n",
      "rich. With regard to alcoholic liquors and tobaccos the theory\n",
      "was that these were luxuries rather than necessities. But after all\n",
      "the taxes were burdens which pressed heavily upon the poor. No\n",
      "attempt was made to distribute burdens in proportion to ability\n",
      "to pay. The same feeling of discontent with existing inequalities\n",
      "which had already led to factory legislation, to control of public\n",
      "utilities, and to restraint of monopolies and trusts—culminating\n",

      "gone into disuse. The Supreme Court in 1895 had declared such\n",
      "a tax unconstitutional, to the bitter disappointment of many.\n",
      "The only legal way to overcome this obstacle was by an\n",
      "amendment to the Constitution; but amendments to the Constitution\n",

      "In addition to efforts of organized society to right some\n",
      "of the wrongs of the capitalistic system there are also certain\n",
      "tendencies at work which are believed by many to have great\n",
      "promise. Perhaps the most conspicuous is that given prominence by\n",
      "Mr. Henry Ford. This speaks with greater authority because it\n",
      "has actually worked to a considerable degree in Mr. Ford's own\n",
      "industry. Mr. Ford holds that the method of mass production\n",
      "enables the efficient manager to do four things:\n",
      "(1) To reduce prices and thereby benefit consumers and extend\n",
      "the use of products; (2) to raise wages and thereby, not only to\n",
      "improve morale, but still further to extend the market for\n",
      "products by enabling workmen to become customers; (3) to shorten\n",
      "hours; and (4) to increase profits.\n",
      "It may be alleged that the automobile industry offered an\n",
      "exceptionally favorable field for mass production; and that other\n",
      "factors, for example, national prohibition of the manufacture\n",
      "and sale of intoxicants, have operated to increase the purchasing\n",
      "power of the people. Nevertheless, the policy of high wages and\n",
      "low prices, as contrasted with the earlier theory that low prices\n",
      "could be achieved only by low wages, is a genuine contribution\n",
      "to business principles.\n",
      "Another tendency, to which Professor Carver has directed\n",
      "attention, is called by him \"the present economic revolution in the\n",
      "United States.\" T. N. Carver, The Present Economic Revolution in the United States, Boston,\n",
      "1926.\n",
      "1 \"It is a revolution,\" he claims,\n",
      "that is to wipe out the distinction between laborers and\n",
      "capitalists by making laborers their own capitalists and by\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "compelling most capitalists to become laborers of one kind or\n",
      "another, because not many of them will be able to live on the\n",
      "returns from capital alone. This is something new in the\n",
      "history of the world.\n",
      "Instead of continuing to fight capital they [laborers] are\n",
      "beginning to recognize its power and to use it as an\n",
      "implement for their own improvement. There are at least three\n",
      "kinds of evidence that indicate roughly the extent to which\n",
      "laborers are becoming capitalists: first, the rapid growth of\n",
      "savings deposits; second, the investment of laborers in the\n",
      "shares of corporations; third, the growth of labor banks.\n",
      "It may well be doubted whether the extent to which laborers\n",
      "own stocks and bonds is likely to give them any large measure of\n",
      "participation in the control of industry. It is usually the preferred\n",
      "stock, which has no voice in the control of industry, that is\n",
      "offered to employees. And yet of course the common stock with its\n",
      "risks is frequently purchasable in the market, and in time\n",
      "laborers may come in this way to have a voice in control.\n",
      "A third tendency, emphasized by Mr. Owen D. Young of the\n",
      "General Electric Company, is that of separating management\n",
      "from ownership. This separation has been carried far in certain\n",
      "great corporations. When ownership and management were\n",
      "combined in the same individual, ownership, actuated by the\n",
      "profit motive, was likely to dictate policies without sufficient\n",
      "regard to any other consideration than that of profits. But when\n",
      "ownership comes to be vested in a great number of stockholders,\n",
      "and when an industry such as the electric industry, involves\n",
      "technical skill, scientific research, and the ability to secure\n",
      "harmonious working relations with great numbers of employees, the\n",
      "situation requires an expert and broad-minded staff for its\n",
      "successful management. Such a staff cannot so easily be compelled\n",
      "to think only of profits. It is itself largely on a salaried basis. It\n",
      "is frequently more interested in making an excellent grade of\n",
      "goods, and in gaining public favor, than it is in immediate\n",
      "profits. Such a management, Mr. Young claims, considers not only\n",
      "the advantage of the owner but also the welfare of workmen and\n",
      "responsibility to the public.\n",
      "A fourth tendency has been the formation of associations\n",
      "which have adopted codes of business ethics, or have emphasized\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "the standard of \"service.\" Certain practices calculated to lower\n",
      "the public esteem for business morals have been condemned by\n",
      "such ethical codes. It is true that they have not usually attacked\n",
      "fundamental issues; and such associations as the Rotary, Kiwanis,\n",
      "Lions, Optimists, have been more or less derided as aiming\n",
      "rather at good luncheons than at drastic reforms. And yet they\n",
      "are symptomatic of a tendency to be dissatisfied with present\n",
      "conditions; and the maxim of \"service\" is certainly better than\n",
      "the all too general maxim—none the less acted upon, even if not\n",
      "so openly expressed—of \"something for nothing,\" which so\n",
      "largely governs speculation.\n",
      "A drastic change in the attitude and conduct of corporations is\n",
      "believed by many to be imperative. It is claimed that since\n",
      "corporations are given valuable privileges by the public they should\n",
      "make the public interest primary. This is already the theory as\n",
      "regards the so-called public service corporations; other\n",
      "corporations should adopt the same view of their responsibility; if they\n",
      "will not do so of their own accord, they should be placed under\n",
      "government supervision and control. This would give what\n",
      "Professor Wormser calls \"a socialized corporate capitalism.\" Frankenstein, Incorporated.\n",
      "2 The\n",
      "corporation is organized \"for profit,\" and hence is a conspicuous\n",
      "example of what the naked profit motive may induce. The profit\n",
      "often seems to be regarded as profit for the promoters at the\n",
      "expense of credulous investors, as when stock of no actual value is\n",
      "issued and sold. Again it is interpreted as profit for the high\n",

      "socialism has as yet made little headway in the United States is the\n",
      "great and liberal scale on which public education has been\n",
      "conceived and measurably carried out in the United States. The aim,\n",
      "as stated by the late President Angell of the University of\n",
      "Michigan, that every child might see a path from the door of his home\n",
      "to the state university, has been generously furthered,\n",
      "particularly in the newer states. And despite the expressed fears of\n",
      "some, that too many are seeking higher education, it is not likely\n",
      "that the public system will close its doors to its young people.\n",
      "If then the present economic system is likely to continue, it is\n",
      "all the more important to consider how some of its worst abuses,\n",
      "wastes, injustices, may be remedied at least partially. We have\n",
      "already noted six points at which organized society has interfered\n",

      "property, free enterprise, free contract, and free competition. Some of\n",
      "these measures—notably factory laws, stabilization of finance\n",
      "and to some extent of public utility charges, the income tax—\n",
      "have marked progress. Others such as the Sherman Act have been\n",
      "of doubtful value. It is moreover evident that though for certain\n",
      "ends we may properly rely upon law and public administration,\n",
      "there are other ends which can be gained only through education\n",
      "and a change of attitude both in producers and in consumers. We\n",
      "may roughly divide the field into (1) problems of increasing\n",
      "production and decreasing waste; (2) problems of security; (3)\n",
      "problems of protecting workmen and especially women and children\n",
      "against dangerous processes and machinery, against excessive\n",
      "hours, fatigue, and unsanitary conditions; (4) problems of\n",
      "improving the wisdom and good taste of consumers of goods, and\n",
      "of raising standards for recreation, as contrasted with\n",
      "commercialized standards; (5) problems of juster distribution of the\n",
      "enormous gains in economic processes—juster both as measured\n",
      "by service to the community, and as measured by the\n",
      "requirements of a functional society.\n",

      "§ 4. Improvements Needed\n",
      "1. Increasing production and decreasing waste.\n",
      "Increasing production is largely an engineering problem. Great strides\n",
      "have been made in this direction. A constantly increasing ratio of\n",
      "power—hydraulic, steam, electric—available through tapping\n",
      "new sources of supply and through its more efficient utilization,\n",
      "constantly improved organization, and in many cases better\n",
      "cooperation between management and workmen, have resulted in a\n",
      "rising rate of efficiency. The profit motive is of course enlisted\n",
      "toward this end. It is not wholly an engineering problem in the\n",
      "ordinary sense of the term, because the willingness of workmen\n",
      "to cooperate in increased production, is dependent in part upon\n",
      "their expectation of sharing in the returns created by this\n",
      "cooperation. Yet if we take engineering in the most inclusive sense this\n",
      "may well comprise such a consideration of the human factor as\n",
      "will lead to juster distribution.\n",
      "Prevention of waste might also be thought to be an\n",
      "engineering problem. As regards methods, it is such. Extraordinary\n",
      "savings have been made in electric lighting, in the generation of\n",
      "power from steam, in the means of transportation. An example of this on a small scale which nevertheless is typical came under\n",
      "the writer's observation. A coal distributing business is now carried on with\n",
      "two trucks and their drivers, which formerly required forty men and onehun-dred\n",
      "hundred twenty horses.\n",
      "4 And these\n",
      "economies have resulted in lowering of costs, in preventing waste\n",
      "of coal, and in many cases in the lowering of prices to\n",
      "consumers, and thus to a wider market. But the engineer under\n",
      "capitalism does not always have a free hand. Whether he is permitted\n",
      "to save or not depends on whether it is more profitable to save\n",
      "or to waste. In the case of the management of forests and the\n",
      "reforestation of cut-over areas, it has thus far seemed more\n",
      "profitable to waste than to save or reforest. European countries have\n",
      "been successful in keeping forests and their management under\n",
      "public ownership and control. The Federal government still has a\n",
      "considerable area under the charge of a national forestry system,\n",
      "and a few experiments have been made in state or municipal\n",
      "forestry. Even in Massachusetts, where the courts have been\n",
      "extremely conservative in protecting private business from public\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "competition, towns are allowed to own forests. In the extraction\n",
      "of oil a recent movement of owners to cooperate in reducing\n",
      "waste has promise. But natural gas has for the most part been\n",
      "recklessly wasted.\n",
      "2. A further field in which up to the present time the engineer\n",
      "has been unable to prevent waste is that of unemployment. In\n",
      "this case his inability is not due directly to the profit motive,\n",
      "because the recurring periods of depression in industry and\n",
      "business are as yet imperfectly understood. Government supervision\n",
      "of banking has indeed reduced the \"money panics\" which\n",
      "private management was utterly incapable to prevent. But the\n",
      "business cycle is still not under control. Certain shrewd and powerful\n",
      "individuals may very likely profit by the opportunity to buy back\n",
      "at a low price the securities which at the crest of a prosperity\n",
      "wave they sold to the trustful public. Yet they cannot be charged\n",
      "with total responsibility for depressions. The heaviest burden\n",
      "rests upon the shoulders of those who are thrown out of\n",
      "employment, and who never had sufficient margin of income over\n",
      "expense to lay by for the rainy day. The American plan has been to\n",
      "let them look out for themselves, and to let their families suffer\n",
      "except as relieved by charity. Europe has provided for the risks of\n",
      "unemployment, as well as for those of accident, illness, and old\n",
      "age. Mr. Rubinow says:\n",
      "Every period of unemployment in this country [the United\n",
      "States] results in increased mendicancy, increased\n",
      "applications to charitable organizations, both private and public,\n",
      "increased crime, disease, and general demoralization, a sum\n",

      "legislatures. But the very fact that American workmen have been\n",
      "able to be more provident than those of Europe has delayed\n",

      "The argument that social insurance is \"paternalistic\" or\n",
      "\"socialistic\" or \"German\" is convenient hokum.\n",
      "3. The principle that life and health should not be sacrificed to\n",
      "profits is seldom denied openly. Much has been done both by\n",
      "private initiative and by public control to safeguard workmen, and\n",
      "especially women and children. Much, however, still remains to\n",
      "be done. Since the Great War some of the states have undertaken\n",
      "to rehabilitate and reeducate those crippled in industry,\n",
      "following the example of the nation in rehabilitating those crippled in\n",
      "war. The general reaction against liberal and humanitarian\n",
      "activities on the part of government, which was manifest in many\n",
      "directions, has apparently postponed any successful attempt to\n",
      "establish a national protection of children against premature\n",
      "employment. Nevertheless it may be doubted whether state action\n",
      "will be adequate. In the meantime, however, those who live in\n",
      "states which have no protection against child labor, or\n",
      "inadequate protection, may work to improve local standards. The\n",
      "whole movement for labor legislation is scarcely more than a\n",
      "generation old in the United States, and it is premature to despair\n",
      "of further progress. Some form of public health insurance is\n",
      "probably also necessary to provide adequate medical and\n",
      "hospital service for those with small incomes.\n",
      "4. Improvement of taste on the part of consumers, and of\n",
      "better standards of goods. If problems under (1) were primarily for\n",
      "the engineer, and problems under (2) primarily for government,\n",
      "problems of improving the taste of consumers and the standards\n",
      "of goods are primarily problems of education. The profit motive\n",
      "is not adequate as we have already seen. This has worked well in\n",
      "the case of automobiles, for these have improved in both beauty\n",
      "and utility.\n",
      "On the other hand, this motive has failed almost utterly in\n",
      "providing dwellings of better quality. No doubt modern\n",
      "dwellings are better equipped as to plumbing, lighting, and heating,\n",
      "than those available a generation ago. But the congestion of\n",
      "cities, the hideous surroundings of the ordinary workingman's\n",

      "or for the recreation of adults, except in so far as the city itself\n",
      "has stepped in to provide parks and playgrounds—these show\n",
      "the profit motive nearly at its worst. As engineers are limited by\n",
      "profits, so architects who would like to plan generously are\n",
      "restricted by rents and profits. Courts do not allow the government\n",
      "to supply more healthful dwellings, and hence the ultimate\n",
      "remedy appears to be in the general education of the consumer to\n",
      "demand a different type of dwelling. The sphere of government\n",
      "is limited to preventing, under housing and zoning laws, the\n",
      "more outrageous violations of sanitation and good taste, and to\n",
      "the positive provision of free spaces for public parks and\n",
      "playgrounds. The newer parts of the country have been able to secure\n",
      "far more adequate space for children's play, than the older\n",
      "portions in which it was assumed that no provision need be made by\n",
      "the public. Adulteration of foods is another instance in which the\n",
      "profit motive cannot be trusted. Law in this case has stopped\n",
      "some of the worst practices in the case of foods. It is, however,\n",
      "impossible to prevent by law all kinds of trickery and deception.\n",
      "Education, with the increased application of scientific\n",
      "standards for quality, is indispensable. Above all, it is education to\n",
      "which we must look for improvement in standards of art,\n",
      "literature, and recreation. Legislation may prevent some of those\n",
      "practices of commercial recreation, and commercial art and\n",
      "literature, which are most shocking to morality. But it cannot\n",
      "insure a more healthful taste. In this field, as distinguished from\n",
      "that of the automobile, the greater profit seems to lie in the\n",
      "worse products. The moving pictures, the jazz music, the comic\n",
      "strips, and various other forms of popular entertainment, are not\n",
      "an object of pride to those who have learned to know good art,\n",
      "good music, and good literature. A civilization, in which the\n",
      "average man spends his day in a factory and his evening at a\n",
      "movie, has still a long way to go.\n",
      "5. Just distribution. As already noted, the conception of just\n",
      "distribution may be approached in several ways. We found it\n",
      "extremely difficult and indeed impossible to say how much each\n",
      "contributes, and hence that it is impracticable to determine how\n",
      "much each deserves to receive from the great pool into which go\n",
      "the accumulated knowledge and skill of past generations, the\n",
      "genius of the discoverer and inventor, the patient labors of the\n",
      "  \n",

      "scientist, the order and tranquillity and social standards so\n",
      "necessary for peaceful production, and the taste and sensitiveness to\n",
      "color, form, and sound which are our inheritance from the past.\n",
      "The only promising approach is rather by the path which Plato\n",
      "suggested when he asked what was necessary for a good society.\n",
      "On behalf of inequality in wealth it may be argued that more\n",
      "capital will be available for business enterprise if wealth is\n",
      "distributed as at present, and it may be granted that in the past this\n",
      "has in many if not in all cases been true. If we take the\n",
      "illustration of dividing a thousand dollars among one hundred men it is\n",
      "probable that if each received $10.00 he would expend it on\n",
      "some present need; whereas if ninety men received $1.00 each,\n",
      "and if nine more received $40.00 each, and the one hundredth\n",
      "man received the balance of $550.00, it is probable that the last\n",
      "named man would be inclined to use at least a part of the $550.00\n",
      "for some new venture. But at present we recognize that this may\n",
      "be overdone. If the great mass have only sufficient income to\n",
      "maintain a meager standard of living, the market for goods will\n",
      "be correspondingly limited. The rich man cannot consume\n",
      "indefinitely. The mass of men provide the great market. It is by the\n",
      "constant education of greater and greater numbers to use more\n",
      "and better goods that the market is widened and sustained. The\n",
      "movement, which some far-sighted employers have initiated, of\n",
      "paying better wages in order to increase the number of\n",
      "consumers is commended by economists as tending in a wise direction.\n",
      "Unfortunately the case of the farmer is more difficult. There\n",
      "are many advantages from the point of view of the general\n",
      "welfare in the continuance of small holdings and independent farms.\n",
      "On the other hand, it may be that it will prove impossible to\n",
      "resist the trend toward larger units, which has gone so far in the\n",
      "industrial world. In the meantime the farmer receives low prices\n",
      "for his goods, and pays high prices for what he must buy; while if\n",
      "he needs help he must compete with the wages paid by industry.\n",
      "Efforts toward a juster distribution of gains need not be\n",
      "limited to better wages. Society through public agencies is\n",
      "constantly doing more for its members. The outstanding example is\n",
      "of course the system of public education. Most communities\n",
      "provide books as well as buildings and teachers. Public libraries,\n",
      "public parks and playgrounds, have done much to counteract the\n",
      "evils of city congestion. Such inventions as the automobile and\n",

      "science. Generous gifts to hospitals and education, and\n",
      "endowments for research in all lines, are continually making better\n",
      "standards of life possible.\n",
      "It is sometimes objected that such activities by the public tend\n",
      "to limit private enterprise, with the self-help and independence\n",
      "which has been so important a factor in modern society. On the\n",
      "other hand, it is more probable that the opening of wider doors,\n",
      "to all sorts and conditions of men, by education and acquaintance\n",
      "with the finer things of life, will more than even the balance.\n",
      "Looking at our economic life in the light of what we have\n",
      "learned from Hebrew and Greek, and from modern conceptions\n",
      "of scientific method and fuller life—we may say that a good\n",

      "as to the various goods which are desirable, should take account\n",
      "of all the human relations, and should move toward raising all\n",

      "been the ideal and aspiration not only of the finer spirits but of\n",
      "increasing multitudes in the modern world.\n",
      "§ 5. A Distorted Perspective\n",
      "We have considered some of the merits and defects of\n",
      "our present order with respect to justice, liberty, and equality. In\n",
      "conclusion, we note what is perhaps the most serious question\n",
      "of all, namely, that of the proper perspective. If the economic\n",
      "dominates life—and if the economic order relies chiefly upon the\n",
      "profit motive as distinguished from the motive of professional\n",
      "excellence, i.e., craftsmanship, and from the functional motive of\n",
      "giving a fair return for what is received—there is danger that a\n",
      "part of life, which should be subordinate or at most coordinate\n",
      "with other interests and values, may become supreme. It is as\n",
      "true now as when the words were uttered that life is more than\n",
      "meat. And when wealth is made a chief if not the sole interest,\n",
      "some of the precious and finer things of life—love, justice,\n",
      "knowledge, beauty—are liable to be displaced. Referring to the\n",
      "unlimited exercise of powers in the acquisition of wealth, and the\n",
      "conception that to this pursuit there is no limit other than that\n",

      "The family ideally considered has one end, the common\n",
      "good of all its members, but this has three aspects. (1) Marriage\n",
      "converts an attachment between man and woman, either of\n",
      "passion or of friendship, into a deliberate, intimate, permanent,\n",
      "responsible union for a common end of mutual good. It is this\n",
      "common end, a good of a higher, broader, fuller sort than either\n",

      "give it greater depth and reach than ordinary friendship. (2) The\n",
      "family is the great social agency for the care and training of\n",

      "The division of the sexes appeals to the biologist as an\n",
      "agency for securing greater variability, and so greater possibility\n",
      "of adaptation and progress. It has also to the sociologist the\n",
      "value of giving greater variety in function, and so a much richer\n",
      "society than could exist without it. Morally, the realization of\n",
      "these values, and the further effects upon character noted above,\n",
      "depend largely upon the terms under which the marriage union\n",
      "is formed and maintained. The number of parties to the union,\n",

      "and wife, parents and children, while in the family relation, have\n",

      "been interrupted by certain halts or even reversions.\n",
      "The early family, certainly in many parts of the world, was\n",
      "formed when a man left his father and mother to \"cleave unto\n",
      "his wife,\" that is, when the woman remained in her own group\n",
      "and the man came from his group to live with her. This tended to\n",

      "wife's fidelity, the father's authority over the children and\n",
      "interest in them, and finally the permanence of the family. The power\n",
      "of the husband and father reached its extreme among western\n",
      "peoples in the patriarchate at Rome, which allowed him the right\n",
      "of life and death. At its best the patriarchal type of family\n",
      "fostered the dignity and power of a ruler and owner, the sense of\n",

      "is likely to appear also in the matter of divorce. Among many\n",
      "savage peoples divorce is easy for both parties if there is mutual\n",
      "consent, but with the families in which father right prevails it is\n",
      "almost always easier for the man. The ancient Hebrew might\n",
      "divorce his wife for any cause he pleased, but there is no mention\n",
      "of a similar right on her part, and it doubtless did not occur to\n",
      "the lawgiver. The code of Hammurabi allows the man to put\n",

      "measure of freedom for their women. In fact, they, like other peoples,\n",
      "might be said to have satisfied the two principles of freedom and\n",
      "control by allotting all the freedom to the men and all, or nearly\n",
      "all, the control to the women. Hobhouse thus summarizes the\n",
      "conditions:\n",
      "The power of the husband was strongly developed; he\n",
      "might expose the infant children, chastise his wife, dispose\n",
      "of her person. He could not put her to death, but if she was\n",
      "unfaithful, he was, with the consent of the relations, judge\n",
      "and executioner. The wife was acquired by purchase from\n",
      "her own relatives without reference to her own desires, and\n",
      "by purchase passed out of her family. She did not inherit in\n",
      "early times at all, though at a later period she acquired that\n",
      "right in the absence of male heirs. She was in perpetual ward,\n",
      "subject, in short, to the Chinese rule of the three obediences,\n",
      "to which must be added, as feudal powers developed, the rule\n",
      "of the king or other feudal superior. And the guardianship\n",
      "or mundium was frankly regarded in early law rather as a\n",
      "source of profit to the guardian than as a means of defense to\n",
      "the ward, and for this reason it fetched a price in the market,\n",
      "and was, in fact, salable far down in the Middle Ages. Lastly,\n",
      "the German wife, though respected, had not the certainty\n",

      "                            \n",

      "German tribes, but this, we have seen, is universally the case\n",
      "where the numbers of the sexes are equal. Polygamy was\n",
      "allowed, and was practiced by the chiefs.\n",
      "The influence of the church on marriage and family life was in\n",
      "two conflicting lines. On the one hand, the homage and\n",
      "adoration given to Mary and to the saints, tended to exalt and refine\n",
      "the conception of woman. Marriage was, moreover, treated as a\n",
      "\"sacrament,\" a holy mystery, symbolic of the relation of Christ\n",
      "and the church. The priestly benediction gave religious\n",
      "sacredness from the beginning; gradually a marriage liturgy sprang up\n",
      "which added to the solemnity of the event, and finally the whole\n",
      "ceremony was made an ecclesiastical instead of a secular\n",
      "function. Howard, History of Matrimonial Institutions, I., ch. vii.\n",
      "2 The whole institution was undoubtedly raised to a more\n",
      "serious and significant position. But, on the other hand, an\n",
      "ascetic stream of influence had pursued a similar course, deepening\n",
      "and widening as it flowed. Although from the beginning those\n",
      "\"forbidding to marry\" had been denounced, it had nearly always\n",
      "been held that the celibate life was a higher privilege. If marriage\n",
      "was a sacrament, it was nevertheless held that marriage made a\n",
      "man unfit to perform the sacraments. Woman was regarded as\n",
      "the cause of the original sin. Marriage was from this standpoint\n",
      "a concession to human weakness. \"The generality of men and\n",
      "women must marry or they will do worse; therefore, marriage\n",
      "must be made easy; but the very pure hold aloof from it as from\n",
      "a defilement. The law that springs from this source is not\n",
      "pleasant to read.\" Pollock and Maitland, Hist. Eng. Law, II., 383, quoted in I., Howard, 325-\n",
      "326.\n",
      "3 It must, however, be noted that, although celibacy\n",
      "by a selective process tended to remove continually the finer,\n",
      "more aspiring men and women, and prevent them from leaving\n",
      "any descendants, it had one important value for woman. The\n",
      "convent was at once a refuge, and a door to activity. \"The career open\n",

      "the consent of the parties was the only thing necessary to\n",
      "constitute a valid marriage. \"Here the church had not only to combat\n",
      "old tradition and the authority of the parents, but also the\n",
      "seignorial power of the feudal lord, and it must be accounted to it\n",
      "for righteousness that it emancipated the woman of the servile as\n",
      "well as of the free classes in relation to the most important event\n",
      "of her life.\" Hobhouse, op. cit., I., 218.\n",
      "5 The other was that in maintaining as it did the\n",
      "indissolubility of the sacramental marriage, it held that its\n",
      "violation was as bad for the husband as for the wife. The older\n",
      "theories had looked at infidelity either as an injury to the husband's\n",
      "property, or as introducing uncertainty as to the parenthood of\n",
      "children, and this survived in Dr. Johnson's dictum of a\n",
      "\"boundless\" difference. The feelings of the wife, or even of the husband,\n",
      "aside from his concern for his property and children, do not\n",
      "seem to have been considered.\n",
      "The church thus modified the Germanic and Roman\n",
      "traditions, but never entirely abolished them, because she was divided\n",
      "within herself as to the real place of family life. Protestantism, in\n",
      "its revolt from Rome, opposed both its theories of marriage. On\n",
      "the one hand, the Reformers held that marriage is not a\n",
      "sacrament, but a civil contract, admitting of divorce. On the other\n",
      "hand, they regarded marriage as the most desirable state, and\n",
      "abolished the celibacy of the clergy. The \"subjection of women,\"\n",
      "especially of married women, has, however, remained as the\n",
      "legal theory until very recently. In England it was the theory in\n",
      "Blackstone's time that \"The very being or legal existence of the\n",
      "woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is\n",
      "incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband, under whose\n",
      "wing, protection, and cover, she performs everything.\"\n",
      "According to the old law, he might give her \"moderate correction.\" \"But\n",
      "with us in the politer reign of Charles II., this power of\n",
      "correction began to be doubted.\" It was not until 1882, however, that a\n",
      "married woman in England gained control of her property. In the\n",

      "§ 2. Recent Changes in Society and Ideas Which Affect the Family\n",
      "As the family is probably the oldest among human\n",
      "institutions—older than government as a separate factor, and\n",
      "probably older than separately organized religion—it is also\n",
      "eminently the institution which concerns men and women in\n",
      "daily living. Rooted biologically in sex it has drawn strength\n",
      "from economic, religious, political, and artistic sources. Shifts\n",
      "from the maternal to the paternal type, or from polygamy to\n",
      "monogamy, have been so gradual as to tend toward greater strength\n",
      "rather than toward a lessening of permanence and community of\n",
      "relationship. The gradual lengthening of the period of education\n",
      "has been an influence toward a continuance of the bond of\n",
      "common interest in children, which has made for greater unity\n",
      "between parents. At the present time, however, a conjunction of\n",
      "forces seems to be working in the opposite direction. Economic,\n",
      "political, religious conditions form a background for\n",
      "revolutionary ideas.\n",
      "Economic changes, and the urban life which is largely the\n",
      "result of them, are the first and perhaps the most serious\n",
      "underlying factor in the situation. The family and home of former times,\n",
      "while rooted in sex and parental relations assumed a pattern\n",
      "largely shaped by the need of division of labor between husband,\n",
      "wife, and children, and by community of property, particularly\n",
      "of a stable dwelling, the home. This dwelling was often a centre\n",
      "of industry, recreation, and religion. The division of labor\n",
      "between man and woman, after culture had reached the higher\n",
      "hunting or agricultural stage, was that man should bring home\n",
      "the game or work in the field while woman prepared food and\n",
      "cared for the house. They were thus interdependent. A man\n",
      "found himself largely helpless in preparing food and especially in\n",
      "caring for children. The woman was correspondingly at a\n",
      "disadvantage in hunting game or working in the fields, although in\n",
      "many cases she might take part in this. All the work as well as\n",
      "the enjoyments of life tended to centre in the home.\n",
      "The industrial revolution sent both men and women into\n",
      "factories. It took even children in large numbers. The first effect of\n",
      "industrial change was therefore upon the working class—the\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "economically poorer strata of society—in which the work of\n",
      "both man and wife was necessary to maintain existence and\n",
      "support children. While this did little to break legal ties which bound\n",
      "husband and wife, it did impoverish the life of the home. Even\n",
      "from well-to-do families it removed nearly all the domestic arts\n",
      "and crafts, except that of preparing food, and thus left the\n",
      "business of the housewife far less important and interesting. The\n",
      "Civil War in the United States was the occasion for the entrance\n",
      "of larger numbers of women into the teaching profession.\n",
      "Inventions such as the telephone called for women operators; business\n",
      "development made room for stenographers, clerks, secretaries,\n",
      "department heads, and executives. Many women from middle\n",
      "and well-to-do classes have come to enjoy the outside contacts\n",
      "and economic independence which such employments make\n",
      "possible. Public education fits them for efficient service.\n",
      "The drift of population to the cities affects marriage and\n",
      "family life in several ways. The marriage rate in cities is lower than in\n",
      "the country, due in part to the higher cost of renting and\n",
      "furnishing dwellings in the city. Expense tends to discourage many\n",
      "young married people from raising a family. Children seem\n",
      "particularly out of place in a modern city apartment; but any city\n",
      "dwelling, with little or no opportunity for convenient play space,\n",
      "seems a poor place for a child to thrive in. No one, says Russell,\n",
      "would undertake to grow young trees in separate cellars in\n",
      "the city.\n",
      "Modern inventions have displaced the home as a centre of\n",
      "enjoyment also. The automobile to some extent opposed family\n",
      "disintegration, because the tendency was for the family to move\n",
      "about together, but it brought also new perils. The moving-\n",
      "picture which has become a leading type of recreation also\n",
      "invites the whole family, but like the automobile it takes the family\n",
      "away from home. The city dwelling tends to become smaller and\n",
      "smaller. It has no best room, in which the young people can\n",
      "entertain their friends. The old neighborhood relationships which\n",
      "were based on the mutual acquaintance of families have\n",
      "practically ceased to exist. The younger generation finds its own\n",
      "recreation and enjoyment not only apart from the parents but\n",
      "without the supervision of parents and neighbors, which although\n",
      "usually friendly was nevertheless real under older conditions.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "The automobile, the night club or dance hall, and other present\n",
      "forms of diversion, are not favorable to common participation\n",
      "by parents and children.\n",
      "Changes in the external conditions of family and home have\n",
      "been accompanied by radical changes in ideas.\n",
      "First came a modification of view as to divorce. In England\n",
      "until 1857 absolute divorce with the right to remarry had been\n",
      "possible only by an act of Parliament. Between 1800 and 1850\n",
      "only ninety such acts were passed. The Act of 1857 established a\n",
      "court to hear and adjudicate procedures. Divorce was granted to\n",
      "the husband on the ground of adultery and to the wife if she\n",
      "could prove not only adultery on the part of the husband but\n",
      "also some aggravation of that act or addition to it, as by\n",
      "desertion. But even after this Act of 1857 divorce continued to be\n",
      "infrequent in England, ranging for the remainder of the century\n",
      "from about 300 to about 1,000 divorces (including judicial\n",
      "separations) annually. In the United States (except in South Carolina\n",
      "which grants no divorce) legal divorce has been easier than in\n",
      "England. It has, however, increased rapidly since 1870. In that\n",
      "year 10,962 divorces were granted; in 1930 there were 191,591.\n",
      "The population had increased from 38.5 millions to about three\n",
      "times that number; the divorces had increased to about\n",
      "seventeen times as many as the number in 1870. Or looking at the\n",
      "matter from another angle, the divorces now average about one\n",
      "to every six marriages—fewer in the East, more in the West and\n",
      "Southwest; fewer in agricultural life, more among actors,\n",
      "musicians, telegraph and telephone operators, and commercial\n",
      "travelers; fewer among rural, more among urban residents.\n",
      "Change in social attitude has been correspondingly striking. In\n",
      "1870, divorce in the Eastern states, at least, was not good form.\n",
      "The view, which is still registered by the British royal court in the\n",
      "regulation that divorced persons are not presented at court, was\n",
      "virtually the prevailing view in American society. At present,\n",
      "however, when religious restraints are no longer so widely felt,\n",
      "and when the ratio of divorce to marriages is about one to six or\n",
      "seven, there is little mental and social opposition to be overcome\n",
      "if husband or wife becomes dissatisfied. The increase of divorce,\n",
      "which has been steady since 1870 and as yet shows no sign of\n",
      "lessening, has given rise to anxiety, for it seems to indicate a\n",
      "radical change in the attitude toward marriage.\n",
      "  \n",
      "                            \n",
      "Yet this increase in divorce, unfortunate as it often is for the\n",
      "children, is not the most serious phase of the situation. With the\n",
      "common tendency in America to enter upon marriage chiefly\n",
      "upon the basis of emotion, it is not surprising that difficulties of\n",
      "adjustment—intellectual, economic, social, and sexual—often\n",
      "prove too great. Companionship may then fail to supervene\n",
      "when the first flush of emotion has passed. Statistics show that\n",
      "where there are no children, discontent is especially likely to\n",
      "follow. Divorce, however, does not necessarily imply that the\n",
      "institution of marriage is a failure, for divorced persons not\n",
      "infrequently marry again in the hope of a more successful union. The\n",
      "more radical threats to the family are found, not in divorce, but\n",
      "in certain attitudes toward the desirability of any family life.\n",
      "The first of these attitudes is that sex relations are a purely\n",
      "individual matter, in which no one except the parties concerned\n",
      "has any rightful interest. It is held by some representatives of this\n",
      "view that the coming of children does create a situation which\n",
      "society may properly recognize in requiring provision for their\n",
      "care. The second attitude goes still further. It would not place\n",
      "responsibility for the care and upbringing of children upon the\n",
      "parents. It maintains that this responsibility can better be\n",
      "assumed by society itself through proper experts. The tendency of\n",
      "either of the above theories would be to remove much if not all\n",
      "social, legal, and moral support from the institution of the\n",
      "family, and to encourage casual attachments instead of permanent\n",
      "unions. We may consider the bearings of these theories first from\n",
      "the point of view of the man and woman, and secondly as they\n",
      "affect children.\n",
      "These more radical questionings of the institutions of\n",
      "marriage and family spring from (1) an increased emphasis upon sex,\n",
      "and (2) an expansion of individualism, already powerful\n",
      "economically and politically, to a new significance in personal\n",
      "relations, particularly those of sex.\n",

      "In two respects the situation seems easier. When women at\n",
      "first began to consider gainful occupations after marriage there\n",
      "was a distinct prejudice against this on the part of husbands. It\n",
      "appeared to them to be a reflection upon their ability to support\n",
      "a wife. Support was a duty recognized by law. It was perhaps not\n",
      "surprising that they failed to recognize that a woman might have\n",
      "as strong a bent toward some profession or career other than\n",
      "housework as her husband, and that it would be unjust to\n",
      "deprive her of an opportunity for constructive work and a creative\n",

      "this attitude on the part of intelligent men. The point is not at all\n",
      "that a man cannot \"give her what she wants\" in the way of\n",
      "money. The point is rather that she wishes the opportunity to do\n",
      "her own work in the world. For some the work she may prize\n",
      "most and find best suited to her capacities will lie in the making\n",
      "of a home and in the care and education of her children. But\n",
      "something like twenty per cent of college women have no\n",
      "children, and for many of these a life entirely limited to a city\n",
      "apartment would be empty. The woman of today does not care to live\n",
      "in \"The Doll's House.\" In another respect, economic conditions\n",
      "have improved with the general advance of woman to suffrage\n",
      "and citizenship, namely, in provision for a proper distribution of\n",
      "family income between husband and wife without the necessity\n",
      "for the wife's \"asking the husband for money.\" No one of mature\n",
      "years likes to be put in the position of asking another for money.\n",
      "Husband and wife are supposed to engage in a partnership\n",
      "according to the old Roman formula, \"a partnership in the whole of\n",
      "life.\" Income may be earned by one or by both. In any case,\n",
      "expense ought to be shared, and the necessary income distributed\n",
      "according to the items for which each partner is individually\n",
      "responsible. Twenty-five years ago, the irritation caused by the\n",
      "status which was then common was frequently severe, and was\n",

      "The question of authority within the home is likewise\n",
      "progressing with the general advance in educational and political\n",

      "one case, there are too few children, in the other too many.\n",
      "Birth control clinics to the number of seventy at this writing\n",
