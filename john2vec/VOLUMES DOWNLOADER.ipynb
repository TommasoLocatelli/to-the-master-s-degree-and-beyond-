       " 'Early Essays\\nThe Metaphysical Assumptions of Materialism [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVI\\n(April 1882), 208-13. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nDiscussions regarding materialism have been, for the most\\npart, confined to the physiological and psychological aspects\\nof it. Its supporters and opponents have been content to\\nadduce arguments pro or con, as the facts of physical and\\nmental life bear upon the case in hand. It is the object of the\\npresent paper to discuss its metaphysical phases.\\nHume suggested that possibly one might escape from\\nthe nihilistic consequences of his philosophy by means of\\n\"the sceptical solution of sceptical doubts.\" In a somewhat\\nanalogous manner we would attempt to render explicit the\\nmetaphysical assumptions (i.e., assumptions regarding the\\nreal nature of things) latent in all materialism, and, by\\nshowing the relation of these fundamental assumptions to\\nmaterialism itself, show the self-destructive character of\\nevery scheme of this kind—whether actual or possible.\\nWhat is materialism? It is that theory which declares\\nthat matter and its forces adequately account for all°phenom-ena\\nphenomena-those of the material world, commonly so called, and\\nthose of life, mind, and society. It declares that not only the\\ncontent of mind, but that which we call mind itself, is\\ndetermined by matter. We notice first, then, that it is°abso-lutely\\nabsolutely monistic. But one substance exists-matter. All°phe-nomena\\nphenomena of mind are really phenomena of matter. The°intel-lect\\nintellect is a function of the brain and its subordinate nervous\\norgans. The laws of matter are therefore the laws of mind.\\nMental phenomena are expressible in terms of material. And\\nsince all material phenomena are expressible in terms of the\\n\\n ― 4 ―\\n                            \\natom and molecule (or whatever names be given to the°ulti-mate\\nultimate forms of matter), therefore all mental are similarly°ex-pressible\\nexpressible. The ultimate form of matter contains, then,°implic-itly\\nimplicitly, all phenomena of mind and society. In short, the coarsest\\nform of matter with which you can begin, as well as the\\nhighest organism with which you end, must contain all\\nemotion, volition, and knowledge, the knowing subject and\\nits relations. Beginning, then, with a strictly monistic°the-ory\\ntheory, and keeping directly in the line of materialistic°reason-ing\\nreasoning, we have ended with the conclusion that the ultimate\\nform of matter has dualistic \"mind\" and \"matter\"°prop-erties\\nproperties. Nor is there any escape from this conclusion on a\\nmaterialistic basis. Therefore on its physical or constructive\\nside we find such a theory suicidal.\\nTo be sure, a materialist might reply that ultimately\\nthe \"matter\"-molecular-property accounted for and caused\\nthe \"mind\"-molecular-property, but proof, or suggestion of\\nproof, or suggestion as to method of finding proof, all are\\nequally absent. If a materialist were to say that this double-\\nsided substance is what he means by matter, we could only\\nreply that he is playing with words—that it is just as much\\nmind as it is matter.\\nWe have now to consider the strictly metaphysical\\nassumptions of materialism.\\nFirst, it assumes the possibility of ontological°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, by which we mean knowledge of being or substance\\napart from a mere succession of phenomena. The substance\\nwhich is so known is matter. Now, since it is this statement\\nthat a belief in the possibility of ontological knowledge is an\\ninherent necessity in all materialistic reasoning, which is the\\nbasis of our criticism, the statement must be examined more\\nfully. Suppose for the moment that it is not such an inherent\\nnecessity—that it is possible to found materialism on°some-thing\\nsomething besides an ontological basis. If there be no knowledge\\nof substance as such, there is either only knowledge of\\nphenomena produced by the activity of the Ego (pure\\nsubjective idealism), or of phenomena entirely unrelated to\\nany substance whatever (Humian scepticism), or of those\\nrelated only to objective spirit (Berkeleian idealism), or of\\nthose related to an unknown and unknowable substance (H.\\n\\n ― 5 ―\\n                            \\nSpencer), or of those brought into unity by the forms of\\nknowledge which the mind necessarily imposes on all°phe-nomena\\nphenomena given in consciousness (as Kant). Now, since none\\nof these can afford a sufficient basis for a theory, which posits\\nmatter as the universal underlying unity, we must admit\\nthat materialism exists on the basis of a belief in the°possibil-ity\\npossibility of ontological knowledge of such objective reality. If a\\nmaterialist, who still believes that we have no knowledge of\\nsubstance as such, replies that while we have knowledge of\\nphenomena only, yet we know them as the effects of matter,\\nthe answer is obvious. Either we know this substance,°mat-ter\\nmatter, which is the cause of them, or we do not. If we do, it is\\nontological knowledge. If we do not, then it is as much\\nassumption to claim that it is matter as it would be to name\\nit mind. We must conclude, therefore, that a knowledge\\ntranscending phenomena is the sole thinkable basis for°mate-rialism\\nmaterialism.\\nStarting from this, we have to consider the relation of\\nsuch knowledge to materialism. What is involved in°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of matter as substance?\\nTo know, requires something which knows. To know\\nmaterial phenomena, are required mental phenomena. A\\nthing is for the mind non-existent until it is an idea or\\nphenomenon of the mind. To know substance, matter, is\\nrequired substance, mind. If materialism merely posited\\nknowledge of material phenomena, there would be required\\nto give it validity only mental phenomena, which do, on\\nevery theory, exist. A theory, however, which posits°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of a substance besides, must also posit something more\\nthan phenomena in order to know this substance. If there be\\nno substance, mind, then there are only series of mental\\nstates or successions of mental phenomena. But it is a mere\\ntruism to say that phenomena cannot go beyond phenomena.\\nSuccessions of consciousnesses irrelated, or related only in\\ntime, can but give knowledge of phenomena similarly°re-lated\\nrelated. Undoubtedly the former may be but subjective, while\\nthe latter are objective, but that does not constitute°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of substance. To have real knowledge of real being,\\nthere must be something which abides through the°succes-sive\\nsuccessive states, and which perceives their relations to that being\\n\\n ― 6 ―\\n                            \\nand to itself. To say that the mind, if itself a mere°phenome-non\\nphenomenon or group of phenomena, can transcend phenomena and\\nobtain a knowledge of that reality which accounts both for\\nother phenomena and for itself, is absurd. But there is no\\nneed to multiply words to show what is, after all,°self-evi-dent\\nself-evident—that phenomenal knowledge is phenomenal, and that\\nto transcend phenomena there must be something besides a\\nphenomenon. We find materialism, then, in this position. To\\nprove that mind is a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to\\nassume the possibility of ontological knowledge—i.e., real\\nknowledge of real being; but in that real knowledge is\\nnecessarily involved a subject which knows. To prove that\\nmind is a phenomenon, it is obliged to implicitly assume that\\nit is a substance. Could there be anything more°self-destruc-tive\\nself-destructive?\\nSecondly, it assumes the reality of the causal nexus,\\nand the possibility of knowledge of real causation. In°declar-ing\\ndeclaring that matter causes mind, it declares that the relation is\\none of efficiency and dependency, and not one of succession\\n—antecedent and consequent. For, if it be the latter, then\\nthere are only succession and conjunction of material and\\nmental phenomena, irrelated or related only in time, in\\nwhich case it would be absurd to say that matter caused\\nmind.\\nWe have therefore to consider what is involved in real\\ncausation, and the knowledge of it as such, and what°rela-tion\\nrelation the involved facts bear to the theory of materialism.\\nHow, on a materialistic hypothesis, can the knowledge\\nof a real causal nexus be obtained? It cannot be a primary,\\nnecessary intuition of the human mind, nor yet a universal\\nmode of viewing things, for both of these imply the reality of\\nsubstantial mind. Nor can it be a concept obtained from\\nexperience, and generalized by unconscious habit. For, in\\nthe first place, such a concept is necessarily subjective, and\\nbelongs only to the mind which framed it. It may or may not\\nobtain as an objective relation among objective things.\\nThere is no ground for positing objective validity of any\\nmental conception, except by a priori mind necessity, which\\na materialistic theory must reject. But, secondly, and\\nchiefly, such a theory as to the origin of a knowledge of the\\n\\n ― 7 ―\\n                            \\ncausal nexus contains a petitio principii—i.e., it presupposes\\nreal causation to account for our knowledge of real°causa-tion\\ncausation. For this generalized belief, being a result of experience,\\nis itself an effect of the phenomena given in experience. To\\nensure, therefore, that it is a true concept—i.e., one holding\\ngood objectively—we must assume that it was produced by a\\ntrue causal nexus, which in turn is the thing to be accounted\\nfor. It certainly is begging the question to say that our\\nknowledge that causation is real is a result of experience,\\nwhen to prove that experience can produce a correct result\\nwe have to assume that very reality of causation which is to\\nbe proved. Nothing can be more illogical than to deduce\\nknowledge of real causation from that which has for its own\\nbasis that same reality. After accounting for the one, the\\nother still remains to be accounted for, which can be done\\nonly by reasoning in a circle. There is yet available one\\nresource to materialism—to claim that, although our°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of true causation is not generalized from a series of\\nexperiences, it is obtained directly from the knowledge of\\nphenomena—that in any two or more phenomena there is\\nalso given the causal nexus and the knowledge of it. Now,\\nwe might object to this, that it approached the position of\\nthe strictest intuitionalist, and that, as mere phenomena,\\nthere is in them nothing but the relation of co-existence and\\nsuccession. Objective phenomena are not labelled \"this is\\nthe cause of that\"; and, therefore, if the mind thinks it finds\\nin them such a relation, that relation must be brought to the\\nphenomena by the mind itself. Or we might also say that, if\\na series of experiences is incompetent (as we have seen it is)\\nto give a knowledge of causation, on a materialistic°hypothe-sis\\nhypothesis, a fortiori, a single experience is. But waiving these, we\\nhave to see what is contained in this theory, granting the\\ntruth of materialism. According to it, the knowledge of these\\nobjects, and that of the causal nexus between them, is the\\nresult of matter, and therefore is a dependent \"effect\"—the\\nfirst effect in the perfect blank, which is to change that\\nblank into what we call mind and its content. (The first,\\nbecause by the theory the knowledge of causation, not being\\nderived from experiences, must be contained in the first two\\nphenomena given in consciousness.) But as an effect it is, of\\n\\n ― 8 ―\\n                            \\ncourse, a phenomenon, and for a phenomenon to transcend\\nphenomena, and attain the reality behind them, is, as before\\nshown, impossible. Ontological knowledge is not possible to\\nthe mind when the mind is considered as a phenomenal\\neffect. Knowledge of causation cannot be reached, then, on a\\nmaterialistic theory, either through experiences or a single\\nexperience without intuitional or ontological knowledge.\\nOnly one way remains—that it should be reached through\\nthe activity of the Ego itself. The mind is a true cause, and\\ngives knowledge of true causation. So, to prove mind and\\neffect, materialism would have to postulate it as a cause. It is\\nagain suicidal.\\nTo sum up: To prove a strict monism, materialism has\\nto assume an original irresolvable dualism. To prove the\\nmind a phenomenon of matter, it is obliged to assume a\\nsubstance to give knowledge of that matter. To prove that it\\nis an effect of matter, it is obliged to assume either an\\nintuitional power of mind, or that mind is itself a cause, both\\nequally destructive of materialism.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that as a philosophical theory\\nmaterialism has proved itself a complete felo-de-se. To°af-ford\\nafford itself a thinkable basis, it assumes things which°thor-oughly\\nthoroughly destroy the theory.\\n\\n ― 9 ―\\n                            \\nThe Pantheism of Spinoza [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVI\\n(July 1882), 249-57. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe problem of philosophy is to determine the meaning of\\nthings as we find them, or of the actual. Since these things\\nmay be gathered under three heads, the problem becomes:\\nto determine the meaning of Thought, Nature, and God,\\nand the relations of one to another. The first stage of\\nthought being Dogmatism, the first philosophy will be that\\nof the common uneducated mind-Natural Realism. God,\\nself, and the world are three independent realities, and the\\nmeaning of each is just what it seems to be. If, however,\\nthey are independent realities, how can they relate to each\\nother? This question gives rise to the second stage of°Dog-matic\\nDogmatic Philosophy, which, according to the mind of the\\nholder, takes either the direction of Dogmatic Idealism or a\\nDualism with God as the Deus ex Machina, like that of\\nDescartes. The reconciliation of the elements here involved\\nleads to the third stage, where God becomes the Absolute,\\nand Nature and Self are but his manifestations. This is\\nPantheism, and the view-point of Spinoza. Thought and\\nbeing become one; the order of thought is the order of\\nexistence. Now a final unity seems obtained, and real°knowl-edge\\nknowledge possible.\\nThe problem of philosophy being to determine the\\nmeaning of the Actual, its final test must be the°complete-ness\\ncompleteness with which its answer agrees with and accounts for the\\nActual. By this we do not mean, of course, that its°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation must agree with the common interpretation. There is\\ncertainly no shadow of reason for supposing that the°meta-physic\\nmetaphysic of the uneducated mind is the final one to which all\\nmetaphysic must conform. But every philosophy must°an-swer\\n ― 10 ―\\n                            \\nanswer this question: Does it provide the factors which in their\\ndevelopment account for the Actual as it is interpreted by\\nthat theory, and for other interpretations also? In short, it\\nmust account not only for things as they are, but also as they\\nseem to be. To stop at the first point is simply to beg the\\nquestion. The best answer to any question is the one which\\nenables you to understand and to account for all other°possi-ble\\npossible answers.\\nHas Spinoza done this? It must be confessed that to\\nmany minds he seems to have done so. That we may attempt\\nto see whether he has or not, let us state the problem again.\\nIt is to reconcile the Infinite, and the apparent finite, by the\\nhypothesis of the Infinite alone; to show the unity between\\nthe Absolute and the seeming relative by the hypothesis of\\nthe Absolute alone. A hard task; but in reading the Ethics of\\nSpinoza, we seem to find it accomplished, and the two°ele-ments\\nelements, side by side, deduced from a common principle. To\\naid the mind to determine whether this accomplishment is\\nonly seeming, or is real, is our object now.\\nWe shall endeavor to show that the solution of the\\nproblem by Spinoza, the reconciliation of the two elements,\\nis brought about only by the assumption of contradictory\\nelements in his premises, and the surreptitious bringing in\\nof new ones as he proceeds. As we begin, we can do so with\\nno better thought than that of Kant. A system which°pro-ceeds\\nproceeds geometrically, like Spinoza\\'s, must either draw°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic or analytic conclusions, the analytic being conclusions\\nwhich simply unfold what was already contained in the\\ngiven conceptions, the synthetic being those which go°be-yond\\nbeyond the given ones and add something to them. If the\\nformer, then, unless you would beg the whole question, you\\nmust show the validity and reality of your definitions; if the\\nlatter, you must show whence you obtain your material for\\ngoing outside of the given conceptions. We shall endeavor to\\nshow the existence of contradictory elements in Spinoza\\'s\\npremises, not by a direct examination of them, but indirectly\\nby drawing from them conclusions in plainest contradiction\\nto those which he draws.\\nThe object of the First Part of Spinoza\\'s Ethics, \"De\\nDeo,\" is to demonstrate the existence of one substance°infi-nite\\n ― 11 ―\\n                            \\ninfinite in infinite attributes, and to show the relation of this\\nsubstance to finite things-viz., that they are but its°acci-dents\\naccidents. That our exposition may be as clear as possible, we\\nshall for the occasion adopt Spinoza\\'s method, and, taking\\nhis axioms and definitions as our premises, draw conclusions\\nfrom them in geometrical form. To distinguish, our°proposi-tions\\npropositions will be designated by Arabic, and Spinoza\\'s by Roman\\nnumerals.\\nDefinit. I. By that which is the cause of itself I°under-stand\\nunderstand that whose essence involves existence, or that whose\\nnature can only be conceived as existent.\\nII. That thing is said to be finite in its kind which can\\nbe limited by another of the same nature.\\nIII. By substance I understand that which is in itself,\\nand is conceived through itself—i.e., whose conception does\\nnot need any other conception by which it must be formed.\\nIV. By attribute I understand that which the mind\\nperceives, in substance, as constituting its essence.\\nV. By mode I understand the accidents of substance,\\nor that which is in something else, by means of which also it\\nis conceived.\\nVI.

That is called free which exists by the sole°neces-sity\\nnecessity of its own nature, and is determined to action by itself\\nalone.\\nVIII.

An attribute is that which the intellect perceives\\nto constitute the essence of substance (Def. 4), and hence\\nmust be conceived through itself (Def. 3), which was the\\nfirst point; and through itself alone; for if an attribute could\\nbe conceived through something else, since it constitutes the\\nessence of substance, a substance could be also thus°con-ceived\\nconceived, which is absurd (Def. 3).

For nothing exists but\\nattributes (Cor. 1, Prop. 3), and they are all infinite.\\nScholium. It will now be immediately seen that we\\nhave arrived at a denial of one of Spinoza\\'s fundamental\\nconclusions-viz., the existence of finite things as modes or\\naccidents of God. It has not been sufficiently pointed out, I\\nthink, how surreptitiously Spinoza introduces this°concep-tion\\nconception. It will be found in Prop. XXVIII, where he states that\\nany particular thing which is finite, and has a determined\\nexistence, cannot exist or be determined to action except it\\nbe so determined by another finite object similarly°deter-mined\\ndetermined, and so on infinitely. But it will be noticed that this is\\na conditional judgment, stating only that if there are finite\\nthings, they are so determined. But the very question is: are\\nthere such finite objects? and Spinoza only assumes that. He\\nhas made his synthetic judgment only by smuggling in one\\nof the very things to be accounted for. The question as to\\nhow finite objects are determined possesses no relevancy or\\nvalidity until it is shown that finite objects can exist at all.\\nBut Spinoza proceeds as if his conditional judgment°pos-sessed\\npossessed validity not only in its conclusion, but also with\\nregard to its predicate—the existence of finite things. In\\nshort, he begs the whole question, and the greater part of his\\nsecond book rests ultimately on this petitio. An examination\\nof the demonstration of this 28th Prop. will show what\\nconclusion Spinoza ought to have arrived at regarding the\\nexistence of the predicate of his major premise. He first\\nshows, by reference to previous propositions, that whatever\\nhas been determined has been so determined by God, and\\nthat a finite thing cannot be produced from the absolute\\nnature of any attribute of God, nor from any attribute°modi-fied\\nmodified with a modification which is eternal and infinite. Hence,\\nhe concludes, it must be produced by some modification\\nwhich is finite. In other words, the condition of a finite thing\\nis a finite thing, and so regressively in an infinite series. In\\nother words, again, the existence of finite things is not\\naccounted for at all; it is only assumed. The conclusion he\\n\\n ― 14 ―\\n                            \\nshould have drawn is the following: A finite thing, if it\\nexist, must depend upon another finite, and so on forever.\\nHence God, since he is infinite, could never cause a finite\\nthing; but since he is the cause of everything, no finite thing\\ncould be caused at all, or have existence. Hence the°hypothe-sis\\nhypothesis is false. That Spinoza did not see that this was the only\\nconclusion to be logically drawn from his arguments, shows\\nhow completely his mind was preoccupied with the realistic\\nassumptions which he had unconsciously derived from°pre-vious\\nprevious systems. In a similar way we may demonstrate that the\\nhypothesis regarding determination to action or change\\nmust be false if we admit the previous conclusions. For they\\nshow that no attribute can change, or produce change, since\\nit is eternal and immutable (Cor. 2, Prop. xx). And if a\\nmode can change, the change must depend upon a change in\\nsome other mode, and so on in an infinite regression. That\\nis, God could not produce the first change, which is absurd.\\nTherefore, the hypothesis of change is absurd.\\nProp. 5. One attribute cannot be produced by another.\\nDem. For since they have nothing in common (Cor. 3,\\nProp. 3) they cannot be conceived through each other (Ax.\\n5), and, accordingly, one cannot be the cause of another\\n(Ax. 4). Q.E.D.\\nProp. 6. It belongs to the nature of attributes to exist.\\nFor since one cannot be the cause of another°(preced-ing\\n(preceding Prop.), it must be its own cause—i.e. (Def. 1), it\\nbelongs to its nature to exist.\\nCor. Attributes are eternal (preceding Prop. and Def.\\n8).\\nProp. 7. An infinite number of attributes exist.\\nDem. If you deny it, imagine, if you can, that there is\\nnot an infinite number. Then the essence of each will not\\ninclude existence, which is absurd (Prop. 6). Therefore, the\\nhypothesis is absurd, and an infinite number, etc.\\nScholium. The reader will observe that this is precisely\\nthe argument of Spinoza in Prop. XXI regarding the°exist-ence\\nexistence of God.\\nProp. 8. An infinite number of substances exist.\\nDem. Proved like the previous proposition, or\\nAliter. Since an infinite number of attributes exist,\\n\\n ― 15 ―\\n                            \\neach of which constitutes the essence of substance (Def. 4),\\nan infinite number of substances must exist.\\nCor. God, or one substance with an infinite number of\\nattributes, does not exist.\\nScholium. The reader who may have been prepared for\\nthe demonstration that the existence of finite things was\\ncontradictory to the remainder of Spinoza\\'s philosophy, will\\nperhaps be surprised to see this denial of God\\'s existence,\\nand think that it may depend upon some trickery of words,\\nand not be logically involved in Spinoza\\'s premises. But that\\nit is, may be shown, I think. In Prop. XI, where he attempts\\nto prove the existence of only one substance of infinite°attri-butes\\nattributes, he really proves only the existence of an infinite°num-ber\\nnumber of substances, or of an infinite number of attributes. The\\nsubsumption of these latter under unity is entirely°unjusti-fied\\nunjustified by anything in the proposition. In scholium of Prop. X\\nhe seems to realize the difficulty of having an infinity of\\nattributes belonging to one and the same substance, but\\nattempts to escape from it by saying that nothing could be\\nclearer than that the more reality or being anything has, the\\nmore attributes it must have, and hence a being absolutely\\ninfinite must have an infinity of attributes. This would be\\ntrue if he had before proved that for substance, as he defines\\nit, to have such a number was possible, or implied no°contra-diction\\ncontradiction. But he has not done this, and it may be shown in the\\nfollowing that he cannot. An attribute is that which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes the essence of substance. Hence, if there are two or\\nmore attributes (a fortiori, if an infinity) in the same°sub-stance\\nsubstance, they must either constitute different essences, which\\nis absurd, or the same essence, in which case they will be one\\nand the same attribute. Two things only are possible to\\nSpinoza. He may have either an infinite number of attributes\\nexisting in entire independence of each other, hence°consti-tuting\\nconstituting an infinite number of substances; or one infinite°sub-stance\\nsubstance, with one infinite attribute. But to unite the two°con-ceptions\\nconceptions involves contradiction, as before shown. Yet this is\\nwhat he does practically, using either, as the exigencies of\\nthe case require.\\nWe now see Spinoza as a magician, supplied with his\\nconjuring material. With two infinites—one the very°nega-tion\\n ― 16 ―\\n                            \\nnegation of the finite, the other existing only in relation to the\\nfinite; with two substances—one with a number of attributes,\\nthe other with but one—he can proceed by dexterous°substi-tutions\\nsubstitutions to produce any required results before our astonished\\neyes.\\nThis concludes our examination of Part First. We hope\\nthat our original statement regarding the existence of°con-tradictions\\ncontradictions in the premises, and the introduction of new\\nconceptions from without, will be seen to be justified. The\\ncontradiction is now seen to be this: In definitions three and\\nfour a substance is posited which can be conceived only,\\nand, consequently, can exist only in itself, constituted by\\nattributes necessarily existing in the same manner. But in\\nthe fifth we have the idea of something which can exist in\\nsomething else. If the third and fourth are accepted, this\\nlatter must be necessarily denied, unless we hold that there\\nexists something besides substance and mode, which is°con-tradictory\\ncontradictory to the first and second axioms. The similar°contra-diction\\ncontradiction between the two former and the sixth has been\\nsufficiently brought out in the scholium to our last°proposi-tion\\nproposition.\\nIt would not be much better than a waste of time to\\nfollow Spinoza through his other Parts and show that in\\nevery case his apparent reconciliation of the finite and the\\ninfinite is brought about either by the introduction of the\\nthing to be accounted for, or that it is contradictory to some\\nother part of his system, or both. The clew is now in the\\npossession of the reader, and any one who wishes to, may\\ndevelop it at length.\\nWe wish, however, to simply direct attention to a few\\npoints in Part Second, \"De Mente.\" Axiom fifth of this\\nbook, upon which he relies for his proof that the object of\\nthe idea which constitutes the real existence of the human\\nmind is the body (see Prop. XIII, Pt. 2), declares that we\\nneither feel, nor perceive, any particular objects except°bod-ies\\nbodies and modes of thought. But Prop. XVI, Pt. 1, declares that\\ninfinite things in infinite modes must exist, from each of\\nwhich (Prop. XXXVI, Pt. 1) some effect must necessarily\\nfollow, which effect must involve the knowledge of its cause\\n(Ax. 4, Pt. 1). Again, as the first book attempted to explain\\n\\n ― 17 ―\\n                            \\nfinite things as accidents of substance, so the second°at-tempts\\nattempts to explain error as nothing positive, but simply°inad-equacy\\ninadequacy or privation. To do this he is obliged to assume three\\nkinds of Gods. First, God in so far as he is infinite (Prop. XI,\\nCor.: quatenus infinitus est), in so far as he constitutes the\\nessence of the human mind (ibid.: quatenus humanæ Mentis\\nessentiam constituit), and in so far as he is considered as\\naffected with the idea of a particular object actually existing\\n(Prop. IX, quatenus rei singularis actu existentis idea°affec-tus\\naffectus consideratur). It is needless to say that these different\\nnotions are either meaningless or else contradictory to each\\nother, and brought in as the exigencies of the case happen to\\nrequire one rather than the other. But the reader can easily\\ndemonstrate for himself, that error, even in the sense of\\nprivation or inadequate knowledge, is impossible by using\\nthe propositions of the first book. Another contradiction may\\nbe shown as follows: In the scholium to Prop. XV he shows\\nthat matter can be regarded as divisible, or composed of\\nparts, only in so far as it relates to the imagination; but in\\nthe second book, when he comes to account for the°imagina-tion\\nimagination, he is obliged to assume these same parts for an°ade-quate\\nadequate explanation (see the Postulates, and Props. XV, XVI,\\nXVII, with Cor. and scholium, of Pt. 2).\\nIn truth, Spinoza is a juggler who keeps in stock two\\nGods—one the perfect infinite and absolute being, the other\\nthe mere sum of the universe with all its defects as they\\nappear to us. When he wishes to show God as the adequate\\ncause of all, to explain truth, inculcate morality, his°legerde-main\\nlegerdemain brings the First before us; when finite things, change,\\nerror, etc., are to be accounted for, his Second appears—the\\nGod who does things not in so far as he is Infinite, and who\\nis affected with the idea of finite things.\\nWe might have known, a priori, that such°contradic-tions\\ncontradictions must occur in a pantheistic system like Spinoza\\'s. It\\nrests upon the basis that the only real knowledge is°immedi-ate\\nimmediate knowledge. In this case the Absolute becomes mere\\nBeing, an Abstract Universal, possessed with no°determina-tions\\ndeterminations whatever, for determinations are negations. Such,\\nwhen Spinoza is truly logical, is his God. But, in this case,\\nhe cannot account for particular concrete objects. The two\\n\\n ― 18 ―\\n                            \\nelements are necessarily irreconcilable from such a stand-\\npoint as Spinoza\\'s regarding knowledge.\\nTwo logical pantheistic systems are possible. One must\\nstart with the conception of an Absolute Perfect Being in\\nwhom are all things, but this theory cannot account for\\nthings as we find them. It must deny that they are what they\\nseem to be, and elevate them into the Divine. But the rock on\\nwhich every such theory must split is the problem: If, then,\\nall things are divine, how, then, do they appear to us°other-wise\\notherwise? Here is where Spinoza failed. The other theory must\\nstart from the conception of things as they seem to be, and\\nproduce its Pantheism, not by elevating them into God, but\\nby bringing God down to them. Such a theory, of course,\\ncan never arrive at the conception of the Absolute, the\\nPerfect, and the Infinite. Strictly speaking, it is not°Panthe-ism\\nPantheism at all; it is Pancosmism. But this is not a solution; it is\\nmerely an assumption of all that is to be explained.\\n\\n ― 19 ―\\n                            \\nKnowledge and the Relativity of Feeling [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVII\\n(Jan. 1883), 56-70. Not reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nThe doctrine of the Relativity of Knowledge is one of the\\nmost characteristic theories of modern thought. To many,\\nindeed, it seems the sum of all modern wisdom. That we\\ncannot know Being, but must confine ourselves to sequences\\namong phenomena—this appears to many the greatest\\nachievement of thought: a discovery whose full meaning it\\nwas reserved for the Nineteenth Century to penetrate, and\\none which, if mastered, will put an end to all the idle\\nspeculation which is supposed to have disgraced the°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical thought of the past, and turn intellectual activity\\ninto the fruitful fields of real knowledge.\\nThe doctrine has been reached in at least four different\\nways, and held by as many schools. There is the Positivist,\\nwho claims to have reached the doctrine as the result of\\nhistory, and not from any system of Metaphysics, and who is\\namong the loudest in proclaiming it the panacea for all ills\\nwhich intellect is heir to. There is the school who profess to\\nhave reached it from a philosophical examination of thought\\nitself, and to have found it involved in \"imbecilities\" at\\nevery attempt to overstep phenomena-the school whose\\nchief representative is Hamilton, but more lately given to\\ncalling up the greater shade of Kant to conjure by. Then\\nthere is the Associationalist, who, after Hume had made\\nwreck of Sensationalism by showing that its methods and\\npresuppositions left no basis for any objective knowledge—\\nno, nor for objective existence either-had before him the\\nsorry task of keeping the method and yet avoiding the result.\\n\\n ― 20 ―\\n                            \\nHis instrument was the \"association of ideas,\" and by it he\\nattempted to reach results compatible with every-day\\nthought and the established facts of physical science. But to\\nwhatever extent he succeeded (and we are not concerned\\nwith that question at present), he found himself confined\\nwithin the limits of his subjective capacity for association,\\nand he, too, took Relativity for his shibboleth.\\nBut with the development of the theory of evolution\\narose a school that wielded a mightier weapon. Here was an\\nestablished scientific theory which assumed objective°exist-ence\\nexistence, and also, in one of its highest generalizations, included\\nman, and showed that he, and presumably his intellect and\\nknowledge, had in the progress of the cycles been developed\\nfrom these original existences and forces. Here, then, is a\\ntheory which, in a certain form, may deny all creating and\\nconstructive thought, and consequently be thoroughly°sensa-tionalistic\\nsensationalistic. Furthermore, by extending indefinitely the\\nsphere and time of operations, it bridged the gaps and\\nstrengthened the weak points of former sensationalism; and,\\nabove all, it postulated objective existence. Here, then, is a\\ntheory which may satisfy the demands of physical science\\nand of \"common-sense\" as to existence independent of\\nsubjective feeling; pay a compliment to the former by°adopt-ing\\nadopting its methods and results, and at the same time forever\\nsilence all who claim that we have absolute knowledge. For,\\nnotice how this theory is also compelled to assume the form\\nof Relativity. According to it, in the form we are°consider-ing\\nconsidering, all knowledge is, through a nervous organism,°con-structed\\nconstructed through evolution from the lowest form of life, or\\nfrom matter. Accordingly, it must be conditioned by the\\nstate and quality of the organism, and cannot represent or\\ncopy objective existence. It is therefore relative to the°sub-ject\\nsubject. But since, according to the realistic assumptions of the\\ntheory, there is objective existence, this must remain forever\\nunknown and unknowable. To know it would be possible\\nonly through the contradiction of a feeling not relative to the\\nsubject. This, then, is the position of that form of the°doc-trine\\ndoctrine of the Relativity of Knowledge which is probably most\\nwidely influential at present. All knowledge is derived from\\nfeeling; feeling is conditioned upon the existence of external\\n\\n ― 21 ―\\n                            \\nobjects, and expresses the way in which the sentient subject\\nis affected by them, and not what they are in themselves. All\\nknowledge is through feeling, and all feeling is relative.\\nSuch are its dogmas.\\nWhat we intend in this paper is to examine into the\\ntheory of the Relativity of Knowledge in so far as it bases\\nitself upon the fact of the relativity of feeling to a subject.\\nWere we to examine it exhaustively in its relations to the\\ntheory of evolution, with which in its fourth form it is\\nconnected, it would be necessary to ask how the scientific\\ntheory of evolution, by hypothesis an exact and correct°state-ment\\nstatement of a universal law, is compatible with any such°sup-posed\\nsupposed origin of knowledge. But we pass over this for the\\npresent, and will inquire simply into the mutual relations of\\nthe two parts of any sensationalistic theory of the relativity\\nof knowledge.\\nThat we may have the work thoroughly before us, it\\nmust be noticed, first, that Relative here signifies subjective\\nas opposed to objective, phenomenal as opposed to°ontologi-cal\\nontological. It denotes an imperfection of thought, not its essence.\\nSecondly, this theory in its present form is not a°psychologi-cal\\npsychological theory. It does not simply state certain facts regarding\\nthe method in which we get to know the world, but claims to\\nbe a Philosophy, and so gives epistemological conclusions\\nregarding the knowableness of Being, and, therefore,°onto-logical\\nontological conclusions regarding the nature of Being, viz., that\\nit is unrelated to Thought.\\nPlausible as the theory seems at first sight, by reason\\nof its supposed basis in well-established scientific facts, it is\\nimpossible, upon further reflection, to suppress certain°ques-tionings\\nquestionings. These formulate themselves as follows: How is it\\npossible to assume at the same time the truth of the°sensa-tionalist\\nsensationalist hypothesis and that of the Relativity of Feeling?\\nAre these two doctrines ultimately reconcilable? Does not\\nthe possibility of knowing the relativity of our feelings imply\\nan element in knowledge besides these feelings? Could a\\nmerely feeling consciousness ever arrive at the knowledge\\nthat there were objects as referred to which its feelings were\\npurely relative? In a word: Can a consciousness made up\\nexclusively of feelings which are ex hypothesi relative ever\\n\\n ― 22 ―\\n                            \\ntranscend this relativity, and make assertions regarding an\\nabsolute object as referred to which alone they could be\\ntermed relative?\\nWhat I wish to present is some suggestions in answer\\nof this question; and incidentally, if possible, to throw some\\nlight upon the ultimate ontological bearings of any theory of\\nthe relativity of feeling.\\nIt is to be noticed, first, that this theory assumes that\\nthere is an absolute object or objects. There can be no\\nrelative except as referred to an Absolute. It is only by\\nassuming that there is something Non-relative that we can\\nknow our feelings to be relative. Relative and absolute are\\ncorrelate terms, and one without the other is meaningless, or\\nrather impossible. Were it not postulated that there is a\\nNon-relative existence as referred to which our present°ac-tual\\nactual feelings are relative, it is evident that the feelings°them-selves\\nthemselves would be the ultimate and absolute, thus°contradict-ing\\ncontradicting the hypothesis. There is no need to occupy space in\\nstating these truisms, for, besides their self-evident°charac-ter\\ncharacter, they are admitted, or rather claimed, by the chief°mod-ern\\nmodern representative of the doctrine we are examining. Says\\nMr. Spencer: \"The proposition, that whatever we feel has\\nan existence which is relative to ourselves only, cannot be\\nproved, nay, cannot even be intelligibly expressed, without\\nasserting directly, or by implication, an external existence\\nwhich is not relative to ourselves. . . .\" The hypothesis\\n\"that the active antecedents of each primary feeling exist\\nindependently of consciousness is the only thinkable one. It\\nis the one implicitly asserted in the very proposition that\\nfeelings are relative to our own nature, and it is taken for\\ngranted in every step of every argument by which the°propo-sition\\nproposition is proved\" (Spencer, Principles of Psychology, vol. i,\\npp. 208, 209). And, again: \"More certain than the relativity\\nof relations, as we conceive them, is the existence of°non-rel-ative\\nnon-relative forms to which they refer; since proof of the first\\ninvolves perpetual assumption of the last\" (Spencer, p.\\n227).\\nIt being admitted, then, that knowledge of the°relativ-ity\\nrelativity of feeling implies knowledge of a non-relative existence,\\nthe question arises as to the compatibility of this position\\n\\n ― 23 ―\\n                            \\nwith the theory it accompanies, viz., that all knowledge is\\nderived from feeling. Is it logically possible to hold that all\\nknowledge comes from feeling, and yet that there is°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of the existence of an Absolute? Rather, does not one\\nposition exclude the other? We will put the case in its\\nsimplest form. Either there is knowledge of something\\nNon-relative or there is not. If the latter be the case, then, as\\nwe have already seen, the relativity of feeling could never be\\nknown, nay, the question as to its relativity could never have\\noccurred to consciousness. The former alternative is the one\\nadopted. We must admit that there is knowledge of the\\nexistence of an absolute object. But how is this knowledge\\nobtained? Since all knowledge comes from feeling, this must\\nalso. In other words, since sensation-knowledge we must\\nhave sensation that there is an absolute existence. But on\\nthis theory (that every feeling is relative) an absolute°sensa-tion\\nsensation is a contradiction in terms. We may give up the°sensa-tionalist\\nsensationalist hypothesis, and, admitting that we have knowledge\\nnot derived from feeling (viz., that an Absolute exists), hold\\nthat feeling is relative. Or we may give up the Relativity\\ntheory and hold, so far at least as this point is concerned,\\nthat Sensationalism is true. But to attempt to hold them\\ntogether is suicidal. If all our knowledge comes from°feel-ing\\nfeeling, since we can never have a feeling of the absolute object,\\nwe never can have knowledge of it; and we cannot have a\\nfeeling of it, since, by the theory, the Absolute is precisely\\nthat which is not conditioned by feeling. Or, on the other\\nhand, if we know that all feeling is relative, we do know that\\nthere is an absolute object, and hence have knowledge not\\nderived from sensation. When these alternatives are once\\nfairly faced, it will be seen that one or the other must be\\ndefinitely adopted. Both cannot be accepted. To attempt it is\\nto show that neither position is understood.\\nSuch is the fact. The reason for it is not far to seek. By\\nthe sensationalist hypothesis, we know only our feelings;\\naccording to the Relativity theory, we must know the°rela-tion\\nrelation of our feelings to an object; this the feelings cannot\\ngive, except by transcending their relativity—except, in\\nshort, by ceasing to be feelings. Hume showed once for all\\nthat if the sensationalist presuppositions be adopted, the\\n\\n ― 24 ―\\n                            \\n\"perceptions\" themselves were ultimate and final, and that\\nany supposed reference of them to an object is a fiction to be\\naccounted for as best may be.\\nAn examination of the method by which Mr. Spencer\\nattempts to unite with his sensationalism the position that\\nthe existence of an Absolute is known will confirm us in the\\nconclusions just drawn, for we shall see that the best which\\nhe can offer is a virtual surrender. His argument was°sub-stantially\\nsubstantially given in the passages cited from him, and is°simi-lar\\nsimilar to that given in the First Principles for the existence of\\nan absolute object in general. Briefly, it is as follows: \"The\\nexistence of a Non-relative is unavoidably asserted in every\\nchain of reasoning by which relativity is proved.\" This is\\napparently offered as a serious argument in proof of the\\nexistence of an absolute object; at least it is all that is\\noffered. Its worth may be made evident by a parallel°exam-ple\\nexample. To prove A, we must assume B; by its assumption A is\\nproved. But B is involved in the proof of A; therefore B is\\nalso proved. It is evident, or ought to be, that we have here\\nno proof of the existence of either A or B, of the Relative or\\nNon-relative, but simply that there can be no A without B,\\nno Relative without an Absolute—an undoubted fact, but\\none which leaves the existence of either in as much doubt as\\nbefore. In truth, it is not a solution of the difficulty, but a\\nstatement of it. It says that unless there be an absolute\\nobject, our feelings cannot be known as relative; while the\\nquestion is precisely how is this absolute object known. Mr.\\nSpencer\\'s legitimate conclusions from his argument are°ei-ther\\neither that there is no absolute object, and hence the feelings\\nare not relative, or we do know they are relative, and hence\\nknow that there is an absolute object, and have knowledge\\nwhich is not relative. To attempt, as he does, to prove the\\nexistence of one from the assumed existence of the other is to\\nreason in a circle. It cannot be that we know there is a\\nNon-relative because we know that our feelings are relative,\\nfor the latter point is just the one in question, and cannot be\\nproved, as Mr. Spencer himself shows, without assumption\\nof the former. The knowledge of the existence of the°Rela-tive\\nRelative cannot be made to depend upon the assumption of a\\nNon-relative, and knowledge of the existence of the°Non-rel-ative\\n ― 25 ―\\n                            \\nNon-relative upon that of the Relative, at one and the same time.\\nBut it is only by this most illogical procedure that Mr.\\nSpencer gets the Absolute, which, as he recognizes, is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to the proof of the Relativity hypothesis.\\nWe conclude, then, that we are justified in reasserting\\nour original statement. To know that our sensations are\\nrelative, we must know that there is an Absolute. To know\\nthat there is an Absolute is, on the sensationalist hypothesis,\\nto assert the contradictio in adjecto of an absolute feeling, or\\nelse to reason in the wholly illegitimate manner just°exam-ined\\nexamined. Hence, the two positions of Sensationalism and°Rela-tivity\\nRelativity of sensations are wholly irreconcilable.\\nSo far we have confined ourselves to the simplest°as-sumption\\nassumption of these theories as conjoined-the assumption that\\nthere is an absolute object or objects. We have not°con-cerned\\nconcerned ourselves with the question, What is this absolute\\nobject? This, however, can no longer be kept in the°back-ground\\nbackground. Even admitting what we have seen it impossible to\\nadmit on the hypothesis that we have knowledge of the\\nexistence of a Non-relative, we have yet to decide whether\\nthe relativity of feeling can be proved without knowing what\\nthis Non-relative is. The Sensationalist must hold, of course,\\nthat it can be. To hold that sensations can tell us what an\\nabsolute existence is, is a contradiction even greater (if\\nthere be degrees in contradiction) than the one we have just\\nseen the theory involved in. And so we find that the absolute\\nobject is for Mr. Spencer beyond consciousness, independent\\nof consciousness, unknowable. In fact, Absolute and°non-rel-ativeness\\nnon-relativeness to consciousness are synonymous terms with him\\nand the Sensationalists generally. Our question, therefore,\\nis: Can we prove the relativity of feelings on the hypothesis\\nthat they are relative to an unknown something by reference\\nof them to something out of and independent of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness?\\nIn reply, we ask the following questions: 1. Is it°possi-ble\\npossible to know that something is, if we have absolutely no\\nknowledge what that something is? Can we know that an\\nAbsolute is, if we don\\'t know what Absolute means? 2. Is it\\npossible to know the existence of anything which is ex\\nhypothesi out of relation to consciousness, and, further,\\n\\n ― 26 ―\\n                            \\nknow that this is the Absolute? 3. Is it possible to refer the\\nwhole content of consciousness to something which is°be-yond\\nbeyond consciousness? Since the Relative is so only as referred\\nto an Absolute, can such a ratio between that which is in\\nconsciousness and that which is out of it be discovered as to\\ndemonstrate the relative character of the former? All these\\nquestions must, I conceive, be answered in the negative. As\\nto the first, the predication of existence of an Unknowable\\nseems to be a psychological impossibility. If there be any\\nmeaning in the assertion that x is, I confess I cannot see it.\\nWhen it is said that something is, it is meant that something\\nis. The predication must be of something; it cannot be of a\\npure Non-entity, like the Unknowable. The subject must\\nmean something before it can be said either to be or not to\\nbe, or have any other intelligible proposition regarding it\\nmade. And so, as matter of fact, it is only as Mr. Spencer\\nidentifies his Unknowable with an Absolute, and thus takes\\nadvantage of the popular connotations of the word, that he is\\nable to say that the Unknowable is; it is only as he smuggles\\nsome degree of qualification, however slight, into the subject\\nthat he can make it the subject of a proposition.\\nThe question as to the possibility of knowledge of\\nanything beyond consciousness, while presenting, since°un-knowable\\nunknowable, the same difficulties to an affirmative answer as\\nthe question just considered, must, in addition, be answered\\nnegatively, on grounds of self-consistency. To say that°some-thing\\nsomething beyond consciousness is known to exist, is merely to\\nsay that the same thing is and is not in consciousness. Its\\nspecial characteristic is to be out of consciousness; but, so\\nfar as it is known to exist, it is in and for consciousness. To\\nsuppose otherwise is to suppose that consciousness can in\\nsome way get outside of or \"beyond\" itself, and be conscious\\nof that which is not in consciousness—a proposition as°ab-surd\\nabsurd as that a man can stand on his own shoulders, or\\noutstrip his shadow.\\nIf we go further and give to the Absolute any positive\\nsignification, if it becomes anything more than the blank\\nnegation of all determinate relations, the bare is, which\\nnevertheless is a qualification by thought, we are only°add-ing\\nadding further relations to consciousness; we are only°qualify-ing\\n ― 27 ―\\n                            \\nqualifying it further by thought relations. Can the theory we are\\nexamining avoid such determinations? This brings us to our\\nthird question: Can a mere x, an absolutely unrelated object,\\nafford us any ground for asserting the relativity of specific\\nobjects in consciousness as they actually exist? If the°abso-lute\\nabsolute object is entirely out of relation to consciousness, it\\ncertainly cannot be related to feelings, the supposed content\\nof consciousness. Even were it granted that we could know\\nthe existence of an unknowable object and know that it was\\nabsolute, we should not be justified in saying that our actual\\nfeelings were relative; to effect this, the Absolute must be\\nbrought into specific relations with specific feelings. As long\\nas its sole characteristic is unrelatedness to consciousness, it\\nand the content of consciousness have nothing to do with\\neach other; and to make one the ground of asserting°any-thing\\nanything regarding the real nature of the other is absurd.°In-deed\\nIndeed, not only must specific relations between the object and\\nfeelings be asserted, but we find as matter of fact at least one\\nsuch implicitly posited, viz., that of cause and effect. The\\nabsolute object is the cause, the feeling is the effect. Now,\\nremember that by this same theory all knowledge comes\\nfrom feeling, and then ask how is it possible for the feeling\\nconsciousness to know this relation. At most, Sensationalism\\ncan mean by causation regular succession of feelings; but\\nthe characteristics of the supposed cause in this case are\\nprecisely that it is not a feeling, and (since it is°unknow-able\\nunknowable) that the succession has never been once observed, but\\nit is only by making this self-destructive assumption that the\\ntheory can get the slightest footing.\\nWe conclude on this point, therefore, that, to prove the\\nRelativity of Feeling, it must be assumed that there is an\\nabsolute object; that this object must be in consciousness,\\nand specifically related to the content of consciousness, and\\nthat these relations cannot be in the way of feeling. We must\\nknow that there is such an object; we must know what it is,\\nand the what must consist in its relation to thought. Perhaps\\na method of stating this conclusion which would appear less\\nformal, though not less expressive of the difficulty, would be\\nto say that whatever is explained must be explained by\\nreference to the known and not the unknown. Even were it\\n\\n ― 28 ―\\n                            \\nadmitted, e.g., that the cause of our feelings and that force\\nhave some transcendental existence entirely unrelated to°our-selves\\nourselves and entirely unknown, it would not be by such°un-knowns\\nunknowns that the relative character of our present feelings\\ncould be shown. To show or to explain is to bring the thing\\ninto relation with something known. Explanation of the\\nunknown by the known, not of the known by the unknown,\\nis the order of science.\\nAn examination of the specific feelings which are said\\nto be relative to the subject will both bring this point into\\nclearer light, and reveal in what, positively, their relativity\\ndoes consist. In a concrete case: Why is the feeling of color\\nas given in immediate consciousness said to be relative? Is\\nthe knowledge that it is such obtained by reference to a\\nknown or an unknown object? The question thus put°an-swers\\nanswers itself. The sensation of color is said to be relative to\\nourselves because it is known to be dependent upon°vibra-tions\\nvibrations of ether and the retinal structure of the eye. It is\\nmerely the relation between these two as given in°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness. Unless I know that there is such a retinal structure and\\nsuch waves, or something corresponding to them, it is°ab-surd\\nabsurd to speak of the feeling of color as relative. It is only\\nbecause I may know what light is as objective that I may\\nknow that what it seems to be in feeling is relative and\\nsubjective. And so with sound and taste. The subjectivity of\\ntaste, e.g., means that in the object unrelated to a nervous\\norganism there is such and such a physical or chemical\\nstructure, and that the sensation of taste is the relation\\nbetween that structure and a corresponding organic°struc-ture\\nstructure. Clearly, then, our knowledge of subjectivity or°relativ-ity\\nrelativity depends upon knowledge of something objective. But it\\nmust be especially noticed that this something objective is\\nnot given in feeling, and, therefore, is not relative to sense.\\nThese objects-the waves of ether, the structure of the°ret-ina\\nretina, etc.-are not themselves feelings, and never have been:\\nwere they feelings, there would be no reason to assert the\\nrelative character of the feelings following upon them.°Con-sequently\\nConsequently, if it should be said that these so-called objects, the\\nvibrations, etc., although not themselves feelings, yet have\\nmeaning attached to them only in so far as they represent\\n\\n ― 29 ―\\n                            \\npossibilities of feeling-and mean only that under certain\\nconditions they would become feelings, and that even now\\nthey possess signification only as symbolized by actual°sen-sations\\nsensations—the answer is ready. But, before giving it, we will\\nstate the objection more fully. It may be said that the objects\\nwe have supposed, the vibrations, etc., are, as known,°them-selves\\nthemselves conditioned by the affection of the nervous organism\\nthrough some other object, and so on indefinitely, so that,\\nafter all, our knowledge of them is entirely relative.\\nBut any such objection, to be of value, must hold that\\nthis process goes on ad infinitum, as otherwise there would\\nbe something known not through feeling, and, therefore, not\\nrelative. But if it does go on ad infinitum, it is clear that we\\nfall into our original difficulty: nothing will ever be known\\nexcept the immediate feelings, and to refer them to anything\\nexisting out of or beyond themselves will be impossible. The\\nmere fact that one feeling is the antecedent of another could\\nnever give any reason for asserting that that feeling was\\nrelative in comparison with an unknown object. To suppose\\nthat it could, is to suppose that a feeling may transcend its\\nown relativity. Therefore, on this theory of the infinite°re-gress\\nregress, it can never be known that there is an absolute object,\\nand, therefore, immediately present feelings can never be\\nreferred to such an object; i.e., can never be known to be\\nrelative. They become themselves absolute and absolutely\\nknown.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that to prove the relativity of\\nfeeling is impossible without assuming that there are objects\\nwhich are known not through feeling. In short,°Sensational-ism\\nSensationalism and the Relativity hypothesis again prove themselves\\nutterly incompatible. The theory of the Relativity of°Feel-ing\\nFeeling, therefore, is so far from proving the subjectivity of our\\nknowledge that it is impossible, except upon a theory which\\nassumes that we do have objective knowledge.\\nThe removal of a possible misapprehension and an\\nobjection are needed to complete the discussion of this point.\\nIt will perhaps be said that, since the relativity of feeling\\nwas known long before there was knowledge of what the\\nobjects really were, and that since now it is possible or\\nprobable, in some cases, that we do not really know the\\n\\n ― 30 ―\\n                            \\nobjective order, our account cannot be correct. But it must\\nbe noticed that this account does not depend for its°correct-ness\\ncorrectness upon the question whether objects are really what we\\nthink they are, but simply upon the question whether the\\ntheory of the Relativity of Feeling does not assume and\\nrequire that it is possible to so know them. And this question\\nis implicitly answered in the affirmative in this very°objec-tion\\nobjection; for, if our present knowledge is incorrect, this can be\\nshown only by reference to an established objective order to\\nwhich, by greater knowledge, it shall be shown that our\\npresent theories do not correspond.\\nOr, again, it may be said our account is incorrect,\\nbecause the real reason for calling a feeling relative is not\\nbecause we have any knowledge of the object as referred to\\nwhich it is relative, but simply because under the same\\nobjective conditions different persons have different°sensa-tions\\nsensations, or even the same person at different times. But°noth-ing\\nnothing is gained by this change in expression, since it assumes\\nthat there are permanent objective conditions, which must\\nbe known. For the two differing feelings are either known to\\nrefer to the same object or they are not. If not, all ground for\\ncalling them relative disappears. But, if they are, of course\\nthis object must be known. By any method of stating the\\ntheory, it will be found impossible to avoid reference to a\\nknown order objectively existing. In this connection it may\\nnot be without interest to quote Mr. Spencer\\'s summary of\\nthe theory as admitting implicitly, though unconsciously,\\njust this point. He says: \"The quality and the quantity of\\nthe sensation produced by a given amount of a given°exter-nal\\nexternal force vary not only with the structure of the organism,\\nspecific and individual, as well as the structure of the part\\naffected, but also with the age, the constitutional state of the\\npart as modified by temperature, circulation, and previous\\nuse, and even with the relative motion of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject.\" What we desire to call attention to are the two°admis-sions\\nadmissions or claims which he makes, all unconscious of their\\nbearing upon his theory. (1) That there is objectively \"a\\ngiven amount of a given force\"; and (2) that some nine\\nobjectively existing causes of the modification of this force\\nas given in feeling can be shown. In short, it is assumed that\\n\\n ― 31 ―\\n                            \\nthere is an objective force, the kind and amount of which is\\nknown, and that the causes which produce the variations of\\nthis in immediate feeling can be shown, and, consequently,\\neliminated.\\nSo far, our conclusions as to the relation of the theory\\nof Relativity of Feeling to the theory of knowledge have\\nbeen negative, and consisted in pointing out that it was not\\nconsistent with Sensationalism. But we are now prepared to\\ndraw a positive conclusion and say that the real meaning of\\nthe theory of Relativity of Feeling is that a feeling is a\\nspecific determinate relation or reaction given in°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness between two bodies, one a sensitive, the other a non-\\nsensitive object. It is possible to hold it, therefore, only in\\nconjunction with a theory which allows knowledge of these\\nobjects; furthermore, since we have knowledge of these\\nobjective conditions, the knowledge of their relation as given\\nin feeling, though relative indeed to the subject, is not for\\nthat reason a detraction from our knowledge of objects, but\\nrather an addition. One certainly cannot see a priori any\\nreason why the knowledge of the reactions of, say gold, in\\nthe presence of an acid should be an interesting addition to\\nour knowledge of these substances, while the knowledge of\\nits relation to a sensitive organism as given in feeling should\\nbe a deprivation of real knowledge. Except upon the theory\\nthat the real nature of things is their nature out of relation to\\neverything, knowledge of the mode of relation between an\\nobject and an organism is just as much genuine knowledge\\nas knowledge of its physical and chemical properties, which\\nin turn are only its relations.\\nLeaving the subject of feelings, we come to that of\\nrelations between feelings which it has also been attempted\\nto demonstrate to be purely relative to the subject, giving no\\nknowledge of objective relations. There is no reason to draw\\nupon the patience of readers to examine this view. It is\\nsubject to all the difficulties which we have made out against\\nthe like theory regarding feelings, besides laboring under\\nthe additional difficulty of having to show that these°rela-tions\\nrelations are themselves naught but feelings. Since we have\\nalready shown that the relativity of feelings to the subject\\ncannot be proved without assuming objective relations, the\\n\\n ― 32 ―\\n                            \\ncase stands, a fortiori, against any such attempt as the\\npresent. There is also a self-contradiction in the theory so\\nglaring that it might well have made any one pause who was\\nnot so mastered by the presuppositions of his system as to be\\nblind to the rules of ordinary logic. Sensationalism must and\\ndoes hold that all relations are reducible to feelings; are\\nthemselves, indeed, but kinds of feeling. But the theory of\\nRelativity supposes a relation between the subjective feeling\\nand the unknown object which is the absolute. But,°accord-ing\\naccording to Sensationalism, this relation must be a feeling. Hence\\nnothing exists but feelings, and relativity is a myth! If there\\nbe no real relations, there can be no relativity; and,°con-versely\\nconversely, to say that feelings are really relative is to say that a\\nrelation really and objectively is, and is known. But to say\\nthis is to abandon the position that relation is a kind of\\nfeeling, and thereby to abandon Sensationalism. The fact\\nthat the two positions are so often held in conjunction is only\\nevidence of how slightly the real meaning of either is\\ngrasped.\\nWe summarize our results as follows: The doctrine of\\nthe Relativity of Feeling is incompatible with°Sensational-ism\\nSensationalism, and is so for two reasons. First, Sensationalism can\\nnever give knowledge of the sine qua non of the Relativity\\ntheory: the existence of an absolute object. For the very\\nreason that sensation is relative to the subject, it can never\\ntranscend that relativity and make assertions regarding\\nsomething absolute. Secondly, even if the existence of the\\nabsolute object were assured, feeling qua feeling can never\\ndemonstrate its own relativity. The Absolute here as an\\nunknown Universal can never be known to be the Absolute\\nwhich constitutes the relativity of the present content of\\nconsciousness. The feelings must be definitely referred to\\nthat absolute object. For feeling itself to make any such\\nreference assumes that it can transcend its relativity, and\\nknow not only an absolute object, but what it is and what\\nrelations subsist between the two.\\nBut if this knowledge of the existence of an absolute\\nobject and of its determinate relations is not given by°feel-ing\\nfeeling, we are justified in saying that it is given by a°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness which by its relations determines the object. For, as we\\n\\n ― 33 ―\\n                            \\nhave shown that these objects must be related to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, and cannot be related in the way of feeling, what they\\ncan be except as determined and constituted by relations of\\nthis consciousness it is not easy to see. Since a feeling can be\\nknown as relative only when referred to an object, this\\nobject cannot be a feeling, nor constituted by a feeling. The\\nobject must, then, be relative to a thinking consciousness.\\nThere are two points which every theory of the°Relativ-ity\\nRelativity of Feeling must include and explain: (a) In what does\\nthe relative character of the feelings consist? (b) What is\\nthe nature of the correlate absolute? The sensationalist°hy-pothesis\\nhypothesis breaks down, as we have seen, at both these points.\\nBut our present theory, that relativity consists in a specific\\nratio between a sensitive and a non-sensitive object, which\\nare constituted by relations to self-consciousness, proves°it-self\\nitself, I think, amply adequate. Since relativity, according to\\nit, consists not in relation to a nervous organism, but to\\nconsciousness, the possibility of knowledge is provided for.\\nAnd, on the other hand, since this self-consciousness is the\\nground and source of relations, it cannot be subject to them.\\nIt is itself the true Absolute, then. This does not mean that it\\nis the Unrelated, but that it is not conditioned by those\\nconditions which determine its objects. Thus, we are saved\\nthe absurdity of believing in a relative which has no°corre-late\\ncorrelate absolute.\\nWe have thus considered the theory of the Relativity of\\nKnowledge in that form where it unites itself with and bases\\nitself upon feeling. The reader may see for himself how\\nlarge a portion of it would also apply to any theory of the\\nRelativity of Knowledge. In closing, we must repeat the\\ncaution with which we began: that we are not dealing with\\nthe theory of Relativity of Feeling as a psychological theory.\\nThe correctness of the theory is undoubted. The°philosophi-cal\\nphilosophical interpretation of it is the point in question. Its conditions\\nand implications need development, and we have attempted\\nto show that when they are developed the theory is°compati-ble\\ncompatible neither with Sensationalism, nor with Subjectivism, nor\\nwith Agnosticism; that it is compatible only with a theory\\nwhich admits the constitutive power of Thought, as itself\\nultimate Being, determining objects.\\n\\n ― 34 ―\\n                            \\nKant and Philosophic Method [First published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, XVIII\\n(April 1884), 162-74. Not reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nOn its subjective side, so far as individuals are concerned,\\nphilosophy comes into existence when men are confronted\\nwith problems and contradictions which common sense and\\nthe special sciences are able neither to solve nor resolve.\\nThere is felt the need of going deeper into things, of not\\nbeing content with hap-hazard views or opinions derived\\nfrom this or that science, but of having some principle\\nwhich, true on its account, may also serve to judge the truth\\nof all besides. It is no matter of accident that modern°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy begins, in Descartes, with a method which doubts all,\\nthat it may find that wherewith to judge all; nor is it°mean-ingless\\nmeaningless that Kant, the founder of modernist philosophy,\\ncommences his first great work with a similar demand, and\\n\"calls upon Reason to undertake the most difficult of tasks,\\nself-knowledge, and establish a tribunal to decide all°ques-tions\\nquestions according to its own eternal and unchangeable laws.\" See Kant\\'s Werke, Rosenkranz\\'s ed., vol. ii, p. 7.\\n»1\\nThis self-knowledge of Reason, then, is the Method and\\ncriterion which Kant offers.\\nBefore we may see what is involved in this, it is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to see what in gist the previous methods had been, and\\nwhy they had failed. The method of \"intellectualism\" begun\\nby Descartes and presented to Kant through Wolff was (in\\none word): Analysis of conceptions, with the law of identity\\nor non-contradiction for criterion. To discover truth is to\\nanalyze the problem down to those simple elements which\\ncannot be thought away, and reach a judgment whose°predi-cate\\npredicate may be clearly and distinctly seen to be identical with\\nits subject. Analytic thought, proceeding by the law of\\n\\n ― 35 ―\\n                            \\nidentity, gives the method for philosophic procedure. Now,\\nKant in his pre-critical period See especially his essay on attempt to introduce the idea ofnega-tive\\nnegative quantity into philosophy. Werke, vol. i.\\n»2 had become convinced that\\nanalysis does not explain such a conception as that which we\\nhave of causation: \"How one thing should arise out of\\nanother, when it is not connected with it, according to the\\nlaw of identity, this is a thing which I should much like to\\nhave explained.\" Werke, vol. i, p. 157.\\n»3 Nor again, while it may be, and°undoubt-edly\\nundoubtedly is, the method for pure thought, does it give any means\\nfor passing from thought to existence. This, he would say, is\\nno predicate of anything; it is part of no conception, and can\\nbe got by no analysis. Reality is added to our notions from\\nwithout, not evolved from them. But, if logical thought is\\nnot adequate to such notions as cause, nor able to reach\\nexistence, it can be no method for discovering Absolute\\nTruth.\\nSo Kant finds himself thrown into the arms of the\\nEmpiricists. It is experience which shows us the origin of an\\neffect in a cause, and experience which adds reality or°exist-ence\\nexistence to our thoughts. What, then, is the method of°\"Empiri-cism\\n\"Empiricism\"? Beginning with Bacon, at first it merely asserted that\\nthe mind must be freed from all subjective elements, and\\nbecome a mirror, to reflect the world of reality. But this, as\\ncriterion, is purely negative, and required the positive°com-plement\\ncomplement of Locke. This method in a word is, Analysis of\\nperceptions with agreement as criterion. In contrast with the\\nintellectual school, which began with conceptions supposed\\nto be found ready-made in the human mind, it begins with\\nthe perceptions impressed upon that blank tablet, the Mind,\\nby external objects, and finds \"knowledge to consist in the\\nperception of the connection or agreement or disagreement\\nof these ideas.\" But two questions arise: If truth or°knowl-edge\\nknowledge consists in perceptions, how, any more than from°con-ceptions\\nconceptions, shall we get to an external world? This question\\nwas answered by Berkeley in showing that, if knowledge\\nwere what this theory made it to be, the external world was\\njust that whose esse is percipi. The second question is:\\nWhat is agreement of perception? Agreement certainly\\n\\n ― 36 ―\\n                            \\nmeans, as Locke said, \"connexion,\" that is, mutual°refer-ence\\nreference, or synthesis. But how can this synthesis occur? The\\nmind is a blank, a wax tablet, a tabula rasa, whose sole\\nnature is receptivity, and certainly it can furnish no°syn-thesis\\nsynthesis. Locke had avoided the difficulty by assuming that\\nideas come to us or are \"given\" more or less conjoined—that\\none has naturally some bond of union with another. But this,\\nof course, cannot be. Simple impressions or perceptions are,\\nas Hume stated, such as admit of no distinction or°separa-tion\\nseparation, and these are the ultimate sensations. These have no\\nconnection with each other, except perhaps the accidental\\none of following or occurring together in time, and so it is\\nthat \"every distinct perception is a separate existence.\"°Nec-essary\\nNecessary connection among them, therefore, there can be none.\\nSensations are purely contingent, accidental, and external in\\ntheir relations to each other, with no bonds of union. Any\\nagreement is the result of chance or blind custom.°Knowl-edge\\nKnowledge as the necessary connection of perceptions does not\\nexist.\\nKant consequently discovers, by a more thorough\\nstudy of empiricism, that it too betrays him. It, no more than\\nhis former guides, can furnish him with a way of getting to\\nan external world nor to knowledge at all. Nay, even self,\\nsome ghost of which was left him by the other method, has\\ndisappeared too.\\nWhat has been the difficulty? Descartes did not come\\nto a stand-still at once, for he had tacitly presupposed the\\nsynthetic power of thought in itself—had even laid the\\nground for a theory of it in his reference to the Ego, or\\nself-consciousness. But his successors, neglecting this, and\\ndeveloping only the analytic aspect of thought, had°pro-duced\\nproduced a vacuum, where no step to existence or actual°rela-tions\\nrelations, being synthetic, could be taken. \"Conceptions are\\nempty.\" Nor had Locke been estopped immediately, for he\\npresupposed some synthesis in the objective world; but it\\nturns out that he had no right to it, and world, self, and all\\nactual relations, being synthetic, have gone. \"Perceptions\\nare blind.\" The problem, then, is clearly before Kant, as is\\nthe key to its solution. Synthesis is the sine qua non.°Knowl-edge\\nKnowledge is synthesis, and the explanation of knowledge or truth\\n\\n ― 37 ―\\n                            \\nmust be found in the explanation of synthesis. Hence the\\nquestion of Method is now the question: How are synthetic\\njudgments a priori possible? A priori means simply°belong-ing\\nbelonging to Reason in its own nature, so the question is, How and\\nto what extent is Reason the source of synthesis?\\nThe case stands thus: Pure thought is purely analytic;\\nexperience per se gives only a blind rhapsody of particulars,\\nwithout meaning or connection—actual experience, or\\nknowledge involves, is synthesis. How shall it be got? One\\npath remains open. We may suppose that while thought in\\nitself is analytic, it is synthetic when applied to a material\\ngiven it, and that from this material, by its functions, it\\nforms the objects which it knows. And such, in its lowest\\nterms, is the contribution Kant makes. The material, the\\nmanifold, the particulars, are furnished by Sense in°percep-tion\\nperception; the conceptions, the synthetic functions from Reason\\nitself, and the union of these two elements are required, as\\nwell for the formation of the object known, as for its°know-ing\\nknowing.\\nTo characterize Kant\\'s contribution to Method, it°re-mains\\nremains to briefly examine these two sides of his theory: First,\\nfor the part played by the synthetic functions or the°catego-ries\\ncategories. These, in first intention, are so many conceptions of the\\nunderstanding, and, as such, subject to analysis according to\\nthe law of identity, and thus furnish the subject-matter of\\nLogic. But they also have relation to objects, and, as such,\\nare synthetic and furnish the subject-matter of°Transcen-dental\\nTranscendental Logic, whose work is to demonstrate and explain their\\nobjective validity. This is done by showing that \"the°catego-ries\\ncategories make experience and its objects for the first time°possi-ble\\npossible.\" That is to say, Kant, after showing that the principles\\nof identity and contradiction, though the highest criteria of\\nlogical thought, can give no aid in determining the truths of\\nactual experience, inquires what is the criterion of truth for\\nthe latter, or what comes to the same thing, of the synthetic\\nuse of the categories as Transcendental Logic—and the°an-swer\\nanswer he finds to be \"possible experience\" itself. In other\\nwords, the categories have objective validity or synthetic use\\nbecause without them no experience would be possible. If\\nHume, for example, asks how we can have assurance that\\n\\n ― 38 ―\\n                            \\nthe notion of causality has any worth when applied to°ob-jects\\nobjects, he is answered by showing that without this notion\\nexperience as an intelligible connected system would not\\nexist. By the categories the objects of experience are°consti-tuted\\nconstituted, and hence their objective validity.\\nIt follows, accordingly, that the system of experience\\nmay be determined, as to its form, by a completely made out\\nsystem of categories. In them, as synthetic functions,°consti-tuting\\nconstituting experience, we find the criterion of truth. But they\\nthemselves have a higher condition. As synthetic functions,\\nthey must all be functions of a higher unity which is subject\\nto none of them. And this Kant calls the synthetic unity of\\nApperception or, in brief, self-consciousness. This is the\\nhighest condition of experience, and in the developed notion\\nof self-consciousness we find the criterion of truth. The\\ntheory of self-consciousness is Method.\\nBut this abstract statement must be farther developed.\\nIt comes to saying, on the one hand, that the criterion of the\\ncategories is possible experience, and on the other, that the\\ncriterion of possible experience is the categories and their\\nsupreme condition. This is evidently a circle, yet a circle\\nwhich, Kant would say, exists in the case itself, which\\nexpresses the very nature of knowledge. It but states that in\\nknowledge there is naught but knowledge which knows or is\\nknown—the only judge of knowledge, of experience, is°expe-rience\\nexperience itself. And experience is a system, a real whole made\\nup of real parts. It as a whole is necessarily implied in every\\nfact of experience, while it is constituted in and through\\nthese facts. In other terms, the relation of categories to°ex-perience\\nexperience is the relation of members of an organism to a\\nwhole. The criterion of knowledge is neither anything°out-side\\noutside of knowledge, nor a particular conception within the\\nsphere of knowledge which is not subject to the system as a\\nwhole; it is just this system which is constituted, so far as its\\nform is concerned, by the categories.\\nPhilosophic Method, or the discovering of the criterion\\nof truth, will consist, then, in no setting up of a transcendent\\nobject as the Empiricists did, or of an abstract principle\\nafter the manner of the intellectual school. Since the°catego-ries\\ncategories, in and through self-consciousness, constitute°experi-ence\\n ― 39 ―\\n                            \\nexperience, Method will consist in making out a complete table of\\nthese categories in all their mutual relations, giving each its\\nproper placing, with the full confidence that when so placed\\neach will have its proper place in experience, i.e., its°capac-ity\\ncapacity for expressing reality determined.\\nBut we have now strayed far from Kant. While having\\nsaid nothing which is not deducible from his Transcendental\\nLogic, we have abstracted from the fact that this holds only\\nof the form of our knowledge; that there is also an æsthetic,\\nand that thought is synthetic, not in itself, but only upon a\\nmaterial supplied to it from without. Turning to this, we\\nfind the aspect of affairs changed. Though the categories\\nmake experience, they make it out of a foreign material to\\nwhich they bear a purely external relation. They constitute\\nobjects, but these objects are not such in universal reference,\\nbut only to beings of like capacities of receptivity as°our-selves\\nourselves. They respect not existence in itself, but ourselves as\\naffected by that existence. The system of categories°fur-nishes\\nfurnishes the criterion for all the knowledge we have, but this\\nturns out to be no real knowledge. It is, Hegel says, as if one\\nascribed correct insight to a person, and then added that he\\ncould see only into the untruth, not the truth. Nor does the\\ndeficiency of our method end here. We had previously°as-sumed\\nassumed that the categories as a system, or in their organic\\nrelation to self-consciousness, could be known. But it now\\nturns out that nothing can be known except that to which\\nthis feeling of external matter through sensibility is given.\\nTo know this subject, or self-consciousness, is to make an\\nobject of it, and every object is sensible, that is, has a feeling\\nwhich tells us how we are affected. But such a knowledge is\\nevidently no knowledge of self-consciousness in its own°na-ture\\nnature. Thus, so far as knowledge is concerned, it must remain\\na bare form of self-identity, of \"I=I,\" into definite organic\\nrelations with which the categories can never be brought.\\nHence, it appears that our picture of a method was doubly\\nfalse—false in that after all it could not reach truth; false in\\nthat after all no such method was in itself possible. Our\\norganic system of categories cannot constitute absolute truth\\n—and no such organic system is itself knowable. Criterion\\nand method we are still without. The golden prize, which\\n\\n ― 40 ―\\n                            \\nseemed just within our hands as long as we confined°our-selves\\nourselves to the Transcendental Logic, turns out to be a tinsel\\nsuperfluity.\\nYet, none the less, there was the suggestion of a\\nmethod there, which is exactly what we wish. The only\\nquestion is: Is its reference to the Æsthetic necessary? Is the\\nlatter a necessary part of Kant\\'s theory, or, so far as it\\nconcerns the reception of external matter, an excrescence?\\nThe question is just here: Previous methods failed because\\nthey made no allowance for synthesis—Kant\\'s because the\\nsynthesis can occur only upon matter foreign to it. Thought\\nin the previous theories was purely analytic; in Kant\\'s it is\\npurely synthetic, in that it is synthesis of foreign material.\\nWere thought at once synthetic and analytic, differentiating\\nand integrating in its own nature, both affirmative and°nega-tive\\nnegative, relating to self at the same time that it related to other\\n—indeed, through this relation to other-the difficulty would\\nnot have arisen.\\nIs the state of the case as Kant supposes? Must we say\\nthat Reason is synthetic only upon condition that material be\\ngiven it to act upon, or, may it be, that while we must say\\nthat for the individual the material, nay, the form as°indissol-ubly\\nindissolubly connected with the material, is given, yet, to Reason\\nitself, nothing is given in the sense of being foreign to it?\\nA slight examination will show us that, at least as far\\nas Kant is concerned, the former supposition is but an°arbi-trary\\narbitrary limitation or assumption, which Kant imposed upon\\nhimself, or received without question from previous°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy. On one side, he had learned that pure thought is\\nanalytic; on the other, that the individual is affected with\\nsensations impressed upon it by external objects. At the\\nsame time that he corrects both of these doctrines with his\\nown deduction of the categories, he formally retains both\\nerrors.\\nSo we have him asking at the very outset, as a matter\\nof course: \"In what other way is it to be conceived that the\\nknowing power can be excited to activity, except by objects\\nwhich affect our senses?\" That is to say, he assumes at the\\noutset that there is something external to Reason by which it\\nmust be excited. He perceives, what all admit, that an°indi-vidual\\n ― 41 ―\\n                            \\nindividual organized in a certain specific way with certain°sen-ses\\nsenses, and external things acting upon these senses, are°condi-tions\\nconditions to our knowledge, and then proceeds to identify°respec-tively\\nrespectively this individual with the subject, and these things with\\nthe object, in the process of knowledge. But here it is that\\nwe ask with what right does he make this identification. If it\\nis made, then surely the case stands with Reason as he says\\nit does—it acts only upon a material foreign to it. Yet this\\nindividual and these things are but known objects already\\nconstituted by the categories, and existing only for the°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic unity of apperception or self-consciousness. This,\\nthen, is the real subject, and the so-called subject and object\\nare but the forms in which it expresses its own activity. In\\nshort, the relation of subject and object is not a°\"transcend-ent\\n\"transcendent\" one, but an \"immanent,\" and is but the first form in\\nwhich Reason manifests that it is both synthetic and°ana-lytic\\nanalytic; that it separates itself from itself, that it may thereby\\nreach higher unity with itself. It is the highest type of the\\nlaw which Reason follows everywhere. The material which\\nwas supposed to confront Reason as foreign to it is but the\\nmanifestation of Reason itself. Such, at least, are the results\\nwhich we reach in the Transcendental Deduction, and such\\nare the results we consider ourselves justified to keep in\\nopposition to Kant\\'s pure assumptions.\\nWe see the same thing in Kant\\'s theory of°phenome-non\\nphenomenon. Just as, concerning the process of knowledge, he°as-sumes\\nassumes that subject and object are in external relation to each\\nother, and hence Reason in contact with a foreign material,\\nso here he assumes that the character of phenomenality\\nconsists in relation to an unknowable noumenon. The°phe-nomenon\\nphenomenon is referred to something outside of experience,°in-stead\\ninstead of being defined by its relation within experience—in\\nwhich case it would be seen to be a phenomenon in its own\\nnature, in that the categories which constitute it as such are\\nnot adequate to truth.\\nWe have but to turn to Kant\\'s derivation of the°catego-ries\\ncategories, to be again assured that Kant\\'s theory of Reason as\\nsynthetic only in reference to foreign material is one purely\\nassumed. As is notorious, these he took from the Logic of\\nthe School, which he held to give a complete table of all the\\n\\n ― 42 ―\\n                            \\nforms of pure thought. When we turn to this table we find\\nthe highest point reached in it to be reciprocity. Now,°reci-procity\\nreciprocity is precisely that external relation of two things to\\neach other that we have already found existing, in Kant\\'s\\ntheory, between subject and object in Knowledge—the°rela-tions\\nrelations of things that are independent of each other but°mu-tually\\nmutually act upon each other. So, too, it is but another way of\\nstating that Thought, analytic in itself, is synthetic when\\napplied to an external material, or that this material, blind\\nand hap-hazard in itself, is formed by something acting\\nupon it. When Kant tells us, therefore, that the categories\\nare not limited in their own nature, but become so when\\napplied, as they must be, to determine space and time, we\\nhave in our hands the means of correcting him. They are\\nlimited, and express just the limitation of Kant himself. And\\nKant confesses their insufficiency as soon as he takes up the\\nquestions of moral and æsthetic experience and of life itself.\\nHere we find the categories of freedom determined by ends,\\nfree production, organism to be everywhere present, while\\nall through his Critiques is woven in the notion of an°intui-tive\\nintuitive understanding which is the ultimate criterion of all\\ntruth, and this understanding is just what we have already\\nmet as the organic system of experience or°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness.\\nWhether we consider the relations of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, or the nature of the categories, we find ourselves forced\\ninto the presence of the notion of organic relation. The\\nrelation between subject and object is not an external one; it\\nis one in a higher unity which is itself constituted by this\\nrelation. The only conception adequate to experience as a\\nwhole is organism. What is involved in the notion of°organ-ism\\norganism? Why, precisely the Idea which we had formerly\\nreached of a Reason which is both analytic and synthetic, a\\nReason which differentiates itself that it may integrate itself\\ninto fuller riches, a Reason that denies itself that it may\\nbecome itself. Such a Reason, and neither an analytic\\nThought, nor an analytic Experience, nor a Reason which is\\nanalytic in itself, and synthetic for something else, is the\\nultimate criterion of truth, and the theory of this Reason is\\nthe Philosophic Method.\\n\\n ― 43 ―\\n                            \\nThe two defects which we found before in Kant\\'s theory\\nnow vanish. The method is no longer one which can reach\\nuntruth only, nor is it a method which cannot be made out.\\nThe track which we were upon in following the course of\\nthe Transcendental Deduction was the right one. The°crite-rion\\ncriterion of experience is the system of categories in their organic\\nunity in self-consciousness, and the method consists in°deter-mining\\ndetermining this system and the part each plays in constituting it.\\nThe method takes the totality of experience to pieces, and\\nbrings before us its conditions in their entirety. The°rela-tions\\nrelations of its content, through which alone this content has\\ncharacter and meaning, whereby it becomes an intelligible,\\nconnected whole, must be made to appear.\\nIt was the suggestion of this method, it was the\\nsuggestion of so many means for its execution, it was the\\nactual carrying of it out in so many points that makes Kant\\'s\\n\"Philosophy\" the critical philosophy, and his work the°cri-sis\\ncrisis, the separating, dividing, turning-point of modern°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy, and this hurried sketch would not be complete if we\\ndid not briefly point out what steps have been taken toward\\nthe fulfilling of the Ideal. This is found chiefly in Hegel and\\nhis \"Logic.\" We can only discuss in the light of what has\\nalready been said why Hegel begins with Logic; why the\\nnegative plays so important a part in his philosophy, and\\nwhat is the meaning of Dialectic.\\n\\n1. LOGIC. One of Hegel\\'s repeated charges against Kant is\\nthat he examines the categories with reference to their°objec-tive\\nobjective character, and not to determine their own meaning and\\nworth. At first it might seem as if this were the best way to\\ndetermine their worth, but it ought now to be evident that\\nsuch a procedure is both to presuppose that they are°subjec-tive\\nsubjective in themselves, and that we have a ready-made°concep-tion\\nconception of object by which to judge them—in short, it amounts\\nto saying that these conceptions are purely analytic, and\\nhave meaning only in relation to an external material. Hence\\nthe method must examine the categories without any°refer-ence\\nreference to subjective or objective existences; or, to speak°prop-erly\\nproperly, since we now see that there are no purely subjective\\nor objective existences, without any relation to things and\\n\\n ― 44 ―\\n                            \\nthoughts as two distinct spheres. The antithesis between\\nthem is not to be blinked out of sight, but it must be treated\\nas one which exists within Reason, and not one with one\\nterm in and the other out. The categories which, for the\\nindividual, determine the nature of the object, and those\\nwhich state how the object is brought into the subjective\\nform of cognition, must be deduced from Reason alone. A\\ntheory performing this task is what Hegel calls Logic, and is\\nneeded not only to overcome Kant\\'s defects, but is°immedi-ately\\nimmediately suggested by his positive accomplishments. In our\\naccount of the Transcendental Deduction we saw that self-\\nconsciousness was the supreme condition of all the°catego-ries\\ncategories, and hence can be subject in itself to none of them.\\nWhen it is made subject we have no longer the absolute\\nself-consciousness, but the empirical ego, the object of the\\ninner sense. In short, the categories constitute the°individu-als\\nindividuals as an object of experience, just as much as they do the\\nmaterial known. Hence they are no more subjective than\\nobjective. We may call them indifferently neither or both.\\nThe truth is, they belong to a sphere where the antithesis\\nbetween subject and object is still potential, or an sich. It is\\nevident, therefore, that logic, in the Hegelian use, is just\\nthat criterion of truth which we thought at first to find in\\nKant\\'s Transcendental Logic—it is an account of the°concep-tions\\nconceptions or categories of Reason which constitute experience,\\ninternal and external, subjective and objective, and an°ac-count\\naccount of them as a system, an organic unity in which each\\nhas its own place fixed. It is the completed Method of\\nPhilosophy.\\n\\n2. THE NEGATIVE IN HEGEL. It ought now to be evident\\nthat any philosophy which can pretend to be a method of\\ntruth must show Reason as both analytic and synthetic. If\\nHistory can demonstrate anything, it has demonstrated this,\\nboth by its successes and its failures. Reason must be that\\nwhich separates itself, which differentiates, goes forth into\\ndifferences, that it may then grasp these differences into a\\nunity of its own. It cannot unite unless there be difference;\\nthere can be no synthesis where there is not analysis. On the\\nother hand, the differences must remain forever foreign to\\n\\n ― 45 ―\\n                            \\nReason unless it brings them together; there can be no\\nanalysis where there is not synthesis, or a unity to be°di-rempted\\ndirempted. If there be no synthesis in Reason, we end in the\\nimpotence of the former school of intellectualism, or in the\\nhelpless scepticism of Hume; if Reason be synthetic only\\nupon a foreign material, we end in the contradictions of\\nKant. If there is to be knowledge, Reason must include both\\nelements within herself. It is Hegel\\'s thorough recognition\\nof this fact that causes him to lay such emphasis on the\\nnegative. Pure affirmation or identity reaches its summit in\\nSpinoza, where all is lost in the infinite substance of infinite\\nattributes, as waves in the sea. Yet even Spinoza was obliged\\nto introduce the negative, the determinations, the modes,\\nthough he never could succeed in getting them by any\\nmeans from his pure affirmation. In Hume we find pure\\ndifference or negation, the manifold particularization of°sen-sations\\nsensations, but even he is obliged to introduce synthetic°princi-ples\\nprinciples in the laws of association, though he never succeeds in\\nlegitimately deriving them from sensations, for a \"consistent\\nsensationalism is speechless.\" Kant had tried a compromise\\nof the principle, synthesis from within, difference from°with-out\\nwithout. That, too, failed to give us knowledge or a criterion of\\nTruth. Hegel comprehends the problem, and offers us°Rea-son\\nReason affirmative and negative, and affirmative only in and\\nthrough its own negations, as the solution.\\n\\n3. DIALECTIC. We have now the notion of Dialectic before\\nus in its essential features. We have seen that the desired\\nobject is a theory of the Conceptions of Reason in an organic\\nsystem, and that Reason is itself both integrating and°differ-entiating\\ndifferentiating. Dialectic is the construction by Reason, through\\nits successive differentiations and resumptions of these°dif-ferences\\ndifferences into higher unities, of just this system. If we take\\nany single category of Reason—that is to say, some°concep-tion\\nconception which we find involved in the system of experience—this\\nis one specific form into which Reason has unified or°\"syn-thesized\\n\"synthesized\" itself. Reason itself is immanent in this category;\\nbut, since Reason is also differentiating or analytic, Reason\\nmust reveal itself as such in this category, which°accord-ingly\\naccordingly passes, or is reflected, or develops into its opposite,\\n\\n ― 46 ―\\n                            \\nwhile the two conceptions are then resumed into the higher\\nunity of a more concrete conception.\\nSince the system of knowledge is implicit in each of its\\nmembers, each category must judge itself, or rather,°Rea-son\\nReason, in its successive forms, passes judgment on its own\\ninadequacy until the adequate is reached—and this can be\\nnothing but Reason no longer implicit, but developed into its\\ncompleted system. Reason must everywhere, and in all its\\nforms, propose itself as what it is, viz., absolute or adequate\\nto the entire truth of experience; but, since at first its form is\\nstill inadequate, it must show what is absolutely implicit in\\nit, viz., the entire system. That at first it does, by doing what\\nit is the nature of the Reason which it manifests to do, by\\ndifferencing itself, or passing into its opposite, its other; but,\\nsince Reason is also synthetic, grasping together, these°dif-ferences\\ndifferences must resolve themselves into a higher unity. Thus,\\nReason continues until it has developed itself into the°con-ception\\nconception which is in form equal to what itself is in content, or,\\nuntil it has manifested all that it is implicitly. A twofold\\nprocess has occurred. On the one hand, each special form of\\nReason or Category has been placed; that is, its degree of\\nability to state absolute truth fixed by its place in the whole\\norganic system. On the other, the system itself has been\\ndeveloped; that is to say, as Reason goes on manifesting its\\nown nature through successive differences and unities, each\\nlower category is not destroyed, but retained-but retained\\nat its proper value. Each, since it is Reason, has its relative\\ntruth; but each, since Reason is not yet adequately°mani-fested\\nmanifested, has only a relative truth. The Idea is the completed\\ncategory, and this has for its meaning or content Reason\\nmade explicit or manifested; that is, all the stages or types of\\nReason employed in reaching it. \"The categories are not\\nerrors, which one goes through on the way to the truth, but\\nphases of truth. Their completed system in its organic\\nwholeness is the Truth.\" And such a system is at once\\nphilosophic Method and Criterion; method, because it shows\\nus not only the way to reach truth, but truth itself in°con-struction\\nconstruction; criterion, because it gives us the form of°experi-ence\\nexperience to which all the facts of experience as organic members\\nmust conform.\\n\\n ― 47 ―\\n                            \\nIt will be seen, I hope, that we have not left our\\nsubject, \"Kant\\'s Relation to Philosophic Method\"; for a\\ncrisis is nothing in itself. It is a crisis only as it is the\\nturning-point; and a turning-point is the old passing into the\\nnew, and can be understood only as the old and the new are\\nunderstood. The criterion of Kant is just this turning-point;\\nit is the transition of the old abstract thought, the old°mean-ingless\\nmeaningless conception of experience, into the new concrete\\nthought, the ever growing, ever rich experience.\\n\\n ― 48 ―\\n                            \\nThe New Psychology [First published in the Andover Review, II (Sept. 1884), 278-89.\\nNot reprinted by the author.]\\n»*\\nBacon\\'s dictum regarding the proneness of the mind, in\\nexplanation, towards unity and simplicity, at no matter what\\nsacrifice of material, has found no more striking°exemplifi-cation\\nexemplification than that offered in the fortunes of psychology. The\\nleast developed of the sciences, for a hundred years it has\\nborne in its presentations the air of the one most completely\\nfinished. The infinite detail and complexity of the simplest\\npsychical life, its interweavings with the physical organism,\\nwith the life of others in the social organism,—created no\\nspecial difficulty; and in a book like James Mill\\'s Analysis\\nwe find every mental phenomenon not only explained, but\\nexplained by reference to one principle. That rich and°col-ored\\ncolored experience, never the same in two nations, in two\\nindividuals, in two moments of the same life,—whose\\nthoughts, desires, fears, and hopes have furnished the°mate-rial\\nmaterial for the ever-developing literature of the ages, for a\\nHomer and a Chaucer, a Sophocles and a Shakespeare, for\\nthe unwritten tragedies and comedies of daily life,—was\\nneatly and carefully dissected, its parts labeled and stowed\\naway in their proper pigeon-holes, the inventory taken, and\\nthe whole stamped with the stamp of un fait accompli.\\nSchematism was supreme, and the air of finality was over\\nall.\\nWe know better now. We know that that life of man\\nwhose unfolding furnishes psychology its material is the\\nmost difficult and complicated subject which man can°inves-tigate\\ninvestigate. We have some consciousness of its ramifications and\\nof its connections. We see that man is somewhat more than\\na neatly dovetailed psychical machine who may be taken as\\nan isolated individual, laid on the dissecting table of analysis\\n\\n ― 49 ―\\n                            \\nand duly anatomized. We know that his life is bound up\\nwith the life of society, of the nation in the ethos and nomos;\\nwe know that he is closely connected with all the past by the\\nlines of education, tradition, and heredity; we know that\\nman is indeed the microcosm who has gathered into himself\\nthe riches of the world, both of space and of time, the world\\nphysical and the world psychical. We know also of the\\ncomplexities of the individual life. We know that our mental\\nlife is not a syllogistic sorites, but an enthymeme most of\\nwhose members are suppressed; that large tracts never come\\ninto consciousness; that those which do get into°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, are vague and transitory, with a meaning hard to catch\\nand read; are infinitely complex, involving traces of the\\nentire life history of the individual, or are vicarious, having\\nsignificance only in that for which they stand; that psychical\\nlife is a continuance, having no breaks into \"distinct ideas\\nwhich are separate existences\"; that analysis is but a process\\nof abstraction, leaving us with a parcel of parts from which\\nthe \"geistige Band\" is absent; that our distinctions, however\\nnecessary, are unreal and largely arbitrary; that mind is no\\ncompartment box nor bureau of departmental powers; in\\nshort, that we know almost nothing about the actual°activi-ties\\nactivities and processes of the soul. We know that the old°psychol-ogy\\npsychology gave descriptions of that which has for the most part no\\nexistence, and which at the best it but described and did not\\nexplain.\\nI do not say this to depreciate the work of the earlier\\npsychologists. There is no need to cast stones at those who,\\nhaving a work to do, did that work well and departed. With\\nSir William Hamilton and J. Stuart Mill the school passed\\naway. It is true that many psychologists still use their°lan-guage\\nlanguage and follow their respective fashions. Their influence,\\nno doubt, is yet everywhere felt. But changed conditions are\\nupon us, and thought, no more than revolution, goes°back-ward\\nbackward. Psychology can live no better in the past than°physiol-ogy\\nphysiology or physics; but there is no more need for us to revile\\nHume and Reid for not giving birth to a full and complete\\nscience, than there is for complaining that Newton did not\\nanticipate the physical knowledge of to-day, or Harvey the\\nphysiological.\\n\\n ― 50 ―\\n                            \\nThe work of the earlier psychologists bore a definite\\nand necessary relation both to the scientific conditions and\\nthe times in which it was done. If they had recognized the\\ncomplexity of the subject and attempted to deal with it, the\\nscience would never have been begun. The very condition of\\nits existence was the neglect of the largest part of the°mate-rial\\nmaterial, the seizing of a few schematic ideas and principles, and\\ntheir use for universal explanation. Very mechanical and\\nvery abstract to us, no doubt, seems their division of the\\nmind into faculties, the classification of mental phenomena\\ninto the regular, graded, clear-cut series of sensation, image,\\nconcept, etc.; but let one take a look into the actual processes\\nof his own mind, the actual course of the mental life there\\nrevealed, and he will realize how utterly impossible were the\\ndescription, much more the explanation, of what goes on\\nthere, unless the larger part of it were utterly neglected, and\\na few broad schematic rubrics seized by which to reduce this\\nswimming chaos to some semblance of order.\\nAgain, the history of all science demonstrates that\\nmuch of its progress consists in bringing to light problems.\\nLack of consciousness of problems, even more than lack of\\nability to solve them, is the characteristic of the°non-scien-tific\\nnon-scientific mind. Problems cannot be solved till they are seen and\\nstated, and the work of the earlier psychologists consisted\\nlargely in this sort of work. Further, they were filled with\\nthe Zeitgeist of their age, the age of the eighteenth century\\nand the Aufklärung, which found nothing difficult, which\\nhated mystery and complexity, which believed with all its\\nheart in principles, the simpler and more abstract the better,\\nand which had the passion of completion. By this spirit, the\\npsychologists as well as the other thinkers of the day were\\nmastered, and under its influence they thought and wrote.\\nThus their work was conditioned by the nature of\\nscience itself, and by the age in which they lived. This work\\nthey did, and left to us a heritage of problems, of°terminol-ogy\\nterminology, and of principles which we are to solve, reject, or\\nemploy as best we may. And the best we can do is to thank\\nthem, and then go about our own work; the worst is to make\\nthem the dividing lines of schools, or settle in hostile camps\\naccording to their banners. We are not called upon to defend\\n\\n ― 51 ―\\n                            \\nthem, for their work is in the past; we are not called upon to\\nattack them, for our work is in the future.\\nIt will be of more use briefly to notice some of the\\nmovements and tendencies which have brought about the\\nchange of attitude, and created what may be called the\\n\"New Psychology.\"\\nNot the slightest of these movements has been, of\\ncourse, the reaction of the present century, from the°ab-stract\\nabstract, if clear, principles of the eighteenth, towards°con-crete\\nconcrete detail, even though it be confused. The general failure\\nof the eighteenth century in all but destructive°accomplish-ment\\naccomplishment forced the recognition of the fact that the universe is\\nnot so simple and easy a matter to deal with, after all; that\\nthere are many things in earth, to say nothing of heaven,\\nwhich were not dreamed of in the philosophy of clearness\\nand abstraction, whether that philosophy had been applied\\nalong the lines of the state, society, religion, or science. The\\nworld was sated with system and longed for fact. The age\\nbecame realistic. That the movement has been accompanied\\nwith at least temporary loss in many directions, with the\\nperishing of ideals, forgetfulness of higher purpose, decay of\\nenthusiasm, absorption in the petty, a hard contentedness in\\nthe present, or a cynical pessimism as to both present and\\nfuture, there can be no doubt. But neither may it be doubted\\nthat the movement was a necessity to bring the Antæus of\\nhumanity back to the mother soil of experience, whence it\\nderives its strength and very life, and to prevent it from\\nlosing itself in a substanceless vapor where its ideals and\\npurposes become as thin and watery as the clouds towards\\nwhich it aspires.\\nOut of this movement and as one of its best aspects\\ncame that organized, systematic, tireless study into the°se-crets\\nsecrets of nature, which, counting nothing common or°un-clean\\nunclean, thought no drudgery beneath it, or rather thought\\nnothing drudgery,—that movement which with its results\\nhad been the great revelation given to the nineteenth century\\nto make. In this movement psychology took its place, and in\\nthe growth of physiology which accompanied it I find the\\nfirst if not the greatest occasion of the development of the\\nNew Psychology.\\n\\n ― 52 ―\\n                            \\nIt is a matter in every one\\'s knowledge that, with the\\nincrease of knowledge regarding the structure and functions\\nof the nervous system, there has arisen a department of\\nscience known as physiological psychology, which has°al-ready\\nalready thrown great light upon psychical matters. But unless\\nI entirely misapprehend the popular opinion regarding the\\nmatter, there is very great confusion and error in this°opin-ion\\nopinion, regarding the relations of this science to psychology.\\nThis opinion, if I rightly gather it, is, that physiological\\npsychology is a science which does, or at least claims to,\\nexplain all psychical life by reference to the nature of the\\nnervous system. To illustrate: very many professed°popular-izers\\npopularizers of the results of scientific inquiry, as well as laymen,\\nseem to think that the entire psychology of vision is°ex-plained\\nexplained when we have a complete knowledge of the anatomy\\nof the retina, of its nervous connection with the brain, and of\\nthe centre in the latter which serves for visual functions; or\\nthat we know all about memory if we can discover that\\ncertain brain cells store up nervous impressions, and certain\\nfibres serve to connect these cells,—the latter producing the\\nassociation of ideas, while the former occasion their°repro-duction\\nreproduction. In short, the commonest view of physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology seems to be that it is a science which shows that\\nsome or all of the events of our mental life are physically\\nconditioned upon certain nerve-structures, and thereby°ex-plains\\nexplains these events. Nothing could be further from the truth.\\nSo far as I know, all the leading investigators clearly realize\\nthat explanations of psychical events, in order to explain,\\nmust themselves be psychical and not physiological.°How-ever\\nHowever important such knowledge as that of which we have\\njust been speaking may be for physiology, it has of itself no\\nvalue for psychology. It tells simply what and how°physio-logical\\nphysiological elements serve as a basis for psychical acts; what the\\nlatter are, or how they are to be explained, it tells us not at\\nall. Physiology can no more, of itself, give us the what, why,\\nand how of psychical life, than the physical geography of a\\ncountry can enable us to construct or explain the history of\\nthe nation that has dwelt within that country. However\\nimportant, however indispensable the land with all its°quali-ties\\nqualities is as a basis for that history, that history itself can be\\n\\n ― 53 ―\\n                            \\nascertained and explained only through historical records\\nand historic conditions. And so psychical events can be\\nobserved only through psychical means, and interpreted and\\nexplained by psychical conditions and facts.\\nWhat can be meant, then, by saying that the rise of\\nthis physiological psychology has produced a revolution in\\npsychology? This: that it has given a new instrument,°intro-duced\\nintroduced a new method,—that of experiment, which has°supple-mented\\nsupplemented and corrected the old method of introspection.\\nPsychical facts still remain psychical, and are to be°ex-plained\\nexplained through psychical conditions; but our means of\\nascertaining what these facts are and how they are°condi-tioned\\nconditioned have been indefinitely widened. Two of the chief°ele-ments\\nelements of the method of experiment are variation of°condi-tions\\nconditions at the will and under the control of the experimenter,\\nand the use of quantitative measurement. Neither of these\\nelements can be applied through any introspective process.\\nBoth may be through physiological psychology. This starts\\nfrom the well-grounded facts that the psychical events\\nknown as sensations arise through bodily stimuli, and that\\nthe psychical events known as volitions result in bodily\\nmovements; and it finds in these facts the possibility of the\\napplication of the method of experimentation. The bodily\\nstimuli and movements may be directly controlled and\\nmeasured, and thereby, indirectly, the psychical states which\\nthey excite or express.\\nThere is no need at this day to dwell upon the°advan-tages\\nadvantages derived in any science from the application of°experi-ment\\nexperiment. We know well that it aids observation by indefinitely\\nincreasing the power of analysis and by permitting exact\\nmeasurement, and that it equally aids explanation by°ena-bling\\nenabling us so to vary the constituent elements of the case\\ninvestigated as to select the indispensable. Nor is there need\\nto call attention to the especial importance of experiment in a\\nscience where introspection is the only direct means of°ob-servation\\nobservation. We are sufficiently aware of the defects of°intro-spection\\nintrospection. We know that it is limited, defective, and often\\nillusory as a means of observation, and can in no way°di-rectly\\ndirectly explain. To explain is to mediate; to connect the given\\nfact with an unseen principle; to refer the phenomenon to an\\n\\n ― 54 ―\\n                            \\nantecedent condition,—while introspection can deal only\\nwith the immediate present, with the given now. This is not\\nthe place to detail the specific results accomplished through\\nthis application of experiment to the psychological sphere;\\nbut two illustrations may perhaps be permitted: one from\\nthe realm of sensation, showing how it has enabled us to\\nanalyze states of consciousness which were otherwise°inde-composable\\nindecomposable; and the other from that of perception, showing\\nhow it has revealed processes which could be reached\\nthrough no introspective method.\\nIt is now well known that no sensation as it exists in\\nconsciousness is simple or ultimate. Every color sensation,\\nfor example, is made up by at least three fundamental°sen-sory\\nsensory quales, probably those of red, green, and violet; while\\nthere is every reason to suppose that each of these qualities,\\nfar from being simple, is compounded of an indefinite°num-ber\\nnumber of homogeneous units. Thus the simplest musical°sensa-tion\\nsensation has also been experimentally proved to be in reality not\\nsimple, but doubly compound. First, there is the number of\\nqualitatively like units constituting it which occasion the\\npitch of the note, according to the relations of time in which\\nthey stand to each other; and second, there is the relation\\nwhich one order of these units bears to other secondary\\norders, which gives rise to the peculiar timbre or tone-color\\nof the sound; while in a succession of notes these relations\\nare still further complicated by those which produce melody\\nand harmony. And all this complexity occurs, be it°remem-bered\\nremembered, in a state of consciousness which, to introspection, is\\nhomogeneous and ultimate. In these respects physiology has\\nbeen to psychology what the microscope is to biology, or\\nanalysis to chemistry. But the experimental method has done\\nmore than reveal hidden parts, or analyze into simpler°ele-ments\\nelements. It has aided explanation, as well as observation, by\\nshowing the processes which condition a psychical event.\\nThis is nowhere better illustrated than in visual perception.\\nIt is already almost a commonplace of knowledge that, for\\nexample, the most complex landscape which we can have\\nbefore our eyes, is, psychologically speaking, not a simple\\nultimate fact, nor an impression stamped upon us from\\nwithout, but is built up from color and muscular sensations,\\n\\n ― 55 ―\\n                            \\nwith, perhaps, unlocalized feelings of extension, by means of\\nthe psychical laws of interest, attention, and interpretation.\\nIt is, in short, a complex judgment involving within itself\\nemotional, volitional, and intellectual elements. The°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of the nature of these elements, and of the laws which\\ngovern their combination into the complex visual scene, we\\nowe to physiological psychology, through the new means of\\nresearch with which it has endowed us. The importance of\\nsuch a discovery can hardly be overestimated. In fact, this\\ndoctrine that our perceptions are not immediate facts, but\\nare mediated psychical processes, has been called by°Helm-holtz\\nHelmholtz the most important psychological result yet reached.\\nBut besides the debt we owe Physiology for the method\\nof experiment, is that which is due her for an indirect means\\nof investigation which she has put within our hands; and it is\\nthis aspect of the case which has led, probably, to such°mis-conceptions\\nmisconceptions of the relations of the two sciences as exist. For\\nwhile no direct conclusions regarding the nature of mental\\nactivities or their causes can be drawn from the character of\\nnervous structure or function, it is possible to reason°indi-rectly\\nindirectly from one to the other, to draw analogies and seek\\nconfirmation. That is to say, if a certain nervous°arrange-ment\\narrangement can be made out to exist, there is always a strong\\npresumption that there is a psychical process corresponding\\nto it; or if the connection between two physiological nerve\\nprocesses can be shown to be of a certain nature, one may\\nsurmise that the relation between corresponding psychical\\nactivities is somewhat analogous. In this way, by purely\\nphysiological discoveries, the mind may be led to suspect the\\nexistence of some mental activity hitherto overlooked, and\\nattention directed to its workings, or light may be thrown on\\npoints hitherto obscure. Thus it was, no doubt, the°physio-logical\\nphysiological discovery of the time occupied in transmission of a\\nnervous impulse that led the German psychologists to their\\nepoch-making investigations regarding the time occupied in\\nvarious mental activities; thus, too, the present°psychologi-cal\\npsychological theories regarding the relation of the intellectual and\\nvolitional tracts of minds were undoubtedly suggested and\\nlargely developed in analogy with Bell\\'s discovery of the\\ndistinct nature of the sensory and motor nerves. Again, the\\n\\n ― 56 ―\\n                            \\npresent theory that memory is not a chamber hall for storing\\nup ideas and their traces or relics, but is lines of activity\\nalong which the mind habitually works, was certainly°sug-gested\\nsuggested from the growing physiological belief that the brain\\ncells which form the physical basis of memory do not in any\\nway store up past impressions or their traces, but have, by\\nthese impressions, their structure so modified as to give rise\\nto a certain functional mode of activity. Thus many°impor-tant\\nimportant generalizations might be mentioned which were°sug-gested\\nsuggested and developed in analogy with physiological\\ndiscoveries.\\nThe influence of biological science in general upon\\npsychology has been very great. Every important°develop-ment\\ndevelopment in science contributes to the popular consciousness,\\nand indeed to philosophy, some new conception which serves\\nfor a time as a most valuable category of classification and\\nexplanation. To biology is due the conception of organism.\\nTraces of the notion are found long before the great rise of\\nbiological science, and, in particular, Kant has given a°com-plete\\ncomplete and careful exposition of it; but the great rôle which\\nthe \"organic\" conception has played of late is doubtless due\\nin largest measure to the growth of biology. In psychology\\nthis conception has led to the recognition of mental life as an\\norganic unitary process developing according to the laws of\\nall life, and not a theatre for the exhibition of independent\\nautonomous faculties, or a rendezvous in which isolated,\\natomic sensations and ideas may gather, hold external°con-verse\\nconverse, and then forever part. Along with this recognition of\\nthe solidarity of mental life has come that of the relation in\\nwhich it stands to other lives organized in society. The idea\\nof environment is a necessity to the idea of organism, and\\nwith the conception of environment comes the impossibility\\nof considering psychical life as an individual, isolated thing\\ndeveloping in a vacuum.\\nThis idea of the organic relation of the individual to\\nthat organized social life into which he is born, from which\\nhe draws his mental and spiritual sustenance, and in which\\nhe must perform his proper function or become a mental and\\nmoral wreck, forms the transition to the other great°influ-ence\\ninfluence which I find to have been at work in developing the\\nNew Psychology. I refer to the growth of those vast and as\\n\\n ― 57 ―\\n                            \\nyet undefined topics of inquiry which may be vaguely°desig-nated\\ndesignated as the social and historical sciences,—the sciences of\\nthe origin and development of the various spheres of man\\'s\\nactivity. With the development of these sciences has come\\nthe general feeling that the scope of psychology has been\\ncabined and cramped till it has lost all real vitality, and\\nthere is now the recognition of the fact that all these sciences\\npossess their psychological sides, present psychological°ma-terial\\nmaterial, and demand treatment and explanation at the hands\\nof psychology. Thus the material for the latter, as well as its\\nscope, have been indefinitely extended. Take the matter of\\nlanguage. What a wealth of material and of problems it\\noffers. How did it originate; was it contemporaneous with\\nthat of thought, or did it succeed it; how have they acted and\\nreacted upon each other; what psychological laws have been\\nat the basis of the development and differentiation of°lan-guages\\nlanguages, of the development of their structure and syntax, of\\nthe meaning of words, of all the rhetorical devices of°lan-guage\\nlanguage. Any one at all acquainted with modern discussions of\\nlanguage will recognize at a glance that the psychological\\npresentation and discussion of such problems is almost\\nenough of itself to revolutionize the old method of treating\\npsychology. In the languages themselves, moreover, we\\nhave a mine of resources, which, as a record of the°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of intelligence, can be compared only to the°impor-tance\\nimportance of the paleontological record to the student of animal\\nand vegetable life.\\nBut this is only one aspect, and not comparatively a\\nlarge one, of the whole field. Folk-lore and primitive culture,\\nethnology and anthropology, all render their contributions of\\nmatter, and press upon us the necessity of explanation. The\\norigin and development of myth, with all which it includes,\\nthe relation to the nationality, to language, to ethical ideas,\\nto social customs, to government and the state, is itself a\\npsychological field wider than any known to the previous\\ncentury. Closely connected with this is the growth of ethical\\nideas, their relations to the consciousness and activities of\\nthe nation in which they originate, to practical morality, and\\nto art. Thus I could go through the various spheres of\\nhuman activity, and point out how thoroughly they are\\npermeated with psychological questions and material. But it\\n\\n ― 58 ―\\n                            \\nsuffices to say that history in its broadest aspect is itself a\\npsychological problem, offering the richest resources of\\nmatter.\\nClosely connected with this, and also influential in the\\ndevelopment of the New Psychology, is that movement\\nwhich may be described as the commonest thoughts of every-\\nday life in all its forms, whether normal or abnormal. The\\ncradle and the asylum are becoming the laboratory of the\\npsychologist of the latter half of the nineteenth century. The\\nstudy of children\\'s minds, the discovery of their actual\\nthoughts and feelings from babyhood up, the order and\\nnature of the development of their mental life and the laws\\ngoverning it, promises to be a mine of greatest value. When\\nit was recognized that insanities are neither supernatural\\ninterruptions nor utterly inexplicable \"visitations,\" it°gradu-ally\\ngradually became evident that they were but exaggerations of\\ncertain of the normal workings of the mind, or lack of\\nproper harmony and co-ordination among these workings;\\nand thus another department of inquiries, of psychical°ex-periments\\nexperiments performed by nature, was opened to us, which has\\nalready yielded valuable results. Even the prison and the\\npenitentiary have made their contributions.\\nIf there be any need of generalizing the foregoing, we\\nmay say that the development of the New Psychology has\\nbeen due to the growth, on the one hand, of the science of\\nphysiology, giving us the method of experiment, and, on the\\nother, of the sciences of humanity in general, giving us the\\nmethod of objective observation, both of which indefinitely\\nsupplement and correct the old method of subjective\\nintrospection.\\nSo much for the occasioning causes and method of the\\nNew Psychology. Are its results asked for? It will be°gath-ered\\ngathered, from what has already been said, that its results cannot\\nbe put down in black and white like those of a mathematical\\ntheory. It is a movement, no system. But as a movement it\\nhas certain general features.\\nThe chief characteristic distinguishing it from the old\\npsychology is undoubtedly the rejection of a formal logic as\\nits model and test. The old psychologists almost without\\nexception held to a nominalistic logic. This of itself were a\\nmatter of no great importance, were it not for the inevitable\\n\\n ― 59 ―\\n                            \\ntendency and attempt to make living concrete facts of°expe-rience\\nexperience square with the supposed norms of an abstract,°life-less\\nlifeless thought, and to interpret them in accordance with its\\nformal conceptions. This tendency has nowhere been\\nstronger than in those who proclaimed that \"experience\"\\nwas the sole source of all knowledge. They emasculated\\nexperience till their logical conceptions could deal with it;\\nthey sheared it down till it would fit their logical boxes; they\\npruned it till it presented a trimmed tameness which would\\nshock none of their laws; they preyed upon its vitality till it\\nwould go into the coffin of their abstractions. And neither\\nso-called \"school\" was free from this tendency. The two\\nlegacies of fundamental principles which Hume left, were:\\nthat every distinct idea is a separate existence, and that\\nevery idea must be definitely determined in quantity and\\nquality. By the first he destroyed all relation but accident; by\\nthe second he denied all universality. But these principles\\nare framed after purely logical models; they are rather the\\nabstract logical principles of difference and identity, of A is\\nA and A is not B, put in the guise of a psychological°expres-sion\\nexpression. And the logic of concrete experience, of growth and\\ndevelopment, repudiates such abstractions. The logic of life\\ntranscends the logic of nominalistic thought. The reaction\\nagainst Hume fell back on certain ultimate, indecomposable,\\nnecessary first truths immediately known through some\\nmysterious simple faculty of the mind. Here again the°logi-cal\\nlogical model manifests itself. Such intuitions are not°psycholog-ical\\npsychological; they are conceptions bodily imported from the logical\\nsphere. Their origin, tests, and character are all logical. But\\nthe New Psychology would not have necessary truths about\\nprinciples; it would have the touch of reality in the life of the\\nsoul. It rejects the formalistic intuitionalism for one which\\nhas been well termed dynamic. It believes that truth, that\\nreality, not necessary beliefs about reality, is given in the\\nliving experience of the soul\\'s development.\\nExperience is realistic, not abstract. Psychical life is\\nthe fullest, deepest, and richest manifestation of this°experi-ence\\nexperience. The New Psychology is content to get its logic from\\nthis experience, and not do violence to the sanctity and\\nintegrity of the latter by forcing it to conform to certain\\npreconceived abstract ideas. It wants the logic of fact, of\\n\\n ― 60 ―\\n                            \\nprocess, of life. It has within its departments of knowledge\\nno psycho-statics, for it can nowhere find spiritual life at\\nrest. For this reason, it abandons all legal fiction of logical\\nand mathematical analogies and rules; and is willing to\\nthrow itself upon experience, believing that the mother\\nwhich has borne it will not betray it. But it makes no\\nattempts to dictate to this experience, and tell it what it must\\nbe in order to square with a scholastic logic. Thus the New\\nPsychology bears the realistic stamp of contact with life.\\nFrom this general characteristic result most of its°fea-tures\\nfeatures. It has already been noticed that it insists upon the\\nunity and solidarity of psychical life against abstract°the-ories\\ntheories which would break it up into atomic elements or°inde-pendent\\nindependent powers. It lays large stress upon the will; not as an\\nabstract power of unmotivated choice, nor as an executive\\npower to obey the behests of the understanding, the°legisla-tive\\nlegislative branch of the psychical government, but as a living\\nbond connecting and conditioning all mental activity. It\\nemphasizes the teleological element, not in any mechanical\\nor external sense, but regarding life as an organism in which\\nimmanent ideas or purposes are realizing themselves\\nthrough the development of experience. Thus modern°psy-chology\\npsychology is intensely ethical in its tendencies. As it refuses to\\nhypostatize abstractions into self-subsistent individuals, and\\nas it insists upon the automatic spontaneous elements in\\nman\\'s life, it is making possible for the first time an°ade-quate\\nadequate psychology of man\\'s religious nature and experience.\\nAs it goes into the depths of man\\'s nature it finds, as stone of\\nits foundation, blood of its life, the instinctive tendencies of\\ndevotion, sacrifice, faith, and idealism which are the eternal\\nsubstructure of all the struggles of the nations upon the altar\\nstairs which slope up to God. It finds no insuperable°prob-lems\\nproblems in the relations of faith and reason, for it can discover\\nin its investigations no reason which is not based upon faith,\\nand no faith which is not rational in its origin and tendency.\\nBut to attempt to give any detailed account of these features\\nof the New Psychology would be to go over much of the\\nrecent discussions of ethics and theology. We can conclude\\nonly by saying that, following the logic of life, it attempts to\\ncomprehend life.\\n\\n ― 61 ―\\n                            \\nThe Obligation to Knowledge of God [First published in the Monthly Bulletin, Students\\' Christian\\nAssociation, University of Michigan, VI (Nov. 1884), 23-25. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe scriptures are uniform in their treatment of scepticism.\\nThere is an obligation to know God, and to fail to meet this\\nobligation is not to err intellectually, but to sin morally.\\nBelief is not a privilege, but a duty,-\"whatsoever is not of\\nfaith is sin.\" To a generation like ours this is a hard saying.\\nWe treat sceptics not as those who have failed to meet a\\nduty, but as unfortunates whose peculiar mental constitution\\nis depriving them of the blessings of God\\'s presence. Many\\nsceptics declare that their greatest sorrow is that they live as\\norphans in an orphaned world, without the Divine Father,\\nand that their greatest joy would be the knowledge of Him.\\nBut the statements of Christ and his immediate followers are\\nexplicit. To fail to get knowledge in these matters is not an\\nintellectual, but a moral defect.\\nAnd there are reasons for believing that there is a\\ndeeper and more adequate knowledge of man in these°state-ments\\nstatements than in our modern view. The modern view results\\nfrom a false theory of the origin, and of the nature of\\nknowledge. We have separated it from will. We have°iso-lated\\nisolated truth from duty. We have forgotten that every fact\\nknown demands something of us; we have forgotten that\\nthere is no knowledge except as our desires, our interests, our\\npurposes, in short, the whole bent of our moral nature is\\nconcerned. It is then two facts: that knowledge does not\\nbecome real knowledge until the commands which it lays\\nupon the will have been executed, and that knowledge°can-not\\ncannot arise except as our feelings and desires are involved that\\n\\n ― 62 ―\\n                            \\nenable us to grasp the Biblical statements as sober facts,\\nhard as they seem.\\nThere has never been a time when the accumulation of\\nfacts was regarded so universally as an end in itself as at\\npresent. It is also said that there was never a time when\\nscepticism was so prevalent as now. These statements are\\nrelated as cause and effect. Thousands are spending their\\ntime and their strength in investigating the minutest facts of\\nnature and of history. And this is well; but it is not so well\\nthat this leads to the shutting out of all beyond, simply\\nbecause we are contented with this. These facts are not yet\\nknowledge, until they have been brought into relation with\\nthe whole nature of man, or with his activities, social and\\nmoral. A purely intellectual life is an unhealthy, one-sided\\nlife. The evangelist, ignorant though he be, who is in°con-stant\\nconstant contact with the needs, the sins, the desires and the\\naspirations of actual human nature is a better judge of\\nreligious truth, than the man of science, if a truly°specula-tive\\nspeculative life has shut him off from sympathy and living intimacy\\nwith the fundamental truths of the common nature of man.\\nAll knowledge is one. It is all of God, the universe, say\\nrather, of God; and if any set of facts are regarded as\\nsomething in themselves, out of all relation to God and\\nGod\\'s creatures, it is no knowledge. The whole world of\\nnature and history is worthless except as it is brought into\\nrelation with man\\'s nature and activities; and that science or\\nphilosophy is worthless which does not ultimately bring\\nevery fact into guiding relation with the living activity of\\nman, and the end of all his striving-approach to God. He\\nthat does the Will, alone has real knowledge.\\nThe other error is that we have considered knowledge\\nin its origin as a faculty apart, separate from our will and\\nour desires. But the fact is that there is no knowledge of\\nanything except as our interests are alive to the matter, and\\nour will actively directed toward the end desired. We know\\nonly what we most want to know. To know or not to know is\\nnot a colorless intellectual thing, involving no part of man\\'s\\nmoral nature. It is an essentially moral thing. We must seek\\nin order to find, and we find that for which we seek. If the\\ndesires and will of man are for God, he will find God in all\\n\\n ― 63 ―\\n                            \\nhis knowledge. If there is not this attitude, man\\'s°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, though it extend never so far, will never reach unto\\nGod. He has been shut out from the start. The man whose\\ninterest in the world is not great enough to lead him to open\\nhis eyes will never see light. The man whose interest in the\\nthings of God is not great enough to lead him to direct his\\neyes to the things of God, will never see the light of the\\nworld. Man\\'s knowledge or his lack of it depends wholly\\nupon this original attitude of his will and desires toward\\nGod; and because these are under his control, because these\\nexpress his moral tendency, his knowledge does also. God is\\neverlastingly about us, and to fail to know Him is to show\\nthat we do not wish to know Him.\\n\\n ― 64 ―\\n                            \\nEducation and the Health of Women [First published in Science, VI (16 Oct. 1885), 341-42. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe tendency to apply the exact methods of science to°prob-lems\\nproblems of education, is one of the most hopeful signs of present\\npedagogy. One of the more fruitful lines of application will\\nbe found, doubtless, in the consideration of educational°ques-tions\\nquestions in relation to the wider sphere of social science, and the\\napplication of the statistical method. As one of the first fruits\\nof this application, we hail the returns collected by the\\nAssociation of Collegiate Alumnæ, wisely embodied in the\\ncurrent report of the Massachusetts Labor Bureau. These\\nare directed especially to ascertaining the effect of education\\nupon the health of women, but there are incidentally°dis-cussed\\ndiscussed a number of other very interesting problems. The\\nreturns include 12 institutions, which had (1882) graduated\\n1,290 women, from 705 or 54.65 per cent of whom returns\\nhave been received. Of these the average age at beginning\\nstudy was 5.6 years; at beginning of menstrual period, 13.6\\nyears; at entering college, 18.3 years; and at the present\\ntime, 28.5 years. This gives about six years as the average\\ntime since graduation, certainly ample for the determination\\nof the general effects upon health of their collegiate training.\\nOf the 705, 19.5 per cent report a deterioration in health\\nduring college life; 59.3 per cent, no change; 21.1 per cent,\\nan improvement. The corresponding figures for working\\ngirls of Boston show a deterioration of 16 per cent, a°favor-able\\nfavorable balance of 3.5 per cent in favor of the working girls.\\nThe total number of disorders reported by the 705 is 868.\\nThe ætiology of disease, as reported, is exceedingly°defec-tive\\n ― 65 ―\\n                            \\ndefective, but we give it for what it is worth. 135 consider°consti-tutional\\nconstitutional weakness cause of disorders; 81 bad sanitary°condi-tions\\nconditions; 81 intellectual overwork; 73 emotional strain, and 47\\nphysical accident, while the others report no cause.°Defec-tive\\nDefective as this report is in detail, it is remarkably suggestive.\\nThe general conclusion stated in the report is that the health\\nof women engaged in the pursuit of a college education, does\\nnot suffer more than that of a corresponding number of\\nother women in other occupations, or without occupation.\\nThis general conclusion may be allowed to stand. But\\nthe figures are not \"worked for all they are worth.\" A more\\ndetailed examination of them brings out the following points\\nwhich the report fails to explicitly notice.\\nOf those who entered college one or two years after the\\ncommencement of the menstrual function 20.5 per cent had\\npoor health during the four years of college life, while of\\nthose entering three to five years after its establishment 17.7\\nper cent, and more than five years 15.4 per cent had poor\\nhealth. The following figures tell the same story with slight\\nvariation: of those who entered at the age of sixteen, or\\nunder, 28.1 per cent deteriorated, 17.2 per cent improved in\\nhealth; of those seventeen to nineteen 17.3 per cent°deterio-rated\\ndeteriorated and 19.7 per cent improved; while of those who were\\ntwenty or over 17.9 per cent deteriorated, while 28.4 per cent\\nimproved—almost exactly reversing the figures for the\\nyoungest class. The fact that of the married 37 per cent are\\nwithout children, although the average number of years\\nspent in married life is 6.2, must be included in any°discus-sion\\ndiscussion that wishes to reach complete results. There were,\\nmoreover, to those bearing children but an average of two\\nchildren to every seven years of married life, while, if all\\nmarried couples are included, the average falls to 1.2°chil-dren\\nchildren for five years. With such statistics, however, there\\nmust be borne in mind the general falling off in fertility of\\nall women occupying about the same social rank. Of the\\nchildren born, 12 per cent have died, and of these the°unu-sually\\nunusually large per cent of 25 is due to causes occurring°contem-porary\\ncontemporary with birth, still, premature birth, etc.\\nThe following figures fall into the same category.°Dur-ing\\nDuring the period of development 53 per cent were troubled\\n\\n ― 66 ―\\n                            \\nduring the menstrual period with disorders, including°irreg-ularities\\nirregularities, uterine and reflex pain, one, two, or all three.\\nDuring college life the per cent was 66; since graduation 64.\\nIf mere irregularities be isolated, and they and the more\\norganic disturbances treated separately we find:°Irregulari-ties\\nIrregularities alone-development, 16 per cent; college life, 9 per cent;\\ngraduate life, 7 per cent. Uterine and reflex°pain—develop-ment\\npain—development 24 per cent; college life, 36 per cent; graduate life, 36\\nper cent. Of the disorders reported 7 per cent are brain\\ntroubles, 33 per cent nervousness, in addition to which 15\\nper cent report neuralgia; 26 per cent disorders of generative\\norgans.\\nWe give only figures, and these only such as bear\\ndirectly upon the central question of the health of woman in\\nreference to her education. They certainly show that the\\ntime for optimistic congratulations is not yet reached.\\nThe other general conclusion of the report that such\\nfalling off in health during college life, as did appear, is due\\nrather to predisposing causes, than directly attributable to\\ncollege life itself, brings out some very interesting°contribu-tions\\ncontributions to the scanty generalizations we already possess,°con-cerning\\nconcerning the relations between health and social environment.\\nFirst as to heredity: A total of 35 per cent report a tendency\\nto disease inherited from one or both parents. Those°inherit-ing\\ninheriting tendency from one parent only present some slight°fall-ing\\nfalling off in good health when compared with the entire°aver-age\\naverage; while for those inheriting from both 58.3 per cent are in\\ngood health; 41.7 in poor, the average for all being 83 and 17\\nper cent respectively. For the 65 per cent inheriting°tenden-cies\\ntendencies from neither the figures are 85 and 15. As to relative\\nchange there is for those inheriting from both a relative\\ndecrease of 19.5 per cent in those having excellent health; an\\nincrease of 24.6 per cent in those having poor; the°corre-sponding\\ncorresponding figures for those inheriting from neither being an\\nincrease in good health of 2.6 per cent, a decrease of poor of\\n1.6. The following tables show the effects of exercise, worry\\nand study upon health:\\n\\n ― 67 ―\\n                            \\nI.

For the\\nsocial student, however, it presents certain notable°deficien-cies\\ndeficiencies. The physical, social and moral environment of the\\nstudents during college requires infinitely more°investiga-tion\\ninvestigation. The details concerning intellectual surroundings are\\n\\n ― 68 ―\\n                            \\ncomparatively full, though the number of hours of study\\nshould be given instead of the indefinite terms, \"moderate,\"\\n\"severe.\" The inquiries concerning social surroundings are\\nvirtually confined to the inquiry as to whether the person\\n\"entered society,\" a little, a good deal, or none. Such vague\\nexpressions are worse than none. The question is as to how\\nthe student spent the hours of social recreation, and how\\nmany were so spent. The complete answer of this question,\\nit is hardly too much to say, would throw more light on the\\nhygienic problem than almost all else. It should include\\ninformation as to whether the institution is female only or\\nco-educational; what its social relations are to the town in\\nwhich it is situated, the nature of the town; whether the\\nyoung women live in dormitories, in cottages, in selected\\nhomes, or in ordinary boarding-houses; what regulations, if\\nany, the faculty have made concerning study hours, and the\\nhours not spent in study; whether the institution has a°ma-tron\\nmatron; whether her duties extend to moral and social matters,\\nor to physical only; whether the institution has a°gymna-sium\\ngymnasium, etc. Complete answers to such a protocol of questions\\nas these suggest would show what was meant by saying that\\n81 regard bad sanitary conditions as cause of their diseases,\\n135, constitutional weakness, and 73, emotional strain. If the\\nassociation will study the conditions of the problem along\\nthis line, and frame questions accordingly, they will deserve\\nstill more at the hands of both the scientific educator, and\\nthe social student. Meanwhile we will be thankful for what\\nwe have.\\n\\n ― 69 ―\\n                            \\nHealth and Sex in Higher Education [First published in Popular Science Monthly, XXVIII (Mar. 1886),\\n606-14. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nIt may not generally be known that the alumnæ of the more\\nimportant centers of female higher education in this country\\nhave an organized intercollegiate association for the°promo-tion\\npromotion of woman\\'s education and the study of questions°re-garding\\nregarding her training. This association has justified its°exist-ence\\nexistence, if justification were necessary, by the inquiries which\\nit has made regarding the health of those women who have\\npursued college courses. The importance of the results thus\\nobtained has led to their incorporation in the ^ current report\\nof the Massachusetts Labor Bureau. For the first time the\\ndiscussion is taken from the a priori realm of theory on the\\none hand, and the hap-hazard estimate of physician and\\ncollege instructor on the other. The returns have the value of\\nall good statistics: they not only enable us to come to some\\nconclusion upon the main point discussed, but they are so\\nfull and varied that they suggest and mark the way toward\\nthe discussion of a large number of other hardly less°impor-tant\\nimportant questions. The figures, in short, call up as many°prob-lems\\nproblems as they settle, thus fulfilling the first requisite of°fruit-ful\\nfruitful research.\\nPursuing this line, we shall first state the general°char-acter\\ncharacter of the investigation followed and conclusions reached;\\nand, secondly, isolate a few special problems for more°de-tailed\\ndetailed though brief treatment. The result may be summed\\nup in the words of the report, as follows: \"The female\\ngraduates of our colleges and universities do not seem to\\nshow, as the result of their college studies and duties, any\\n\\n ― 70 ―\\n                            \\nmarked difference in general health from the average health\\nlikely to be reported by an equal number of women engaged\\nin other kinds of work. It is true that there has been, and it\\nwas to be expected that there would be, a certain°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health on the part of some of the graduates. On the\\nother hand, an almost identical improvement in health for a\\nlike number was reported, showing very plainly that we\\nmust look elsewhere for the causes of the greater part of this\\ndecline in health during college-life. If we attempt to trace\\nthe cause, we find that this deterioration is largely due, not\\nto the requirements of college-life particularly, but to°predis-posing\\npredisposing causes natural to the graduates themselves, born in\\nthem, as it were, and for which college-life or study should\\nnot be made responsible.\"\\nThrough some oversight the statement is made that the\\nreturns include statistics from every higher institution in the\\nUnited States open to women; while, as a matter of fact, it\\nincludes a not comparatively large number. The institutions\\nrepresented, however, are typical. The data are contained in\\nTable I.\\nFor purposes of comparison, the value of the statistics\\nis vitiated by the fact that the date of the admission of\\nwomen is not given, and this, in the cases of the°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational college, does not agree with the date of organization.\\nOther facts, which we omit, go to show that the average date\\nof admission, Oberlin being excluded, may be safely put at\\nabout 1870.\\nThe questions involved in the inquiry were exceedingly\\ncomprehensive, and may conveniently be considered under\\nthree heads, of which the first takes up the conditions of\\nchildhood, comprehending date of birth, nationality of°par-ents\\nparents, surroundings in childhood, amount of exercise received\\nbetween the ages of eight and fourteen, the age at which\\nstudy began, the age at entering college, and the age at\\ngraduation. The second section relates to individual health,\\nand comprehends physical condition; nervousness; the age at\\nbeginning of the menstrual period; the conditions attending\\nthe menstrual periods; the number of graduates reporting\\ndisorders; the number of disorders; the number reporting\\neach disorder, and the causes of disorders.\\n\\n ― 71 ―\\n                            \\nI.

Of these one of the\\nmost important compares the present health of graduates\\nwith the age at beginning study, the age at entering college,\\nthe time entering college after the menstrual period°com-menced\\ncommenced, the amount of out-of-door exercise, and hereditary\\nconditions. Another compares the health during college-life\\nwith the age at entering, the amount of study performed, the\\namount of worry about private and college affairs, etc. The\\nfirst set is thus seen to be occupied with giving a picture of\\nhealth through life, while the second endeavors to ascertain\\nthe changes introduced by college-life, and their causes.\\nThe general features of the tables may be stated as\\nfollows [in Table II].\\nThe influence upon health may be summed up very\\ngenerally as follows: The maximum per cent of good health,\\n78.1, is reported at the time of entering college; during\\n\\n ― 72 ―\\n                            \\ncollege-life this falls off to 74.9 per cent, to be followed by a\\nrise to 77.9 per cent since graduation; fair health shows a\\ngain from 2 to 8 per cent during college-life, followed by a\\ndecrease to 5 per cent since that time; while there was an\\nactual decrease of 2 per cent during college-life of those\\nhaving poor health, the figures being respectively 19.8 and\\n17.3 per cent, no appreciable change being shown for the\\nyears since graduation.\\nII.

This result may be compared with\\nthe returns of the inquiries instituted by the Massachusetts\\nBoard among the working-girls of Boston, as follows: Of\\nthe 705 female college graduates, 138, or 19.58 per cent,\\nshow a deterioration in health during college-life, and of the\\n1,032 working-girls, 166, or 16.09 per cent, show a°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health, during working-time, these figures indicating\\na greater loss of health, of 3.49 per cent, reported by the\\ncollege graduates. For the 166 working-girls, whose health\\ndeteriorated, four had quite good health at the time of the\\ninvestigation, 128 were in fair health, and 34 in poor health.\\n\\n ― 73 ―\\n                            \\nOf the 138 college graduates whose health deteriorated,\\nhowever, 42 report a decline in health from excellent to\\ngood, or a slight change only. Making allowances for this,\\nthere is a greater loss of health of 2.47 per cent reported by\\nthe working-girls of Boston.\\nOf the 705 reporting, 417, or 59 per cent, mention some\\ndisorder, and the total number of disorders reported is 868.\\nThe returns regarding the causation of disease, while not\\ntechnical nor detailed enough for scientific value, are\\nsuggestive.\\nOf the 417 reporting disorders, 276 give the cause or\\ncauses of disorders, and for 141 no cause is reported. One\\nhundred and thirty-five consider constitutional weakness to\\nhave been the cause of disorder; 81, bad sanitary conditions;\\n81, intellectual overwork; 73, emotional strain; and 47,°phys-ical\\nphysical accidents.\\nThe average amount of exercise reported, considering\\nthe aversion of American women, especially the educated, to\\nbodily exertion, may be considered fairly encouraging. The\\naverage distance walked per day is given at 2.5 miles, and\\nthe time spent in other exercise as 1.2 hour. Returns°regard-ing\\nregarding the amount of college-study done by college-women\\nwould gain in interest if they could be put side by side with\\ncorresponding returns from their male companions: 4, or\\n0.57 per cent, studied but little while at college; 438, or 62.13\\nper cent, studied moderately; 64, or 9.08 per cent, between\\nmoderately and severely, and 199, or 28.22 per cent,\\nseverely.\\nEither the lazy students failed to report, or college-\\nwomen have much to learn from the average male°under-graduate\\nundergraduate about the science of laziness. The lonely four, who\\nhave the courage of their disposition, all come from one\\ncollege, which it would be ungallant to specify. Statistics\\nconcerning worry show that the art of taking things easy is\\nnot yet mastered by our ambitious young women: 172, or\\n24.40 per cent, worried over their studies; 89, or 12.62 per\\ncent, over personal affairs; 131, or 18.58 per cent, worried\\nover both studies and affairs; while 313, or 44.40 per cent,\\nworried over neither studies nor affairs.\\nThese returns for the most part tell their own tale and\\n\\n ― 74 ―\\n                            \\npoint their own moral. They certainly bear out the°conclu-sion\\nconclusion drawn regarding the uninjurious effect of collegiate\\nstudy. Their great defect is in their failure to show more\\ndefinitely the conditions and surroundings of college-life.\\nThe physical, social, and moral environment should be°care-fully\\ncarefully studied. It has long been a commonplace of vital°sci-ence\\nscience that intellectual pursuits for men per se are healthy.\\nThe question which needs solution is, What conditions°pre-vent\\nprevent their being equally healthy for women, the exact part\\nplayed by each factor, and how far it is removable? What\\nparents as well as professional educators and college°admin-istrators\\nadministrators wish to know is, what colleges have gymnasiums,\\nand whether the exercise is compulsory; how many°institu-tions\\ninstitutions have matrons, and how far their influence extends; how\\nmany have resident physicians. Do the young women live\\nherded in halls, sheltered in cottages, or at home and at\\nboarding-houses as convenience dictates? The number of\\nhours of sleep taken should be exactly stated. The number of\\nhours of study should be given, instead of the vague terms\\n\"moderate,\" etc. Instead of indefinite inquiries as to\\nwhether the student went into society much or little, exact\\ninquiries into the various modes of spending the hours of\\nsocial recreation should be made. These and many similar\\npoints, which would suggest themselves at once, may be\\nconsidered trivial; but, if we accept the general conclusion of\\nthe report that the pursuit of collegiate education is not in\\nitself harmful, the importance of studying the entire°envi-ronment\\nenvironment, physical and social, of the young student at once\\nappears. Here, in fact, the problem of her education\\ncenters.\\nTurning from the general conclusion to the°considera-tion\\nconsideration of certain specific problems, we educe the following\\ndata for discussion:\\nBy all odds the most important fact regarding the\\nhigher education of woman is, that we are educating wives\\nand mothers. Few probably will regret this, but those few\\nmust still admit the fact in a society constituted like ours.\\nThis, then, is the heart of the situation, and, in view of it,\\nthe following statistics are suggestive:\\nOmitting Oberlin College, for reasons already given,\\n\\n ― 75 ―\\n                            \\n26 per cent of the graduates who report are married, the\\nother 74 per cent single. The average number of years since\\ngraduation is, however, over six, and average age over\\ntwenty-seven. Of the married, 37 per cent are without°chil-dren\\nchildren, although the average number of years married is 6.2.\\nThe one hundred and nine having children report 205. Of\\nthese, 12 per cent have died, and, of these deaths, 25 per cent\\nare due to causes connected with bearing. If we include all\\nmarried couples, there is but 1.2 child to every five years of\\nmarried life; and, even if we exclude those not having borne\\nany, there are, among the remainder, two children to seven\\nyears of married life. We leave these figures, as the others,\\nto speak for themselves.\\nThat three hundred report their post-graduate°occupa-tions\\noccupations as teaching, and that one hundred and sixteen are\\nfollowing a professional life, shows a fact too easily lost\\nsight of. Collegiate courses for woman have not solved the\\nproblem of her education, but, at most, of her technical\\ntraining. It can hardly be thought desirable that 60 per cent\\nof all the young women of our country, who ought to have\\ncollegiate training, should have it only as a preparation for\\none of the professions or for teaching. The question of\\nwomen\\'s education, in any worthy sense of the term°educa-tion\\neducation, has yet to be faced. The remarkable fact that the\\ncourses for female education, as well in purely female°insti-tutions\\ninstitutions as in co-educational, run parallel with and are°mod-eled\\nmodeled after the curriculum of male colleges, is to be accounted\\nfor only on the ground that upon the whole their training is\\ndesigned for those who have to compete with men in the\\nprofessional walks of life.\\nIf we confine ourselves to the health of women, we\\nshall find that the figures hardly justify us in assuming a\\npurely optimistic attitude. The following figures speak for\\nthemselves: Of those who entered college one or two years\\nafter the commencement of the menstrual period, 20.5 per\\ncent had poor health during college-life; of those who°en-tered\\nentered three to five years after, but 17.7 per cent; and more\\nthan five years, 15.4 per cent. If we compare the ages at\\nentering college with the relative improvement or°deteriora-tion\\ndeterioration in health, we reach the same result. Of those who\\n\\n ― 76 ―\\n                            \\nentered college at sixteen years or under, 28 per cent fell off\\nin health, while 17 per cent gained. The figures for those of\\ntwenty and over show an almost exact reversal of these\\npercentages, being 18 per cent loss and 28.5 per cent gain.\\nThe problem of age is thus seen to be an exceedingly°impor-tant\\nimportant one.\\nThe fact that, of the disorders reported, 7 per cent are\\nbrain troubles, 26 per cent of reproductive organs, and 33\\nper cent nervousness (also 15 per cent of neuralgia), shows\\nthat the problem of health has yet to find its adequate\\nsolution. The following percentages tell the same story:\\nDuring the period of development, 53 per cent were troubled\\nduring the menstrual period (with simple irregularities,\\nuterine or reflex pain, one or all). During college-life the per\\ncent was 66; since graduation, 64. If we isolate simple°irreg-ularities\\nirregularities, the result is more significant still; for these show a\\nconstant decrease, while the organic troubles show as\\nmarked an increase, the figures being, respectively, for°ir-regularities\\nirregularities, 16 per cent, 9 per cent, 7 per cent; for uterine\\nand reflex pain, 24 per cent, 36 per cent, 36 per cent, for the\\nthree periods of development, college, and graduate life.\\nSuch percentages show along what line effort should be\\ndirected.\\nLeaving this question, we turn to the phenomena of\\ncollege-life, so far as regards exercise, study, and worry, in\\ntheir effects upon health. The tables here cease to have\\nreference, in their bearing, to women alone, and point a\\nmoral for all educators to heed. The importance of exercise\\nis shown by the fact that those reporting over two hours per\\nday return 84 per cent in good or fair health, while those\\nbelow two hours can show but 75 per cent. It is hardly an\\nexaggeration to say that, upon the whole, the tables show\\nthat worry is the most potent of all predisposing causes of\\ndisease. Those who had no worries of account report 92 per\\ncent in fair or good health; those worrying over both°per-sonal\\npersonal affairs and studies state that but 68 per cent of their\\nnumber were in the same condition. Worry over personal\\nmatters seems to be more harmful to health than°overstud-ies\\noverstudies, 75 and 80 per cent being the proportion of good health\\nrespectively. This showing goes far in substantiating the\\n\\n ― 77 ―\\n                            \\nopinion of those who hold that study per se is never a cause\\nof failure of health. However, of those who studied severely,\\n21 per cent report poor health, against 15 per cent of those\\nstudying moderately. Again, of the latter, 54 per cent report\\ndisorders as against 70 per cent of those who studied more;\\nthe figures for nervousness also are 15 and 26 per cent\\nrespectively. It is fair to suppose, however, that the largest\\nper cent of those worrying over their studies was found\\namong those studying severely.\\nIn the tables, the distinction is made between those\\nreporting from female colleges only and those of the°co-edu-cational\\nco-educational. It is an easy matter, however, to separate them,\\nwhich I have done, with the following results: Of the whole\\nnumber (705), 458 are from female colleges; 247°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational. For graduate life, the figures for health are exactly\\nthe same for both: 83 per cent in good health, and 17 per\\ncent in poor. During college-life 16 per cent of the°co-educa-tionalists\\nco-educationalists report poor health, as against 18 per cent of those\\nfrom female colleges; but this is more than accounted for by\\nthe fact that 22 per cent of the latter were in poor health\\nbefore entering, showing a real gain during college-life of 4\\nper cent in average health, while the reports of°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational colleges show a gain of but one per cent. It must be\\nnoticed, however, that the female colleges show a falling off\\nof 4.8 per cent from good to fair health, while the°co-educa-tional\\nco-educational show a similar loss of but 0.3 per cent. The average\\nnumber of disorders reported is much the same for each\\nclass: 1.19 for graduates of female colleges; 1.24 for the\\nother class. The figures as given show that either more care\\nis taken of personal health in the female colleges than in the\\nco-educational, or that more supervision is exercised; for 55\\nper cent of the former report abstinence from study and\\nexercise during the menstrual period, and only 25 per cent of\\nthe latter. The figures for disorders show no corresponding\\ngain, however, the advantage here being on the side of the\\nco-educational institutions, as the latter report 33 per cent of\\ndisorders of brain, nerves, and reproductive organs, against\\n41 per cent in the female colleges. The figures for worry are\\nabout the same in each class: 33 per cent report severe study\\nin the co-educational colleges, as against 26 per cent in the\\n\\n ― 78 ―\\n                            \\nother; the advantage in exercise is, however, somewhat on\\nthe side of the co-educational college. The figures in the\\ncausation of disorders show the same percentages arising\\nfrom intellectual overwork and physical accident. The°fe-male\\nfemale colleges, however, report proportionately over one\\nthird more breaking down from emotional strain, while the\\nco-educational colleges balance the account with one fourth\\nmore failing in health by reason of bad sanitary conditions.\\nOf the life since graduation, not much can be said: 23\\nper cent of the graduates of the female colleges have°mar-ried\\nmarried; 28 per cent of the co-educational, the average age of\\neach being the same. Competition with men seems to have\\nled a less number of graduates of co-educational colleges to\\nenter the professions; at all events they report but 12 per\\ncent in the professions, while the female colleges report 21\\nper cent. A somewhat larger number follow teaching,°how-ever\\nhowever, the figures here being 48 per cent and 42 per cent\\nrespectively.\\nIt would certainly be too much to say from these°fig-ures\\nfigures that the personal care and advice from others given in\\nfemale colleges are greater, while the social surroundings in\\nthe co-educational colleges are healthier, because perhaps\\nmore natural; but they suggest the advisability of questions\\ndirected to these points. The female colleges seem to have\\nthe advantage in purely sanitary conditions (except amount\\nof exercise), as witnessed by the smaller percentage°report-ing\\nreporting bad sanitation as cause of disease; by the advantage of\\nmore than two to one of abstinence from study at critical\\nperiods, and in moderation of study; while the advantage of\\nhealth remains on the side of the co-educational during\\ncollege-life. That the balance shifts after graduation would\\npoint in the line of the generalization already suggested; as\\nwith the cessation of college-life would cease the abnormal\\ncloistering of the young women, while bad sanitary°condi-tions\\nconditions would show comparatively permanent results. That\\nproportionately one third more in the female colleges report\\nemotional strain as cause of disorders, other causes showing\\nmuch the same average, points in the same direction. At any\\nrate, it is worth inquiry whether it is not possible to unite the\\npresumed advantage of the female colleges in wise advice\\n\\n ― 79 ―\\n                            \\nand proper attention to health with the freer and more\\nnatural social relations of the co-educational institutions.\\nIt is hoped that enough has been said to show the\\nimportance of the investigations already made, and to justify\\nthe supposition that further more detailed and extended\\ninquiries would increase their value. No educator at all\\nacquainted with the present status of affairs will carp at the\\nresults already reached, nor will he find much but cause for\\nthankfulness upon a survey of the field; but his outlook must\\nbe directed toward the future, not the past. Nothing could\\nwell be more fatal to the cause of woman\\'s education than to\\nsuppose that the question is already settled. The°commence-ment\\ncommencement has indeed been made, but only the commencement.\\nMere multiplication of institutions and influences of the\\nexisting type, however valuable, as affording opportunities\\nto individual young women, will do little toward°determin-ing\\ndetermining the larger aspects of the case. Were the number of\\npurely women\\'s colleges largely increased, and were all the\\nimportant boys\\' colleges to open their doors to girls, only the\\nnecessary basis for the solution of the problem would be\\nobtained.\\nSuch inquiries as we have briefly summarized can do\\nmore than aught else to furnish necessary data for a wise\\nand comparatively permanent solution. Discussion on°parti-san\\npartisan lines is absolutely valueless, and a priori discussion will\\neffect nothing. The unbiased study by educational experts of\\nthe fruits actually borne by experience is invaluable, and the\\ngeneralizations based upon such data will show the lines\\nupon which reform must work itself out. This is not the\\nplace to formulate the exact nature of such inquiries, but\\nthey should cover at least three heads:\\n1. HEALTH. The present report offers a valuable model to\\nfollow. More attention should be given to the social and\\nmoral environment of college-life, however, even in this\\npoint; and the discussion should more definitely concern the\\nspecifically female functions.\\n2. LIFE SINCE GRADUATION. The brief notes respecting\\nmarriages and occupations in the report discussed are all we\\n\\n ― 80 ―\\n                            \\nhave on this head. It should be treated with a view to\\ndetermining as accurately as may be the position which the\\ncollege-educated woman holds and desires to hold in the\\nbody social and politic. When we recollect the difficulty in\\nadjusting young men\\'s collegiate education to their life after\\ngraduation, in spite of the accumulation of infinite°experi-ence\\nexperience, the value of such a report in determining the lines\\nwhich woman\\'s college education should follow, in the\\ndearth of information upon the topic, is at once seen.\\n\\n3. SPECIFIC DATA FOR FUTURE MOVEMENTS. These\\nshould be based upon confidential revelations made by the\\ngraduates themselves, together with the testimony of college\\nofficers and physicians. It should not be limited narrowly.\\nThey should go far beyond the question of bodily health.\\nThe statement of what each had found the greatest aid and\\nthe greatest hindrance in her collegiate training would be of\\nmuch value. Experience alone can decide the exact form\\nwhich these inquiries should take, but their importance can\\nhardly be over-estimated in the moral and social aspects of\\nthe case.\\nEducation must follow the example of the special°sci-ences\\nsciences. It must organize. There is organization, and to spare,\\nin the schools themselves; what we want is organized°recog-nition\\nrecognition of the problems of education; organized study for the\\ndiscovery of methods of solution; organized application of\\nthese methods in the details of school-life. Co-operation in\\nresearch and application is the key to the problem.\\n\\n ― 81 ―\\n                            \\nPsychology in High-Schools from the Standpoint of the College [First published in Michigan School-Masters\\' Club Papers, 1886\\n(Lansing, Michigan: H. R. Pattengill, [1886]). 4 pp. Reproduced\\nin facsimile by Edwards Brothers, Ann Arbor, 1947. Notpre-viously\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nA Paper Read at the First Meeting\\nof the Michigan School-Masters\\' Club,\\nby Dr. John Dewey,\\nof the University of Michigan\\n\\nI have to confess at the outset that I have prepared this\\npaper rather because I am interested in the subject than\\nbecause I think myself to know anything about it. I am in\\nneed of information and am correspondingly glad to have\\nthe chance of exposing my ignorance. In fact, I am inclined\\nto congratulate myself on the deficiencies of my own°knowl-edge\\nknowledge, as these may be the surest method of calling out the\\nwider experience and better former judgments of others.\\nHaving made this general confession, it remains only to\\nmake it specific by adding that not only have I never taught\\npsychology in a high-school, but that I have never been as\\nstudent or as teacher in a school where it is taught. I may lay\\nclaim to the impartiality born of ignorance, and the°doctri-narianism\\ndoctrinarianism bred of the lack of practice.\\nI do not wish, however, to carry my presumption too\\nfar; and accordingly I suggest that there may be two ways\\nof looking at the educational value of my subject, since that\\nsubject has two functions; one direct and immediate, the\\nother, remote. There is, in the first place, the precise and\\naccurate training which the mind receives at the time of\\nstudy, together with the information gathered. But there is\\n\\n ― 82 ―\\n                            \\nalso that training which puts the mind in an enlarged, yes,\\nin a new attitude to all subjects with which it may thereafter\\ncome in contact, whether in the regulated discipline of°col-lege\\ncollege life, or in the more accidental and wider education of\\nlife. Of the first of these two functions I shall not attempt to\\nsay anything. The few things I shall say are upon the study\\nof psychology from the standpoint of after-life. For the sake\\nof convenience I shall put my remarks under the orthodox\\nthree heads of tradition, taking, however, no great pains to\\navoid over-lappings. First, Should psychology be taught in\\nthe high-school? Secondly, With what end in view should it\\nbe taught? Thirdly, How should it be taught?\\nTo the first question, magnifying mine office, I return a\\ndogmatic yes. Aside from the fact that if I did not my paper\\nwould have to end right here, the following considerations\\nhave weight with me. No one, I suppose, would contend that\\neducation is complete until the one educated knows°some-thing\\nsomething of that intellect which has been receiving the training;\\nof those feelings which form the springs of his action, and of\\nthe will which has been exercising itself. No teacher, I am\\nsure, would contend that this knowledge of one\\'s own nature\\nis exhausted in the study of physiology, for no teacher,\\nwhatever his theoretical views, has ever been a practical\\nmaterialist. He comes into too close contact with the living\\npersonality for that. Indeed, I have often been struck with\\nthe way in which good teachers treat almost any°psychologi-cal\\npsychological subject, a way likely to be more adequate than it receives\\nat the hands of a professed psychologist. The reason I have\\nalways conceived to be that the teacher never loses sight of\\nthe concrete mind, the personal boy or girl; he recognizes\\nthat the laws and principles of the mental philosopher are\\nabstractions, and does not allow them to make him forget\\nthe individual who is in and through them all. So I am sure\\nthat I can count upon the hearty sympathy of every teacher\\nin laying considerable emphasis upon that knowledge of self\\nwhich it is the business of psychology to give.\\nBut why should systematic instruction in this line be\\ngiven in the high-school? When the respective claims of\\nlanguages, ancient and modern, mathematics and history,\\nscience, physical and biological, are driving distracted the\\n\\n ― 83 ―\\n                            \\nmuch-enduring Ulysses, there should be hesitation in laying\\non more load. In answer I should say that this study is\\nnecessary to meet a demand which arises in the child\\'s\\nnature about this time. No matter what one\\'s views about\\nthe relations of body and soul, one knows that the average\\nboy and girl undergo a mental as well as a physical°revolu-tion\\nrevolution between the ages of say, 14 to 17 years. There comes to\\nbe at this time something like self-consciousness. In a°cer-tain\\ncertain sense, no doubt, this commences when the child calls\\nhimself I, but after all this generally means that the child\\nrecognizes himself as one object among many. His own\\npeculiar individuality he does not become conscious of until\\nhe feels his relations to others, and this he does not do until\\nhis life finds its solidarity with that of the race. We may\\noften be struck with the apparent selfishness, cruelty and\\nheedlessness of children before this period, but we err unless\\nwe remember that this is of nature, rather than conscious.\\nThe child up to this time lives a natural life, a naïve,°objec-tive\\nobjective one. With adolescence begins his subjective existence;\\nthe life which recognizes its own unique significance for\\nitself, and begins dwelling upon its personal relations,°intel-lectual\\nintellectual and moral, and experimenting with them to get them\\nadjusted in that way in which about the whole life of man\\nconsists. These are the beginnings of self-questioning; of\\nintrospection; of inquiries into the meaning of things, and of\\none\\'s relation to them. Now it is a question of the widest\\npedagogic interest, what are we to do with this change in the\\nchild\\'s nature? Shall we recognize it in any systematic way,\\nor leave it to take care of itself? I do not mean for one\\nmoment to claim that the study of psychology is the all\\nsufficient means of meeting it; but it does seem possible that\\ndirecting the inquiries of the child at this time, instead of\\nallowing them to drift, may be an immediate intellectual\\nhelp as well as save much waste of mental and even moral\\nforce. But not only is psychology needed to meet the°dawn-ing\\ndawning self-consciousness of the student, but it is needed in\\norder to balance the relations of studies. Before adolescence\\nthe pupil\\'s mind does not, in the vast majority of cases, care\\nfor connection or relation. Isolated facts are enough. The\\nchild asks why, but any other fact does for the answer. After\\n\\n ― 84 ―\\n                            \\npuberty, the isolated facts seem to shoot together. The child\\nmust have his facts threaded upon some principle. Now I\\nmust not be understood as suggesting that the study of\\npsychology is the only or even the primary means of°answer-ing\\nanswering this want. Every subject the pupil studies should be\\ntreated in such a way as to answer this demand. But is there\\nnot something to be said for the view that the child should\\nbe led to see that these studies centre in his intelligence? It is\\nof some importance, it must be of great value ultimately,\\nthat the pupil be made to know that in studying°mathemat-ics\\nmathematics he is illustrating laws of his own reason; that in pursuing\\ngeology or botany he is exercising his own perceptive\\npowers; that in history and the languages he is becoming\\nacquainted with wills and intelligences like his own.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology ought to serve rather as a bond of union among\\nstudies than as a source of new discord. At all events, when\\na youth is studying everything in the world, from yeast to\\nelephants and from bugs to Greek roots, it cannot be out of\\nplace to call his attention to the fact that he himself exists\\nand is as worthy of study as any of these things.\\nAnd this suggests in the second place with what°pur-pose\\npurpose the study of psychology should be carried on. It should\\nbe studied with a view to putting greater meaning into the\\nrest of the curriculum. I should suggest this in connection\\nespecially with the studies of grammar, rhetoric and°litera-ture\\nliterature. Grammar is an exceedingly technical study. Its°com-prehension\\ncomprehension would ultimately lead us into the ranges of°meta-physics\\nmetaphysics, to say nothing of psychology. To the beginner it too\\noften seems an arbitrary collection of meaningless rules. But\\neven an elementary knowledge of the laws of the general\\nnotion and of judgment and the reasoning powers, would\\nenable the pupil to see in grammar a reflection of his own\\nintelligence, and I can but express my conviction that there\\nis no more efficient way of verifying and rendering fruitful a\\nstudy of English literature than to undertake it in connection\\nwith the study of psychology. A student who knows°some-thing\\nsomething of the imagination and its ways of working, of\\næsthetic feeling and its modes of expression, will certainly\\ntake a more intelligent interest in Shakespeare, Tennyson\\nand Carlyle than he otherwise would. Give an intelligent\\n\\n ― 85 ―\\n                            \\nyouth of 17 or 18 a novel of George Eliot\\'s to read critically;\\nwhat will be the difference in value of result according as he\\nknows or not something of the facts of human will, and of\\nsocial and moral feeling? I feel sure that a proper study of\\npsychology is capable of transforming the reading of°litera-ture\\nliterature from a pastime with incidental revenue of instruction\\ninto a sincere, critical and fruitful appreciation of it, so far\\nas extends the range of the student.\\nIt follows from what has been said that the instruction\\nin psychology should not have a dogmatic end in view—the\\ncommunication of a system. I say this not only because of\\nthe many varying opinions on some psychological subjects,\\nbut also because, even in matters where there may be no\\ndispute, the student is not in a condition to appreciate the\\ntruth. Neither his knowledge nor the maturity of his°intel-lect\\nintellect allows him to grapple with any very systematic°proposi-tions\\npropositions. There is a two-fold error in furnishing the pupil with\\nideas, even if true, when he is not in a condition to°appre-ciate\\nappreciate their origin and bearing. In the first place the chief\\nultimate end of the study of psychology is to gain a°knowl-edge\\nknowledge of one\\'s self. This must be a gradual process, and one\\nwhich can be carried on only by the student himself. To\\npresent him at the outset with a chart of himself, formulæ,\\nlabels, nomenclatures and analysis complete, is to do away\\nwith the only object of the study. It is to commit the error of\\ndepriving the student of his primary pedagogic right in re\\npsychology. The second aspect of the mistake is that it may\\nshut off the student from learning anything new. If a student\\nis thoroughly inoculated with a system, his growth in the\\nfuture is rendered difficult. The cartilaginous portions of the\\nbrain are hardened and its sutures closed. One who has been\\nintroduced when his mind is most plastic into a system of\\nhard and fast distinctions, cannot lose their impress. All new\\nfacts he can classify and comprehend only by their°connec-tion\\nconnection with his system. When a new fact appears he does not\\nassimilate it; he takes out his rule and his pigeon-holed box;\\nmeasures the fact according to his ready-made standard, and\\ntucks it away in its appropriate place.\\nThis suggests what is perhaps the chief end of the\\nstudy of psychology-the cultivation of openness and°flexibil-ity\\n ― 86 ―\\n                            \\nflexibility of mind. If I were asked what is the chief intellectual\\ndefect found in pupils, I should answer, judging from my\\nown experience, lack of flexibility, lack of ability to turn the\\nmind towards new ideas, or look at old ones in new lights.\\nThere is a helplessness towards what lies outside of the\\nwonted grooves of thought. While it is neither to be°ex-pected\\nexpected nor desired that students should exhibit precocious\\noriginality of conception, it is desirable that their minds\\nshould be hospitable and not alien to ideas. The mind does\\nnot need to create new lines in order to be able to move upon\\nthem when suggested. It is an important pedagogic point to\\nknow what can be done to make the intelligence of the\\naverage boy and girl more flexible-that is, better able to\\nhandle on its own account lines of thought upon which it has\\nnot been exercised. How can we make the mind, not more\\nmature, but more receptive to ideas; how can we cultivate,\\nnot a higher grade of intelligence, but spontaneity of action?\\nThese are the questions. The notion that the study of°psy-chology\\npsychology will aid in answering them, is because this study\\nrequires in such large measure the self-initiating,°self-direct-ing\\nself-directing movement of mind. The student\\'s mind is at once the\\nmaterial to be observed and the observer. It furnishes as well\\nthe method of observation. The student deals, not with a\\nmaterial foreign to himself, by which he may be hampered,\\nbut with himself. He must discover the very material of his\\nstudy. Nor can rules of discovery be externally laid down for\\nhim in routine methods to which he must conform. The\\nways of getting at the material and of treating it must be left\\nto himself. The teacher\\'s function must be largely one of\\nawakening, of stimulation. The mind of the average pupil\\nwill reject this awakening if it can, and will ask anything\\nrather than to be led out of the fields of authority into\\nintellectual regions where it is itself responsible for results.\\nBut the test of the teaching will after all be the degree in\\nwhich the mind is awakened and is given ability to act for\\nitself.\\nThis does not imply that the teacher is to be a°nonen-tity\\nnonentity, or that he is to give no positive instruction, or make\\nknown to the student none of the generalizations arrived at\\nby past psychological study. It means that the student must\\n\\n ― 87 ―\\n                            \\nbe led to reproduce and realize the material in himself. It is a\\ndemand similar to that made in behalf of the experimental\\nmethod in the physical sciences. The pupil must be made to\\nsee in concrete cases what his rules, etc., mean; and in the\\ncase of psychology, these concrete cases may be suggested\\nby the teacher, but they can actually be found only by the\\nstudent himself in his own mind. The result must be that if\\npsychology is so taught it will aid largely in helping on to\\nwhat is, when all is said and done, the end of education-the\\nsecuring of intellectual freedom, in its various factors of\\nopenness of mind, hospitality to ideas, and ability to move\\namong them unconstrainedly. I feel sure that if psychology\\ncould be taught in high-schools with this end in view, fewer\\nof our students in college would be monuments of blank and\\nbland helplessness when a new idea is presented than is now\\nthe case.\\nThis introduces us to our third question, how should\\npsychology be taught? The phrase, \"if properly taught,\"\\nhas been many times used, and it is no more than fair to ask\\nwhat is proper teaching. In reply I can only say it is such\\nteaching as serves the end mentioned, and whatever other\\nends are desirable. It must be the function of the individual\\nteacher, as it is his privilege, to lay down the especial acts\\nrequired, and to make his wise adaptation of means to end.\\nYet a few suggestions will perhaps be pardoned. I have\\nheard of a high-school where the teacher merely announces\\nat the end of one hour that the subject for the next day is\\nmemory, or feeling or whatever. He does not tell the pupils\\nanything about them; he does not tell them where they can\\nfind out about them. But the next day, by skillful°question-ing\\nquestioning, he draws out such ideas as he can from the pupil\\'s own\\nconsciousness. I can well believe that with a wise teacher,\\nand small classes, this hour is one of the most looked°for-ward\\nforward to, as well as one of the most profitable of the whole\\nday. The method has at all events the sanction of Socrates,\\nthe founder of scientific psychology.\\nBut the teacher must undoubtedly be on his guard not\\nto foster undue or morbid introspection. I think that the\\nstudy of psychology rightly handled will tend to check this\\nhabit with its evil results, for it will tend to make the\\n\\n ― 88 ―\\n                            \\nstudent\\'s feelings and ideas objective to himself; yet the\\nteacher must be a wise physician of the soul to secure proper\\nresults. An aid to this, without doubt, is keeping the study in\\nas close connection as possible with literature, as previously\\nsuggested. If the same teacher has charge of both studies,\\nwhy should it be impossible to take some literary classic,\\nand read it with especial attention to its psychological°fea-tures\\nfeatures—its treatment of perception, of imagination, of°discur-sive\\ndiscursive thought, of impulses, of choice, etc.? By such a method\\nthe student not only gains some idea of the scope and subject\\nmatter of psychology, but some idea of what constitutes\\nstyle, and the proper material and arrangement of literary\\nmaterial.\\nThe difficulty of giving any cast iron rules concerning\\nmethod, psychology shares with all studies; with the°addi-tional\\nadditional difficulty—and advantage-that it is above all a°per-sonal\\npersonal study. The only first rule which it is possible to lay\\ndown is that the teacher must come into the most intimate\\nrelations with the minds of the students. Upon this condition\\ndepends in reality the answer to the other questions: Should\\npsychology be taught, and with what end should it be\\ntaught? Unless it is met there is indeed no especial end to be\\ngained by the introduction of psychology into the°curricu-lum\\ncurriculum. The student would better confine his attention to the\\nstudies which he can absorb once for all, with no teacher\\nstanding between him and the light.\\nDiscussion\\n\\nProf. W. H. Payne said: I do not wish to enter upon\\nthe discussion of this subject at this time, and I fully agree\\nwith the sentiments of the paper that a share of the public\\nschool attention should be given to the study of mental\\nphenomena. There is, however, at this time a lack of books\\nadapted to such work and a lack of teachers prepared to give\\ninstruction in the subject. Before taking my seat I wish to\\nenter my protest against the idea which is now held in\\ncertain localities, that the young mind can only be\\nstrengthened by original investigation in any subject.°Cer-tain\\nCertain things have been already learned, and a pupil\\'s mind\\n\\n ― 89 ―\\n                            \\nmay grow by a study of facts that have been given to him.\\nWe are subject to certain periodic pressures in which one\\ntopic and then another is brought into prominence. A short\\ntime since, the sciences were in the ascendant, then the\\nstudy of English bid fair to over-balance all others, and now\\nwe have \"manual training\" claiming the ascendancy. The\\ntrue course, it would seem, is to give each subject due\\nconsideration, and not in the excitement of the moment\\nallow ourselves unduly to magnify any one thing.\\nProf. Montgomery said: Psychology should be taught\\nin the high-schools because so many of our teachers are\\nprepared there. If we knew more of the study of the mind\\nthere might be less of running to extremes.\\nPresident Hull said: As we now lack any elementary\\ntext-book of this kind, would it not be well to prepare a\\npamphlet which should contain the dialogues of Plato in\\nsuch form as to lead the high-school student to begin this\\nstudy?\\n\\n ― 90 ―\\n                            \\nThe Place of Religious Emotion [First published in the Monthly Bulletin, Students\\' Christian\\nAssociation, University of Michigan, VIII (Nov. 1886), 23-25.\\nNot previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThere is, if the phrase may receive pardon, such a thing as\\nreligious hygiene. There is a certain body of considerations\\nand precepts which avail in the practical ordering of°reli-gious\\nreligious life. They will not bring righteousness and peace to a\\ndiseased soul, any more than physiological rules will heal a\\ndisordered body. But they will help to keep it healthy, and to\\nmake it grow when once it is sound. I know of nothing more\\nimportant in the practical Christian life, than the right°con-duct\\nconduct of the emotions. They are so central that when they are\\nhealthy, we may take it for granted that the whole religious\\nlife is upon the right line. There are two unhealthy°develop-ments\\ndevelopments of emotion which occur to me in the consideration of\\nthis subject. One is deadness or apathy of feeling. The other\\nis undue or unregulated stimulation. It is certain as anything\\ncan be, that without a spontaneous and active interest in\\nthings that are lovely and of good report, there will be no\\nsincere devotion, no earnest service. An outgoing and°con-stant\\nconstant renewing of religious emotion is the only motive force\\nwhich will awaken us from drowsy torpor, from listless\\ndreaming, from an empty and purposeless life. It alone can\\ncall us out of the kingdom of drudgery and routine, and\\nintroduce us to the joy of the kingdom of God. This is a\\ntruth not confined to religious action. It is co-extensive with\\nall action. Without the interest supplied by emotions, men\\nmight sleep and dream, but they would never awake and act.\\nBut mark one thing—the feeling is not a good in itself, it is\\ngood because it does arouse, because it awakens aspiration,\\nkindles devotion, and leads to service.\\nAnd this suggests the fact that, while it is all important\\n\\n ― 91 ―\\n                            \\nto have the religious emotions alive and developed, it is\\nequally important that they should be healthy. But what is\\nunhealthy religious feeling? In the words of Dr. Martineau,\\nit is \"keenly watching the spiritual weather in the mind,\\ngauging the affections, refining the temperature, describing\\nthe clouds, but spell-bound in the personal atmosphere, and\\nnever carried out into the light of lights.\" Religious feeling\\nis unhealthy when it is watched and analyzed to see if it\\nexists, if it is right, if it is growing. It is as fatal to be\\nforever observing our own religious moods and experiences,\\nas it is to pull up a seed from the ground to see if it is\\ngrowing. We must plant the seed and nourish it, and leave\\nthe rest where it belongs—to God. God, in all reverence, has\\nno special interest in or concern for our own private feelings\\nand experiences. Religious feeling, when it is thought to\\nmean collection of thoughts and sentiments about God, or of\\ntender and solemn emotions in the mind, belies itself, and is\\nno longer religious. How many of us are making religion an\\noccasion for the production and observation of spiritual\\nweather in ourselves, and even of regarding God more as a\\nmeans for affording us certain religious emotions than as a\\nperson to whom the reverence and service of our lives is\\nmost humbly due? So far as feeling is regarded simply as a\\nstate of our own selves, and is interesting to us simply as an\\nexperience, as an occasion for remorse on our deadness or\\nfor self-gratulation on our quickness, it does more than fail\\nin being religious: it is irreligious; for it keeps us shut up in\\nour poor and paltry being, while the essence of religion is\\nhumble self-surrender of our wills to the Divine will. We\\nmay flatter ourselves that we are living an advanced°Chris-tian\\nChristian life, and produce feelings of tenderness and of°aspira-tion\\naspiration, of regret and of disease as evidences of this life; and yet\\nthese feelings, rightly interpreted, may only show that we\\nare turning round and round in the paddock of our own\\nselfishness, never having lost our lives in the one perfect life.\\nIn such cases, every additional emotion, though it be called\\nreligion, is additional evidence that we have no part nor lot\\nin religion. Healthy emotion, whether religious or otherwise,\\nis that which finds no time nor opportunity to dwell upon\\nitself and see how it is getting along; which loses itself in\\n\\n ― 92 ―\\n                            \\npushing on to the work of the prize of the high calling. It is\\nemotion which expends itself in action, and which gives the\\nimpetus to new endeavor.\\nBut we must cultivate our religious emotions; and how\\nshall we do this and yet avoid the error just mentioned? By\\nthinking more of God and His will and less of ourselves; by\\nregarding religion more and our own progress in religion\\nless. If we cultivate humility in the presence of the perfect\\nand matchless character of Christ, we shall find that regret\\nand remorse for our own shortcomings will come quickly\\nenough without our going to pump them up artificially; if\\nwe cultivate reverence for that perfect and living will of God\\nas made known to us in Christ, we shall find little need and\\nless opportunity for looking after our own spiritual weather,\\nand seeing that we are enjoying the proper amount of light,\\nand experiencing the sufficient need of heat. The light which\\nis of God will shine upon us, and the heat which comes of\\ndevoted service will be ours.\\n\\n ― 93 ―\\n                            \\nSoul and Body [First published in Bibliotheca Sacra, XLIII (Apr. 1886), 239-63.\\nNot previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nLest the reader trained in a school which holds that there is\\nnothing to be said of the relations of soul and body, except\\nthat there is soul and there is body and that is the end of it,\\nshould turn away at the outset in disgust from what must\\nseem to him an attempt to solve the insoluble-let me say a\\nword or two to avoid misapprehension. Lotze has°some-where\\nsomewhere called attention to the fact that the natural tendency\\nof an historical age, priding itself on its historical sense, and\\nworking by an historical method, is to surrender the°under-standing\\nunderstanding to the imagination, and to demand pictures instead\\nof principles. We are not contented until we can see the\\nobject-matter as a series of definite images. Instead of°ex-planation\\nexplanation we want a drama before our eyes. It is because of\\nthis tendency, I believe, that it is assumed that there is some\\ndifficulty special in kind surrounding the question of the\\nrelations of soul and body which makes all attempts to\\nconsider the subject necessarily futile. It seems to be°as-sumed\\nassumed on the one hand that nothing can be said about it\\nunless we can see into the bowels of the molecules°constitut-ing\\nconstituting the brain, and behold from their mutual attractions and\\nrepulsions, a sensation and a thought engendered. Or on the\\nother hand, it is assumed that to know any thing about the\\nrelations of soul and body, we must be able to contemplate\\nthe soul, seated as on a throne in the body, thence sending\\nforth her messengers to lay hold of the nerves and cause\\nthem to bring her reports of what is going on in the outlying\\nregions of her domain, or to execute her orders among\\nrefractory subjects. And if the only way of knowing any\\nthing about their relations were some such imaginative°ex-ploit\\nexploit, the question were well called insoluble. But questions,\\n\\n ― 94 ―\\n                            \\nas science and philosophy can well testify, are more often\\ninsoluble by reason of some unnecessary and absurd°as-sumption\\nassumption, than from the inherent nature of the case. And so\\nthe failure of all attempts on this line is rather, I conceive,\\ntestimony to the absurdity of the mode of search, than to the\\nabsurdity of the question itself. We have an understanding\\nas well as an imagination; principles may be thought as well\\nas pictures seen; laws exist as well as panoramas. We may\\nwell give up the attempt to imagine the neural and psychical\\nprocesses so as to see a transition from one to another, and\\nconfine ourselves to the less picturesque, but more hopeful,\\ntask of inquiring what principles shall be employed in order\\nto render intelligible the relations of the physical and°psychi-cal\\npsychical, so far as these relations have been actually made known.\\nWe have certain facts declared by physiology and°psychol-ogy\\npsychology. The sole question is: what principles, conceptions,\\nshall we use in order to explain these facts, i.e., in order to\\nrender a consistent, intelligible account of them? To say that\\nthis cannot be done is simply to say that there are facts in\\nthe universe which are utterly irrational, which have no\\nmeaning. And the one who has the capacity of discovering\\nby his reason that certain facts are non-rational to his°rea-son\\nreason, is not the one whom I address.\\nTherefore, if it is again stated that the object of this\\npaper is to consider the relations of soul and body, I hope it\\nwill be understood that the object is not to get into the inside\\nof nature and behold with mortal eyes what is going on\\nthere, but the less ambitious one of inquiring what°princi-ples\\nprinciples must be used in order to give meaning to the facts of the\\ncase. How shall the facts of physiological psychology be\\ninterpreted?\\nWhat are these facts?\\nFirst. The nervous system, complex as it is, consists\\nultimately of fibres and cells. The fibres serve normally to\\nconduct or transfer nervous stimuli either from the organ of\\nsense to some collection of cells, or ganglion, or from this\\ncentre back to the muscles and glands, or from one such\\ncentre to another. The cells, on the other hand, receive the\\nstimuli brought to them from the surface, and react upon\\nthem in such a way as either to neutralize them from their\\nown supply of force, or so as to set free their own nervous\\n\\n ― 95 ―\\n                            \\nenergy. In short, the fibres conduct the nervous energy; the\\ncells produce it and regulate its distribution. This distinction\\nin the mode of work of the two elements exists. But it has\\nbeen usual to regard this distinction in such a way as to\\nmake of it an actual separation of functions. This introduces\\na dualism into the action of the nervous system at the start.\\nIt has been held that the fibres are purely passive and\\nreceptive, while cells are active. This leads to this result: the\\ncells alone are regarded as having psychical bearings, so\\nthat the brain is held to be the sole organ of the mind. The\\nnerves and the peripheral organs are eliminated. Some even\\ngo so far as to hold that in the brain there must be some\\nparticular set of cells to which all stimuli must be°con-ducted\\nconducted, and that this alone is the organ of the soul. We must\\navoid, at the outset, any such error. The truth is that the\\ndistinction between fibre and cell is a relative one. Fibres\\npossess an activity of their own as well as the cells, and cells\\nconduct. The fibre is not a string which, pulled at one end,\\nrings a bell at the other, itself remaining the meantime\\nindifferent to the process; it is a series of nervous elements\\neach reacting upon the stimulus of the one before it, as the\\ncell reacts to the whole, and each passing it on to the one\\nafter it, as the cell distributes its energy. It is, in effect, a\\nconnected series of cells. What makes it behave differently\\nfrom the cell proper is the fact that its power of resistance is\\nso small, and its stored up energy relatively so slight. The\\ncell, on the other hand, is something more than an explosive;\\nit is a conductor. As there is no difference, chemically,\\nbetween the firing of a gunpowder train and the resulting\\nexplosion of the magazine, so there is none, physiologically,\\nbetween the processes of the nerve and cell. The difference\\nof the result in both cases is due partly to the amount of\\nenergy at hand to be set free, and still more to the resistance\\noffered. In the cell there are no tracks laid down for the\\ncarrying off of the energy introduced. It meets resistance,\\nfriction, and accumulates till either the cell energy inhibits\\nthat introduced, or reacts upon it so as to increase it, and\\nsend it forth through the nerve.  This is not theory, but physiological fact. The experimental data\\nwith the conclusions warranted will be found set forth in Wundt,\\nMechanik der Nerven, ^and Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie,\\nvol. i, pp. 240-64.\\n»1\\n ― 96 ―\\n                            \\nI may seem to have dwelt needlessly upon so simple a\\npoint, but it is the foundation of any further approach to a\\ncorrect theory of psycho-physiological relations. The°conclu-sion\\nconclusion which it warrants in this respect is all important. In\\nbrief it is this: The psychical is homogeneously related to\\nthe physiological. Whatever is the relation of the psychical\\nto the neural, it is related in the same manner to all parts of\\nthe neural. The brain is no more the organ of mind than the\\nspinal cord, the spinal cord no more than the peripheral\\nendings of the nerve fibres. The brain is undoubtedly most\\nclosely and most influentially connected with the life of the\\nsoul, but its connection is of the same kind as that of every\\nother part of the nervous system. Now this gives us but one\\nalternative: either there is absolutely no connection between\\nthe body and soul at any point whatever, or else the soul is,\\nthrough the nerves, present to all the body. This means that\\nthe psychical is immanent in the physical. To deny this is to\\ngo back to the Cartesian position, and make a miracle of the\\nwhole matter—to call in some utterly foreign power to make\\nthe transition which is actually found. This may cater to our\\nlove of pictures, but it is out of the line which we have laid\\ndown for ourselves. The nineteenth century substitute of a\\ndouble-faced substance is only another excursion into the\\nland of fancy sketches. It makes the imagination the source\\nof an ontology. But it fares even worse than the Cartesian\\nscheme. A double-faced substance not only refuses to be\\nthought, but, if one is in earnest, refuses to be imagined. It\\nis the result of the decrepitude of the imagination as well as\\nof the laziness of thought. Not colors for the imagination to\\nsee, but principles for the understanding to think, is the\\ndesideratum. That compromise which seemed to think that\\nthe problem of the relations of soul and body was simplified\\nif the connection of the two could be reduced to as small a\\nspace as possible, and excluded it first from the fibre, then\\nfrom the spinal cord, then from the basal ganglia, the°cere-bellum\\ncerebellum, all of the cerebrum except the cortex, then possibly\\none point of the cortex,—that, too, must be abandoned. The\\nfact is, that the action of the nervous tissue is the same in\\nkind in the cortex and in the peripheral fibre, and hence if\\nany part of the nervous system has any connection with the\\n\\n ― 97 ―\\n                            \\nsoul which is not supernatural in character, every part must\\nhave, in kind, the same. All, or none, is the disjunction\\nforced upon us. The immanence of the psychical in the\\nphysical is, therefore, the foundation of our future inquiry.\\nThe nature of the immanence must now be inquired into.\\nThat there is unity of function in the cell and fibre is\\nestablished. What this function is and what conclusion it\\nwarrants are the questions now to be asked.\\nSecond. The fundamental nervous activity is a process\\nof adjustment, consisting in a twofold contemporaneous\\nprocess of stimulation and reaction or inhibition. If we turn\\nto the same physiological authorities whence we learned of\\nthe homogeneous nature of the action of fibre and cell, we\\nshall learn what this action is. Nervous tissue, in the first\\nplace, wherever found is a highly unstable chemical°com-pound\\ncompound. Any excitation tends to set up such chemical change\\nas will reduce it to relatively simpler and more stable°com-pounds\\ncompounds. There is thus set free an amount of energy°equiva-lent\\nequivalent to the amount which would be required to lift this lower\\ncompound up to its higher state again. The potential energy\\nof the unstable compound has, in short, become kinetic. The\\nfirst element in nervous action is, therefore, the excitatory or\\nstimulating, which has the setting free of nervous energy for\\nits result. But if this were all, the energy of the nervous\\nsystem would be soon used up. Every stimulus would set\\nfree nervous force, and the result would be that the body\\nwould respond to every stimulus, however slight, and the\\nprocess would end only with the complete exhaustion of the\\npower. We would be physically in the condition of those\\nhaving the Saint Vitus\\'s dance; mentally, in the state of\\nsome of the insane, who, having no reserve power, react\\nviolently upon every impression, intellectual or emotional,\\nuntil they sink into a stupor, out of which they come only to\\nrepeat the process. In short, there must be something which\\ngives control, which regulates the reaction, and which also\\nensures a reserve power. There must be opposed to the\\nexciting activity one which resists, and thereby prevents the\\nwhole force at hand, the whole unstable compound, from\\nbeing used, and which also restores it as it is expended. And\\nso it is found that there is a complementary process. Not\\n\\n ― 98 ―\\n                            \\nonly is energy being constantly put forth, but energy is\\nbeing constantly stored up or rendered latent. Not all the\\nforce which comes to a nervous element is employed in\\nbreaking down the unstable compounds and thereby losing\\nenergy; part—in some cases much the greater part—is used\\nin building up these unstable compounds, thereby forming a\\nreservoir of energy for future use, while the process itself\\nacts as a restraint upon, a control over, the excitatory factor.\\nEvery nervous action is, therefore, a reciprocal function of\\nstimulation, excitation, and inhibition; control through°re-pression\\nrepression. Every nervous activity is essentially an°adjust-ment\\nadjustment. It is called forth through the stimulus, but the°stimu-lus\\nstimulus is not the sole factor; it does not wander at its own sweet\\nwill, but is checked and directed by the reacting activity, the\\ninhibiting. This is true, of course, of every process, whether\\noccurring in fibre or in cell; but because of the structural\\ndifferences between the two, previously spoken of, the°for-mer\\nformer mode of action greatly predominates over the other in\\nthe fibre; while in the cell the inhibitory activity exceeds at\\nthe expense of the stimulating. Since the fibres correspond,\\nin a general way, to the peripheral nerve system and the\\ncells to the central, it may truly enough be said that the\\nstimulating or exciting is the peripheral, and the reacting\\nand controlling is the central or ganglionic.\\nLooked at from this point of view, the unitary nervous\\nactivity is evidently that known as reflex action. In that, we\\nhave precisely these relations of excitement on the one hand,\\nand adjusting activity on the other, of which we have just\\nbeen speaking. Our conclusions are as follows: there is a\\nfundamental mode of nervous activity; in this the psychical is\\nimmanent. This mode of activity is an adjusting activity;\\ntherefore the psychical is immanent in the physical as°di-recting\\ndirecting it toward a given end. It is not only immanent, but it\\nis teleologically immanent. This teleological character is\\nseen in the nature of the function itself as just described.\\nThe loss of the proper proportion of the stimulating and the\\ninhibiting activity is a token of morbid disorder. It is°patho-logical\\npathological. If the centres react on feeble stimuli, they squander\\ntheir force upon the little stimuli, which are constant, by\\nplaying upon them; if they react only upon very strong\\n\\n ― 99 ―\\n                            \\nstimuli, the force they contain is never put forth when\\nneeded to perform the proper adjustment of the organism.\\nBut in normal life we find that exact proportion between the\\ntwo activities which ensures that the force shall be used\\nwhen its expenditure is for the good of the organism, and\\nthen alone. If we take the simplest case of nervous action,\\nsuch a one as occurs in a cold-blooded animal deprived of all\\nits nervous apparatus except the spinal cord, it will only\\nrender still more distinct the teleological character as°objec-tively\\nobjectively manifested. Read the following account of Wundt:\\n\"A decapitated frog moves its legs against the pincers\\nwith which it is irritated, or it wipes away with its foot the\\ndrop of acid applied to the skin. It sometimes tries to get\\naway from a mechanical or electrical stimulation by a jump.\\nIf put into an unusual position (e.g., on its back) it often\\nreturns to its normal position. The stimulus does not°intro-duce\\nintroduce merely a motion in general, which spreads from the\\nirritated part with increasing intensity of the stimulus and\\ngrowing irritability, but the movement is adapted to the\\nexternal impression. It may be a movement of defence, or\\none to get rid of the stimulus, or a movement to remove the\\nbody from the sphere of irritation, or finally it may aim at\\nrestoration of the previous posture. This purposive°adapta-tion\\nadaptation to the stimulus stands out even more clearly in°experi-ments\\nexperiments by Pflüger and Auerbach in which the ordinary°condi-tions\\nconditions of movement are somewhat changed. A frog, for°exam-ple\\nexample, whose leg has been cut off on the side on which it is\\nirritated by acid, first makes some fruitless attempts with\\nthe amputated stump, and then, pretty regularly, chooses\\nthe other leg, which is wont to remain at rest when the\\nanimal is unmutilated. If the decapitated frog be fastened by\\nits back, and the inner side of one of its thighs be sprinkled\\nwith acid, it tries to get rid of the latter by rubbing the two\\nthighs against each other; but if the moved thigh be°sepa-rated\\nseparated far from the other, after a few vain attempts it°sud-denly\\nsuddenly stretches this one out, and pretty accurately reaches\\nthe point which was irritated. Lastly, if one breaks the\\nupper thighs of decapitated frogs and cauterizes, whilst they\\nare stretched on their bellies the lower part of their backs,\\nthey correctly touch the cauterized spot with the feet of the\\n\\n ― 100 ―\\n                            \\nbroken limb, in spite of the disturbing nature of the°treat-ment\\ntreatment. These observations, which may be varied in diverse\\nways, show that the animal can adapt its movements to its\\nchanged conditions.\" (Wundt, Grundzüge, vol. ii, p.\\n404.)\\nOf course what is true of this simplest form of nerve\\naction is still more true of the higher forms, until we have a\\nlarge number of nerve centres acting co-ordinately with\\neach other, and all subordinated to the execution of a given\\nact recognized as necessary for the preservation or°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of the organism. But it is enough for our purpose to\\ntake our stand upon this elementary form of reflex action,\\nand thus cut the very standing ground from under the feet of\\nthe materialist.\\nThis, then, is our conclusion: the psychical is°imma-nent\\nimmanent in the physical; immanent as directing it toward an\\nend, and for the sake of this end selecting some activities,\\ninhibiting others, responding to some, controlling others,\\nand adjusting and co-ordinating the complex whole, so as, in\\nthe simplest and least wasteful way, to reach the chosen end.\\nWe find, therefore, that in the simplest form of nervous\\naction there are involved categories transcending the°mate-rial\\nmaterial; principles to which matter, as such, is an entire\\nstranger. Matter per se knows no higher category than that\\nof physical causality. Its highest law is that of the necessities\\nof antecedent and consequent. In nervous action we find the\\ncategory of teleology. The act is not determined by its\\nimmediate antecedents, but by the necessary end. We have\\ngone from the sphere of physical to that of final causation,\\nand thereby we recognize that we have gone from the purely\\nphysical to the immanence of the psychical in the physical,\\ndirecting the latter for its own end and purpose.\\nThe materialist, with his reversed logic, which°at-tempts\\nattempts to get the higher from the lower, instead of°account-ing\\naccounting for the lower on the ground of the higher, utterly misses\\nthe nature of the case. To him, the fact of reflex action, the\\nfact of purposive adjustment (if he be far enough advanced\\nin the elements to recognize the fact at all) is evidence of the\\nself-sufficiency of matter. He forthwith makes teleological\\naction an attribute of matter, and intelligent purposiveness a\\n\\n ― 101 ―\\n                            \\nfunction of the material. He does not recognize that in doing\\nthis he is giving up all that characterizes matter as matter,\\nand is, in effect, recognizing the primacy of spirit. If°teleol-ogy\\nteleology belong to the essence of matter, and purposive regulated\\naction be the nature of the material, then matter and°mate-rial\\nmaterial cease to be what they are commonly regarded as being\\n(viz., matter and material), and become but the hiding\\nplaces (which are the dwelling places) of spirit and the\\npsychical. The dispute is not, I suppose, about what words\\nwe shall use, but what principles. Nor is the question, again,\\nabout pictures, but about laws of explanation. If we cease to\\nform a verbal or pictorial conception of matter we shall find\\nthat for scientific purposes it means the principle of physical\\ncausation; the constant and invariable relations of°anteced-ent\\nantecedent and consequent. To attempt to get more into the°con-ception\\nconception of matter is unscientific in that it is unwarranted;\\nand unscientific in that, if it were accomplished, it would\\ndestroy the basis of all physical science and leave it the field\\nfor the play of imaginative fancies by whose side the highest\\nflight of the science of the Greek, or of the Middle Ages,\\nwill sink into insignificance. The recognition of this one\\nprinciple of physical causation, the invariableness of°succes-sion\\nsuccession, is the theoretic basis of all physical science. To attempt\\nto include more is to destroy the principle without reason,\\nand to introduce unbounded confusion. Some foregleams of\\nthe depths of absurdity to which we may reach, once started\\non this course of surrendering principles to words or images,\\nmay be seen in the efforts of some German materialists,\\nwho, in their laudable efforts to be consistent, have found it\\nnecessary to supply the primordial atoms with sensations,\\nand who hold that the laws of the universe are to be deduced\\nfrom their primitive loves and hates, their desires and°striv-ings\\nstrivings. Such is the only consistent position for a materialist.\\nBut it is a consistency which looks marvellously like a°reduc-tio\\nreductio ad absurdum. And it is suicide as well, for it is to give up\\nthe very essence of the materialistic position, and to admit\\nthat the nature and laws of the material are constituted by\\nthe psychical, which is the determining and prior element in\\nthe case. To attempt to swallow up the psychical in the\\nmaterial is not only absurd, but it is useless, for the°psychi-cal\\n ― 102 ―\\n                            \\npsychical always revenges itself by encroaching upon the material,\\nand when we finally look for some independent speck of\\nmatter, there is none there. It has all been spiritualized. Or,\\nif there be one speck there, it must be defined in terms of the\\nconception of matter just laid down. It will be found to be\\nmatter because it acts according to the principles of physical\\ncausation and not of final causation; because it is determined\\nby its antecedent, not by an end working itself out in it. So\\nthat after all there is no choice for the materialist. If he will\\nbut once open his eyes to the fact of purposive action he has\\nno alternative. He may attempt to claim this function as an\\nattribute of matter; if he does, as just seen, he dematerializes\\nhis matter. He may admit that there is matter whose°princi-ple\\nprinciple and law is that of psychical causation. He will then\\nrecognize that whatever transcends this principle is°essen-tially\\nessentially non-material, and that with the appearance of°teleolog-ical\\nteleological action upon the scene, we have passed from the realm of\\nthe material into that of the psychical immanent in the\\nmaterial. This is rational, and this saves science from°be-coming\\nbecoming the sport of every inflated and ill-balanced\\nimagination.\\nThere is another method of escaping the significance of\\npurposive action, equally futile, but equally attractive to the\\nmind that prefers panoramas to principles. It is, at present,\\nthe more fashionable method. In brief, it is to admit that the\\nactions are at present teleological, but that they became such\\nthrough a long series of accidental experiments°(experi-ments\\n(experiments which were not experiments, as they were not trying\\nto reach any end) of which some happened to be°advanta-geous\\nadvantageous to the organism, and, surviving, give us now the\\nappearance of purpose. This theory attempts to make the\\nteleological an accidental product of the mechanical. It°gen-erally\\ngenerally hides itself behind imposing scientific terms connected\\nwith the theory of biological evolution. It uses its°\"varia-tions\\n\"variations\" and \"selection,\" and \"survival of the fittest\" and\\n\"heredity,\" and thinks that in the end it has got something\\nout of nothing—purpose out of accident. But the argument is\\nsuicidal. It only changes the special case into a general law.\\nIt gets rid of the primitive purposiveness of, say, a given\\nreflex act, only by importing purposiveness, and thus°intel-ligence\\n ― 103 ―\\n                            \\nintelligence, into the very structure of nature. It simply says that\\nnature is such that, by the observance of its own laws as\\nascertained by science, it gives rise to action for and by ends.\\nVariation, selection, heredity, as names, do not, I suppose,\\naccomplish the result. It is that there are embedded in the\\nvery constitution of things, forces and principles which as\\nthey work themselves out, by their action and reaction, give\\nrise to activity for an end, to purposive action. In short, not\\nonly is the structure of the nervous system such that it gives\\nrise to teleological action, but the structure of nature itself is\\nsuch that it gives rise to this special kind of purposive\\naction. He who has thought to get rid of teleology, and\\nthereby intelligence, in this special case, has done it only by\\nthe recognition of teleology, and thereby intelligence, as a\\nuniversal principle and acting force. Darwinism, far from\\noverthrowing this principle, merely establishes it as a°gen-eral\\ngeneral law of the universe, of the structure of things. Nature is\\nmade teleological all the way through.\\nFrom this digression, which has, I hope, developed the\\nargument, as well as secured it from possible misconception,\\nI return to the conclusion. The psychical is teleologically\\nimmanent in the physical. The simplest nerve action is not\\nso simple as to exclude the adaptive, purposive factor. It is\\nalways an adjustment. It is never a mere mechanical result\\nof a stimulus, but always involves selection, inhibition, and\\nresponse. The stimulus favorable to the well-being of the\\norganism is selected from the immense number playing\\nupon the organism; others, especially those unserviceable,\\nare inhibited, and then the action results according to the\\nneeds, that is, the purpose, of the organism itself. If we\\nbroaden our view and take in the consentaneous action of the\\nwhole organism, the conclusion appears only the more\\nclearly. The various sensory and muscular stimuli, almost\\ninfinite in number, are always co-ordinated and°harmoni-ously\\nharmoniously combined. The nerves of the cord, the cord itself, the\\nspecial sense nerves, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, the\\ncerebral hemispheres, with their infinitude of fibres and\\ncells, act as an adjusted unity for one purpose, and one alone\\n—the welfare of the organism. At times it may seem as if one\\npart were functioning alone, but it is always found (unless\\n\\n ― 104 ―\\n                            \\nthe action be pathological) that it is a relative independence.\\nThe end of the organism is best gained by allowing a certain\\namount of originative and self-executed action by the°partic-ular\\nparticular part. The apparent independence is but the evidence of\\nthe thoroughly teleological character of the whole. It°signi-fies\\nsignifies the division of labor in order that the whole task, the\\ndevelopment of the organism, may be the more speedily and\\neconomically effected. There is no communistic level, but\\nthe due gradation and subordination of the various factors in\\nthe unity of the whole, as in a well-organized society. There\\nis, in short, the co-ordination of all the nerve organs, and the\\nfurther subordination of all to the end of the whole, self-\\nrealization.\\nSuch is the conclusion we arrive at, without leaving the\\npurely physiological sphere. But such a conclusion is one-\\nsided and narrow, until expanded to take in all the°phenom-ena\\nphenomena. The body, through the nervous system, is not only a\\nphysiological, but a psycho-physiological organism.°Ex-pressed\\nExpressed in its lowest terms, there is sensation, as well as\\nadjustment of all the activities to one end. Those who have\\nasserted the spirituality of the soul have often begun to build\\ntoo high. They have taken as their fortress abstract thought,\\nor the free-will. Now these offer, indeed, an impregnable\\nrefuge, but, in opening the campaign from there, ground is\\nabandoned which, by all territorial rights, is the eminent\\ndomain of the spiritual soul. To return to the former°meta-phor\\nmetaphor, we can finally build higher and more firmly, because\\non a broader foundation, on the basis of sensation. Too often\\nis the claim of the materialist that sensation, at least, can be\\naccounted for by material processes, admitted explicitly or\\ntacitly. It seems to be thought that because the immediate\\nand close connection of sensations with the nerve organs and\\nthe brain can be made out, that thereby their material°char-acter\\ncharacter is established. At bottom, this is the survival of a\\nmetaphor, out of date at its very birth. The mischief that the\\nterm \"impression\" has played with psychology can never be\\nmeasured. One of the greatest claims which physiological\\npsychology has upon us is that it has forever outlawed the\\nterm and the conception. The only word which has any place\\nin psychology as expressing the material antecedent of the\\n\\n ― 105 ―\\n                            \\npsychical state, sensation, is stimulus. Our°semi-material-ists\\nsemi-materialists, like Mr. Huxley and Mr. Tyndall, always conclude\\ntheir baldest assertions of the dependence of the mind upon\\nthe brain with some such statement as this: The passage\\nfrom the physics of the brain, from a nervous irritation,\\nfrom a change of motion and matter, to a fact of°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, to a psychical state, to a sensation, is unthinkable, is an\\ninexplicable mystery, a gulf which imagination cannot span;\\nand so on, ad libitum. One would think that if they would\\ncease attempting to picture the transition and endeavor to\\nthink it, the explanation would be so patent as to stare them\\nfairly out of countenance. The \"mystery\" would explode in\\nits own fatuous vacuity. The unthinkable arises from the use\\nof wrong categories, wrong principles. No better evidence\\nthat the physical and the psychical are not related as cause\\nand effect, as producer and product, could be adduced than\\nthe utter \"mysteriousness\" hanging with \"inexplicable\"\\npersistence over all attempts to get one out of the other.\\nWhen it is recognized that \"inexplicability\" is not an°ulti-mate\\nultimate fact to be supremely contented with, but a positive\\ncondemnation of the method and principles which have led\\nto it, our scientific men will reflect twice before they thrust\\ntheir uncomprehended physical categories into the psychical\\nrealm, thereby begging the whole question, and, themselves\\nbeing witnesses, landing the whole affair in a mystery which\\ncannot be discriminated from an absurdity. It was°recog-nized\\nrecognized some hundreds of years ago that in geometry a°reduc-tio\\nreductio ad absurdum is a perfect and beautiful demonstration of\\nthe untruth of the original hypothesis. Let us hope that the\\nidea of the unity of all thought will finally dawn upon the\\nscientific men who have taken the contract of philosophizing\\nfor the English-speaking portion of the nineteenth century,\\nand that they will recognize that what holds in the basis of\\nall scientific reasoning holds also in the rudiments of\\nphilosophical.\\nWe will abandon, then, all attempts to picture the\\nconfessedly unimaginable, and those endeavors to explain\\nwhich lead us into the confessedly inexplicable. We will\\nbegin with the facts, and inquire what principle they force\\nupon us to explain them; we will not begin with a principle,\\n\\n ― 106 ―\\n                            \\nand, after having in nine-tenths of the paper victoriously\\n\"explained\" all facts by it, wind up with confessing that it is\\nall inexplicable, and accordingly go on to revel in the°unut-terable\\nunutterable bathos of the \"mysterious.\" If we take the facts, they\\nare simply these: (1) the constant sequence upon a certain\\nnervous process of a psychical state known as a sensation;\\n(2) the entire lack of any connection between the two by\\nway of physical causation, i.e., by way of identity of matter\\nand motion involved. The principle which this leads us to is\\nthat the physical antecedent is a stimulus necessary for the\\nproduction of a sensation; and that it is only a stimulus. The\\nsensation does not come from it, although it would never\\ncome without it. The sensation has its occasion from the\\nnervous process; it has its cause from within. The physical\\nprocess awakens the mind, it incites it to action; the mind,\\nthereupon, spontaneously and by its own laws develops from\\nitself a sensation. The specific names given to the various\\nfactors involved is of no importance, as long as it is°recog-nized\\nrecognized that the principle concerned is that of stimulus and\\nresponse; response, which, for its existence, depends upon\\nthe physical antecedent, but for its content and nature, upon\\nsomething else. We must recognize that we have got to go\\nbeyond the principle of physical causation to the principle of\\nself-developing activity, though an activity which is not\\ninfinite or self-produced, but dependent upon an occasioning\\nimpulse beyond it. In short, not only is the soul immanent in\\nthe body, as teleological, as subordinating and adjusting its\\nvarious activities to an end, but the body is the stimulus to\\nthe soul. It is the condition of the calling forth of its°activi-ties\\nactivities. It is the spark which fires the mind to light its own\\ninextinguishable flame. Sensation, and, a fortiori, all higher\\npsychical activities, testify to the creative, self-determining\\npower of the mind, with the proviso attached that this power\\nhas been called upon to act. There is just the same mystery\\nabout it that there is about every fact in the universe, the\\nmystery that there should be such a fact at all. As to°princi-ples\\nprinciples involved, there is no more mystery than in the°explana-tion\\nexplanation of any physical or chemical fact. In ultimate analysis,\\nthe spiritual principle is less mysterious, is lucidly°transpar-ent\\ntransparent in comparison with the mechanical; for it is only from\\n\\n ― 107 ―\\n                            \\nthe former that the latter gets its explanation and the°guar-antee\\nguarantee of its validity.\\nIf we include within our survey the°psycho-physiologi-cal\\npsycho-physiological facts as well as the purely physiological phenomena of\\nnerve action, we come to the conclusion that the soul not\\nonly directs and focuses the activities of the organism, but\\nthat it transforms them into something which they are not.\\nIt realizes itself upon the hints, as it were, given by the\\nbody. The soul is not only immanent in the body, as°consti-tuting\\nconstituting its unity and end; it is transcendent to it, as°trans-forming\\ntransforming its activities for its own psychical ends. It uses it as\\nmaterial out of which to build its own structure, as food by\\nwhich to nourish its own life. These two principles, of the\\nimmanence and the transcendence of the soul, to which we\\nhave been led by the study of the facts, cannot be left in this\\nisolated way. They must be shown in their unity as°necessar-ily\\nnecessarily involving each other. And again we turn to the facts of\\npsycho-physiological life with the assurance that the°princi-ple\\nprinciple will be involved in them, and that we are not left to the\\nlogical manipulation of our conceptions.\\nThey are the facts connected with the execution of\\ndefinite psycho-physiological functions. They may all be\\nincluded under the phrase \"localization of functions,\" if the\\nphrase be understood in a broad sense to mean the°perform-ance\\nperformance of any definite act of psychical bearings by any specific,\\norganized portion of the body. It would include, therefore,\\nthe performance of reflex acts by the spinal cord, as well as\\nthe supposed location of the \"speech centre\" in the third\\nfrontal convolution of the central hemisphere. The ground\\nfor this extension of the term is the unity of all nervous\\naction, as well as particular facts to be presently mentioned.\\nThe only difference between the regular and constant°\"local-ization\\n\"localization\" of reflex action in the spinal cord, and of speech in\\none part of the brain, is a difference of degree, not of kind.\\nThe difference is between a localization perfectly formed,\\nand a localization in process of forming. Organization of\\nfunction might be the better term.\\nIf we turn again to our authorities we shall find the\\nfacts substantially as follows:\\n1. In some form or other localization or, to use the\\n\\n ― 108 ―\\n                            \\nbetter term, organization of psychical function, is all but\\nuniversal. The body is not a homogeneous mass which is\\nindifferent, equally as a whole and in all its parts, to the\\nsoul. On the contrary, neither as a whole, nor in any of its\\nparts, is it neutral to the soul. That it is not as a whole, we\\nhave seen when considering the immanence of the soul in the\\nbody; that it is not in any of its parts, is simply a detailed\\napplication of the same principle. The soul is not only in the\\nbody, but it is in it in definite, particular ways. The body as\\na whole is not only the organ of the soul, but the various\\nstructures of the body are differentiated organs, of various\\ncapacities and tendencies, of the soul. That is the meaning\\nof the localization of function, or of the fact that certain\\nactivities have certain, more or less defined, nervous centres\\nin various portions of the spinal cord and brain.\\nTo give the specific evidence of this localization would\\nbe but to repeat the whole of the morphology and physiology\\nof the nervous system. The nervous system itself is but a\\ndifferentiation of the ectoderm; the special sense-organs are\\nonly so many continuations of the brain and spinal cord. If\\nwe take the various movements, we find that, in going from\\nthe simplest to the most complex, from the mere reflex\\naction to the most consciously purposive movement,°no-where\\nnowhere does the will act without a structure already formed\\nfor it. Learning the higher movements, like walking,°talk-ing\\ntalking, etc., is but the formation of the organized structures of\\nthe body. If these be wanting, no matter how completely the\\nend and the proper means of reaching it are present to\\nconsciousness, the volition cannot be performed. If we leave\\nthe motor and sensory spheres and come to the higher ideal\\noperations, the evidence for the localization of functions is\\nmuch less complete and forcible. But we need only to°recog-nize\\nrecognize the dependence of thought upon sense for its materials,\\nand largely upon language for its form, to be aware that the\\nsame principles must, in some degree at least, hold here\\nalso. The fact that in thinking we never deal with the\\nultimate psychical elements, but with symbolic wholes, with\\nprocesses already integrated, is still more striking°psycho-logical\\npsychological evidence of the same fact. Just as it would take hours\\nto perform a simple act like dressing, if the motor functions\\n\\n ― 109 ―\\n                            \\ndid not become organized in the bodily structure, if the will\\nwere obliged to go into detail of the act, instead of simply\\nsetting the whole mechanism into operation to work itself\\nout, so in the intellectual sphere. If the various sensations\\nand ideas remained isolated, if they were not organized into\\nwholes, if they were not changed from material into°struc-ture\\nstructure, the mind would require hours to take in the meaning of\\na single sentence, or to reason out a simple inference. But\\nthe fact is that the mind does not deal with ultimate°ele-ments\\nelements; it always has integral wholes which it may grasp and\\nuse without endeavoring or needing to resolve them. And\\nthat there is some similar physiological grouping and°inte-gration\\nintegration, some corresponding organization of function in the\\nbrain, all artificial experiments upon animals, and all natural\\nexperiments, performed by disease upon man, go to show.\\n2. But there must be explicitly stated, what has°al-ready\\nalready been suggested; viz., that the degree of this°localiza-tion\\nlocalization, both as to definiteness and completeness, varies very\\ngreatly. The lower the function, the more perfectly and\\nnarrowly is it localized. The wider its scope, and the greater\\nits consequent necessity, the more complete and spatial, so to\\nspeak, its localization. Thus the functions of breathing,°di-gesting\\ndigesting, swallowing, etc., which are necessary to life, and\\nwhich have only indirect psychical bearings, have very°defi-nite\\ndefinite and thoroughly localized centres; while the higher°activ-ities\\nactivities, like walking, talking, reading, and writing, involving\\nmore and more activities and of a more complex kind, have\\nless and less definite local centres. In the higher activities\\nthere is no perfect mapping out at all, but all sorts of\\nshadings-off and variations. So if we consider the sensory\\nsphere, we find that, while the sense-centres may for some of\\nthe lower animals be made out pretty certainly, there is no\\nsuch certainty and agreement in the case of man. And the\\nreason is evident; in the animals, the sensations remain\\nmostly what they are—pure sense-feelings, while in man\\nthese sensations have been so related and interpreted that\\nthey have become for the most part perceptions, and even\\nhigher ideal relations. Consequently we find that ideas as\\nsuch have no localization whatever. There is not the°slight-est\\nslightest evidence whatever that any special idea, whether a°per-cept\\n ― 110 ―\\n                            \\npercept, an image, or a concept, has any definite specific centre.\\nThere are all kinds of evidence that it has not. The elaborate\\ncalculations of Mr. Bain in his work upon Mind and Body\\ngoing to show that there are as many fibres and cells in the\\nbrain as the mind has separate ideas and associations, is\\nbased upon an utterly unfounded a priori assumption; viz.,\\nthat cells in the brain correspond to ideas, and fibres to\\nassociations. It cannot be stated too strongly, or insisted\\nupon too often, that there is not the slightest fragment of\\nexperimental evidence for the theory. There is much°experi-mental\\nexperimental evidence to show that the case cannot possibly stand\\nthus. This evidence may be summed up in the statement that\\nall lines of inquiry, morphological, anatomical, and°physio-logical\\nphysiological, converge to one result: the psychical function or\\nbearing of the cell is dependent, not on its own structure,\\nbut upon its connections by means of the fibres. An \"idea,\"\\nhowever simple it may seem, has not its physical basis in a\\ncell, but in a group of cells, connected and interconnected by\\nmultitudinous fibres. If the idea be very complex it may\\npossibly have relations to all the cells in the brain. This may\\nbe an extreme statement, but, beside the statement that any\\nidea may be localized in a given cell, it is truth itself. Hence\\nwe see the entire failure of all attempts definitely to localize\\nthe higher intellectual functions. The evidence does not°war-rant\\nwarrant the statement that, upon the whole, they have no°physi-cal\\nphysical connection; it does warrant the statement that the°rela-tions\\nrelations involved are so many, so far reaching, and so complex,\\nthat any attempt to find a sharply marked out centre must be\\nforever in vain.\\n3. The two statements already made that localization\\nis practically universal, and yet that the higher intellectual\\npowers cannot be definitely localized at all, do not contradict\\neach other. They find their reconciliation in the statement\\nthat localization is not original, but acquired. It has already\\nbeen stated that the localization is no quality originally\\ninherent in the cell; but that it depends upon the cell\\'s\\nconnections through its fibres. As Wundt says (Grundzüge,\\nvol. i, p. 225), \"No element executes specific functions, but\\nthe form of the latter depends upon the connections and\\nrelations of the cell.\" And this dependence of localized°func-tion\\n ― 111 ―\\n                            \\nfunction upon connection, is the same as to say that given°ele-ments\\nelements of the brain act in a certain way only because they\\nhave been associated in the performance of the act. The\\nlocalization is dependent upon use and exercise. Thus it is\\nthat Wundt goes on to state the two following principles:\\n\"Every definite function has, under given conditions of\\nconnection, a definite place in the central organ from which\\nit proceeds: that is to say, whose elements stand in relations\\nfitted for the execution of the function,\" and \"Every element\\nis the more fitted to the performance of a definite function,\\nthe more often it has been occasioned by external conditions\\nto its performance.\" Localization of function is, in short,\\nonly the physiological way of saying habit. The organization\\nof function is not indwelling in the brain as so much matter:\\nit has been learned by the brain and learned through the\\ntuition and care of the soul. By no twisting can the°phenom-ena\\nphenomena of localization of function be twisted into the support\\nof materialism. The very fibres and cells cry out against\\nsuch treatment. They all assert that the powers they have,\\nthey possess, not of their own original and indefeasible\\nright, but by means of the activity, and under the authority\\nof the soul. This accounts for the various degrees of°localiza-tion\\nlocalization found. The acts most necessary for the soul\\'s ends, and\\ntherefore oftenest performed, have, through heredity,°be-come\\nbecome definitely and completely organized, and, like reflex\\nactions, go on without consciousness, or, like instinctive\\nactions, involve others, which in complexity and far°reach-ing\\nreaching influence are beyond the immediate consciousness of the\\nmoment. But the soul, for its own ends, requires again that\\nits higher activities be not thus mechanized. There must be\\na constant growth, adjustment to new relations, intellectual\\nand moral, and this requires plasticity, variability. In the\\nhigher activities complete organization would mean°stagna-tion\\nstagnation, death. Thus it is that the higher we come, both in the\\nrange of animal life, and in the range of intellectual°func-tion\\nfunction, the less the localization. But in each case the evidence\\nall goes to show that the localization is not original, but is\\nacquired because the soul has repeatedly employed the given\\nelements for the performance of a given act. The soul does\\nnot write in water, but in the plastic brain and spinal cord.\\n\\n ― 112 ―\\n                            \\nLitera scripta manet. By the performance of its acts the soul\\ngains a mechanism by which to perform them again the\\nmore readily, economically, and perfectly.\\nThus we see how the phenomena of localization of\\nfunction give us a stand-point whence to view the nature of\\nthe immanence and transcendence of the soul. The soul is\\nimmanent in the body just so far as it has made the body its\\norganic instrument. The common saying that the \"body is\\nthe organ of the soul\" is literally much truer and more\\nsignificant than is usually thought or meant. The term\\n\"organ\" expresses a much more intimate and internal°rela-tion\\nrelation than is commonly understood. Organ presupposes°func-tion\\nfunction, and soul and body are related indeed as function and\\norgan, activity and instrument. As Aristotle said so long\\nago, the body is the organ of the soul, as the eye is the organ\\nof seeing. The body is not an external instrument which the\\nsoul has happened upon, and consequently uses, as a°musi-cian\\nmusician might happen upon a piano. The body is the organ of\\nthe soul because by the body the soul expresses and realizes\\nits own nature. It is the outward form and living°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of the soul. To quote from one of the most original and\\ndeeply spiritual thinkers whom America has yet produced:\\n\"It is the outward man, in and through which the inward\\npowers of the soul express their form and character. It is the\\nnecessary mode of our existence in the world of sense,°with-out\\nwithout the intervention of which we have no knowledge, either\\nobjective or subjective, no existence in nature, either in\\nspace or in time. It is not merely an organ to be conceived as\\ndistinct from our personal self, but it is our proper self as\\nexistent in space, in the order and under the laws of°na-ture\\nnature.\" President James Marsh, Remains, p. 257.\\n»2\\nBut this is only one-half the tale. The soul is immanent\\nin the body only because, and in so far as, it has realized\\nitself in the body. The body is its organ only because the\\nsoul has made the body its organ. The immanence is shown\\nby the localization; the transcendence, by the fact that this\\nlocalization has come about through the soul\\'s own°activi-ties\\nactivities. The body as an organ of the soul is the result of the\\n\\n ― 113 ―\\n                            \\ninforming, creating activity of the soul itself. In short, the\\nsoul is immanent in the body, not by virtue of the body as\\nmere body, but because, being transcendent, it has°ex-pressed\\nexpressed and manifested its nature in the body.\\nThe soul, accordingly, is not a powerless, impotent\\nsomething, so transcendent that it cannot be brought into\\nrelation with matter. It is a living and acting force which\\nhas formed, and is constantly forming the body, as its own\\nmechanism. This assures, on the one hand that no act or\\ndeed of the mind is ever lost, that it finds its registration and\\nrecord; and that not alone in some supralunary sphere, but\\ndown here in the world of matter; and, on the other hand, it\\nforms a mechanism by which the soul can immediately\\nknow, can grasp the fragments of its knowledge into one\\nsymbolic whole without laboriously gathering them and\\npiecing them together, and by which it can immediately act.\\nIt is, as it were, the mind\\'s automaton, ceaselessly and\\ntirelessly executing the demands responding to the needs of\\nthe soul. All the phenomena which the materialist parades\\nforth as \"proofs\"—the unconscious cerebration, the°auto-matic\\nautomatic, yet apparently intelligent, action in many states of\\nunconsciousness; the dependence of perception and memory\\nupon the proper condition and integrity of the brain; the\\naccompaniment of brain disease with unconsciousness and\\ninsanity; the ratio between mental power and weight and\\ncomplexity of the brain, etc., are the farthest removed from\\nevidence of materialism. They are but the conclusive°evi-dence\\nevidence of the thoroughness with which the soul has done its\\nwork, has formed its mechanism. They are all evidence that\\nthe soul is not hanging helpless in the air, but has made the\\nbody its home, and has realized itself so effectually in this\\nbody as its mechanism, that this mechanism can now act all\\nbut automatically, while disturbance of the mechanism of\\nthe organ excludes the execution of the corresponding°activ-ity\\nactivity, until the soul by its power form the organ again. The\\nmaterialist but looks at the body after the soul has done its\\nwork in making the body what it is, and cries, \"Lo, see what\\nthe body can do.\" Every one of the phenomena mentioned,\\nas well as all which the materialist can mention, concern the\\nformed body, the body in which the soul has already°organ-ized\\n ― 114 ―\\n                            \\norganized its functions. The true cry is, \"Lo, see what the soul\\nhas done. It has tabernacled in the flesh and transformed\\nthat flesh into its own manifestation. The body is the°body-ing\\nbodying forth of the soul.\"\\nIt was the \"master of those who know\" that said that\\nthe soul was the perfect realization or expression of a natural\\nbody, and at the same time, not the product of body, but its\\nvery life, its essence, its truth and reality—at once its final\\nand efficient cause. (Aristotle De Anima ii. 1.) And it was\\nthe Teacher of all who know, the Light which lighteth every\\nman that cometh into the world, who said: \"Except a corn\\nof wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone: but if\\nit die it bringeth forth much fruit.\" And it was the great\\ndisciple of the great Teacher who wrote \"That which thou\\nsowest is not quickened except it die; and that which thou\\nsowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare\\ngrain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain; but\\nGod giveth it a body as it has pleased Him, and to every seed\\nhis own body. . . . It is sown a natural body, it is raised a\\nspiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a°spirit-ual\\nspiritual body.\"\\nChristianity has no sympathy with those who have\\nsuch a superfine fear of materialism that they ætherialize\\nthe soul past all contact with the body. It knows that in the\\nbody the soul is incarnate; that through the soul the natural\\nbody comes to be a spiritual body, as the soul works itself\\nout, and realizes itself in it. The soul does apparently die in\\nthe body; it hides itself so effectually that the materialist says\\nthere is no soul; but it has died as dies the seed, to quicken\\nand transform the body. It is by no accident or meaningless\\nchance that we read in the Apostles\\' Creed those sublime\\nwords: \"I believe in the Resurrection of the Body.\" Catholic\\nhistoric Christianity, having such a confession on its lips,\\nhas no alliance with the metaphysical dualism of spirit and\\nmatter, and no fear of the exactest demonstrations of°phys-iology\\nphysiology regarding the closest connections of body and soul.\\nIt takes its stand upon the words of St. Paul, to which these\\ndemonstrations can only add more weight: \"There is a\\nnatural body and there is a spiritual body. . . . Howbeit\\nthat was not first which is spiritual, but that which is°natu-ral\\n ― 115 ―\\n                            \\nnatural; and afterwards that which is spiritual.\" There is the\\nbody, the natural body, first. Spirit indwells within the\\nbody, and manifesting itself, realizing its own nature, it\\nmakes that body its own organ and servant. It thus makes it\\nthe spiritual body. Let it be no surprise that physiological\\npsychology has revealed no new truth concerning the°rela-tions\\nrelations of soul and body. It can only confirm and deepen our\\ninsight into the truth divined by Aristotle and declared by\\nSt. Paul, and with good reason.\\n\\nDas Wahre war schon längst gefunden.\\n\\n ― 116 ―\\n                            \\nInventory of Philosophy Taught in American Colleges [First published in Science—Supplement, VII (16 Apr. 1886),\\n353-55. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nIn the general overhauling which the college curriculum has\\nbeen receiving of late, there has been one subject quite\\ngenerally overlooked,—that of philosophy. Apart from an\\noccasional editorial note in the columns of Science, I have\\nseen next to no allusion to the matter. Yet it is difficult to see\\nhow we are to develop a high grade of national culture in\\nscience and in literary matters without contact, by way\\neither of stimulus or of mirroring, or of both, of these\\nmatters with philosophic principles. Where this contact is to\\noccur, unless in college, it is also difficult to see. I have no\\nintention of discussing these matters here; but I wish to give\\nan inventory of the present condition of philosophic°instruc-tion\\ninstruction in our colleges, based upon the catalogues of these\\ninstitutions. Neither my knowledge nor the limit of space\\nallows me to go beyond a consideration of the subject taught\\nto discuss methods, etc.\\nThe philosophic discipline of the ordinary American\\ncollege is a survival of that period of its existence when its\\nespecial deed was to furnish to the community well-fortified\\nministers of the gospel. The catalogues of our colleges°re-veal\\nreveal all stages of evolution from this original source, but all\\nshow their genetic connection. The extent of evolution may\\nbe shown by considering the courses of four of the older\\nNew England institutions, selected from as many states. In\\nDartmouth the instruction begins with a twenty-four-hour\\ncourse in natural theology, followed by twenty hours of\\nanthropology. The pièce de resistance is sixty hours of°psy-chology\\npsychology (Porter\\'s Elements), which is supplemented by\\n\\n ― 117 ―\\n                            \\ncourses in ethics (twenty-five hours), history of ancient\\nphilosophy (twenty-six hours), æsthetics (fifteen hours),\\nand, to complete the circle with which the instruction began,\\na thirty-hour course in the evidences of Christianity. All\\nthis, certainly no insignificant amount, is required work.\\nThere is one elective of thirty-two hours in the history of\\nmodern philosophy.\\nCrossing the Connecticut River, and coming to the\\nUniversity of Vermont, we find the following courses:°psy-chology\\npsychology (Sully), logic (Davis\\'s Theory of Thought), ethics\\n(Calderwood), a short course in æsthetics, another short\\none in the evidences of religion, and quite an extensive\\ncourse in metaphysics, in which Watson\\'s Kant\\'s°Philoso-phy\\nPhilosophy in Extracts, and the exposition of Kant by Professor\\nMorris, are used. At Williams, as in the University of\\nVermont, all philosophical work seems to be required, the\\ncurriculum including the following subjects: anthropology\\n(Hopkins\\'s Outline Study of Man), logic, theology°(dog-matic\\n(dogmatic, apparently), natural theology (through the medium\\nof Flint\\'s Theism, and Butler\\'s Analogy), ethics, and the\\nhistory of philosophy. At Brown we find logic, three hours a\\nweek; intellectual philosophy, four hours, including studies\\nin Hamilton, Kant, Porter, Sully; ethics, five hours,°includ-ing\\nincluding Wayland, Calderwood, Kant, etc. There is also a course\\nin natural theology. In addition to these required courses,\\nthere is an elective in the history of philosophy.\\nNone of these colleges, it will be observed, is now a\\nprofessedly denominational college. It may be well,°accord-ingly\\naccordingly, to add one which is; viz., Trinity. Here the required\\nwork is ethics (through the medium of Wayland), Butler\\'s\\nAnalogy and his Sermons; metaphysics (Sir W. Hamilton),\\nand courses in psychology and logic. Elective courses are\\nthose in anthropology (Hopkins); ethics, two courses,—one\\nin Haven, and the other in Whewell and Plutarch, and\\nmetaphysics (McCosh). No very great differentiation is°ob-servable\\nobservable in these courses, although there is more ethics, and\\nmore ethics from a theological stand-point, in Trinity than\\nin other colleges.\\nWe turn now to the other end of the scale of evolution,\\nwhere the courses are almost wholly lecture courses, and\\n\\n ― 118 ―\\n                            \\nare, either entirely or in the major part, elective; and in\\nwhich, also, the instruction is mainly from the historical\\nside. Of such institutions, Harvard and the University of\\nMichigan are instances, perhaps the only ones. In the latter\\ncollege, the only required study in this line is a course in\\neither psychology (Murray) or logic (Jevons). Elective\\ncourses are, two in psychology, one in experimental and\\nanother in its relations to philosophic problems. The course\\nin the history of philosophy is three hours a week through\\nthe year. This is supplemented by a three-hour course in the\\nprinciples of philosophy, followed by a study of Hegel\\'s\\nLogic. The courses under the general head of ethics would\\ninclude a course in ethics, historical and theoretical; one in\\nthe philosophy of state and history; and a course each in\\nPlato\\'s Republic and Aristotle\\'s Ethics, occupying together\\ntwo hours per week through the year. Other courses are, one\\nin Spencer\\'s First Principles, and one each in æsthetics and\\nKant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason, the latter two being omitted\\nthis year.\\nThe Harvard courses include in the history of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, English philosophy, from Locke to Hume; French, from\\nDescartes to Leibnitz; and German, from Kant to Hegel;\\nand one each in German philosophy of the present day and\\nHegel\\'s Phänomenologie, which are omitted the present\\nyear. Psychology and logic (Bain and Jevons) are covered\\nin one course; there is also an advanced course in°experimen-tal\\nexperimental psychology. There is a course in the philosophy of°na-ture\\nnature, discussing Spinoza and Spencer. There are also five\\ncourses in ethics and philosophy of religion, comprehending\\none on philosophy in relation to ethics and religion (Royce\\'s\\nReligious Aspects of Philosophy); one on philosophy of\\nreligion; another on philosophic theism; one on historical\\nethics, including especially, it appears, Mill and Kant; and\\none on practical ethics of modern society. The account\\nwould be incomplete if we failed to notice Professor°Good-win\\nGoodwin\\'s courses in Plato\\'s Republic, and in the history of\\nphilosophy before Aristotle, with Professor Greenough\\'s\\ncourse on later Greek philosophy. All of these courses are\\nelective. It will be noticed that there are about the same\\nnumber of courses given in both the two last-mentioned\\n\\n ― 119 ―\\n                            \\nuniversities, but the courses appear to cover more hours per\\nyear at Harvard than at Michigan.\\nIntermediate between the two classes of colleges°dis-cussed\\ndiscussed, come, in the east, Yale and Princeton; in the west,\\nthe universities of Wisconsin and California. At Princeton\\nthere are required courses in psychology, logic, ethics, and\\nChristian evidences; elective courses in physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology, metaphysics, history of philosophy, and science of\\nreligion; and graduate courses in Plato\\'s philosophy, and\\none hour per week of discussion of philosophic problems. At\\nYale almost the only required studies in the senior year are\\nthe philosophic courses. The required studies are as follows:\\nlogic, psychology, ethics, natural theology, and evidences of\\nChristianity; the electives are, the history of philosophy, two\\nhours through the year; a course in Locke and Berkeley for\\ntwo hours first half-year, followed by \"special topics\" the\\nsecond half; and a two-hour course in physiological°psychol-ogy\\npsychology through the year.\\nThe list of colleges given might be considerably°in-creased\\nincreased; but it suffices, I think, to justify the division of\\ncolleges, so far as their philosophic teaching is concerned,\\ninto three classes, of which the first would include by far the\\ngreater number of institutions. Did space permit, it would\\nbe interesting to give the courses in two or three of the best\\nCanadian colleges. The practice there is to divide the°sub-jects\\nsubjects into \"pass\" and \"honor\" subjects; the former being\\npsychology, logic, and ethics, and the latter including quite\\na wide range. At McGill, for instance, besides courses in the\\nhistory of ancient and modern philosophy, the student must\\npass an examination on twelve masterpieces; for example,\\nAristotle\\'s Ethics, Descartes\\' Method and Meditations,°Spi-noza\\nSpinoza\\'s Ethics, Fraser\\'s Berkeley, Spencer\\'s First Principles,\\netc. At University College, Toronto, this honor-work°re-quires\\nrequires such solid reading as Green\\'s Introduction to Hume,\\nand his Prolegomena to Ethics.\\nFor the most part, these courses speak for themselves\\nto one familiar with the courses in German universities, or\\neven in Great Britain in the present renaissance of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy there. The greatest lack is undoubtedly in the°depart-ment\\ndepartment of the philosophy of nature. The philosophic°interpre-tation\\n ― 120 ―\\n                            \\ninterpretation and criticism of the principles of modern science seem\\nto be unknown save at Harvard and the University of°Michi-gan\\nMichigan. The greatest advance which any one familiar with the\\nphilosophic announcements of the last eight or ten years will\\nnotice is the growing tendency to introduce the history of\\nphilosophy, and especially the study of the originals,°partic-ularly\\nparticularly in Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and even Hegel. A striking\\nand welcome phenomenon is the increasing disuse of Sir\\nWilliam Hamilton. I do not say this with especial reference\\nto his philosophy, but because it is safe to say that the sole\\nideas which the vast majority of graduates of our colleges\\nhave of continental philosophy, have come, directly or°indi-rectly\\nindirectly, through Hamilton and Cousin; and it is difficult to\\nsay which is the more misleading as an authority in historic\\nphilosophy. Princeton presents one innovation, whence, I\\nthink, almost all of our colleges could learn something. It\\nhas called in men from its biological department to discuss\\nphysiological psychology. The discussion of the one subject\\nof visual sensation and perception could easily be made\\nremarkably fruitful for psychology, as well as leading up to\\nthe subject of space-perception in general, and the question\\nof empiricism and intuitionalism, and the function of°evolu-tion\\nevolution in psychical life. It is no discredit to our teachers of\\nphilosophy to say that it is almost impossible that they\\nshould have special knowledge in physiological psychology.\\nThe instructor of to-day has now, in the subject of logic,\\npsychology, ethics, the history of philosophy, and what is\\nvaguely called \"metaphysics,\" to cover a wider field than\\nthe teacher of any other branch; and restriction of subjects\\nrather than their enlargement is the need.\\nIt is impossible to discuss the subject of the future of\\nphilosophy-teaching in this country without reference to the\\nmooted question of \"electives.\" It is evident that the great\\nmajority of those American colleges that have not°intro-duced\\nintroduced the elective system are giving all the time to°philo-sophic\\nphilosophic studies possible, though I do not undertake to say\\nwhether or not that time be distributed in the wisest way. In\\nfact, the outside scoffer would probably say that relatively\\ntoo much time is given them, when all studies are required.\\nIt will be noticed that the colleges where least philosophy is\\n\\n ― 121 ―\\n                            \\nrequired are the ones where most is taught, and the ground\\nis most widely covered. Personally, I should not be surprised\\nto know that they are the ones where most vital interest is\\ntaken in these studies, save in the instances, happily many,\\nof the smaller colleges, where the philosophic teaching is in\\nthe hands of a man of such strong character that the°teach-ing\\nteaching is a lasting power for life in an ethical way, whatever\\nmay be said of the strictly technical value of the philosophy\\ntaught.\\n\\n ― 122 ―\\n                            \\nThe Psychological Standpoint [First published in Mind, XI (Jan. 1886), 1-19.

This is the sole condition of discussion\\nwhich shall be fruitful, and not word-bandying. It is the sole\\nway of discovering whatever of fundamental agreement\\nthere is between different tendencies of thought, as well as\\nof showing on what grounds the radical differences are\\nbased. It is therefore a most auspicious sign that, instead of\\neagerly clamoring forth our views on various subjects, we\\nare now trying to show why we hold them and why we\\nreject others. It is hardly too much to say that it is only\\nwithin the past ten years that what is vaguely called°Tran-scendentalism\\nTranscendentalism has shown to the English reading world just\\nwhy it holds what it does, and just what are its objections to\\nthe method most characteristically associated with English\\nthinking. Assertion of its results, accompanied with attacks\\nupon the results of Empiricism, and vice versa, we had\\nbefore; but it is only recently that the grounds, the reasons,\\nthe method have been stated. And no one can deny that the\\nwork has been done well, clearly, conscientiously and°thor-oughly\\nthoroughly. English philosophy cannot now be what it would\\nhave been, if (to name only one of the writers) the late\\nProfessor Green had not written. And now that the°differ-ences\\ndifferences and the grounds for them have been so definitely and\\nclearly stated, we are in a condition, I think, to see a°funda-mental\\nfundamental agreement, and that just where the difference has\\nbeen most insisted upon, viz., in the standpoint. It is the\\n\\n ― 123 ―\\n                            \\npsychological standpoint which is the root of all the°differ-ence\\ndifference, as Professor Green has shown with such admirable\\nlucidity and force. Yet I hope to be able to suggest, if not to\\nshow, that after all the psychological standpoint is what\\nboth sides have in common. In this present paper, I wish to\\npoint out that the defects and contradictions so powerfully\\nurged against the characteristic tendency of British°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy are due—not to its psychological standpoint but—to its\\ndesertion of it. In short, the psychological basis of English\\nphilosophy has been its strength: its weakness has been that\\nit has left this basis-that it has not been psychological\\nenough.\\nIn stating what is the psychological standpoint, care\\nhas to be taken that it be not so stated as to prejudge at the\\noutset the whole matter. This can be avoided only by stating\\nit in a very general manner. Let Locke do it. \"I thought that\\nthe first step towards satisfying several inquiries the mind of\\nman was very apt to run into was to take a view of our own\\nunderstandings, examine our own powers, and see to what\\nthings they were adapted\" (Book i, ch. 1, § 7). This, with\\nthe further statement that \"Whatsoever is the object of the\\nunderstanding when a man thinks\" is an Idea, fixed the\\nmethod of philosophy. We are not to determine the nature of\\nreality or of any object of philosophical inquiry by°examin-ing\\nexamining it as it is in itself, but only as it is an element in our\\nknowledge, in our experience, only as it is related to our\\nmind, or is an \"idea.\" As Professor Fraser well puts it,\\nLocke\\'s way of stating the question \"involves the°fundamen-tal\\nfundamental assumption of philosophy, that real things as well as\\nimaginary things, whatever their absolute existence may\\ninvolve, exist for us only through becoming involved in what\\nwe mentally experience in the course of our self-conscious\\nlives\" (Berkeley, p. 20). Or, in the ordinary way of putting\\nit, the nature of all objects of philosophical inquiry is to be\\nfixed by finding out what experience says about them. And\\nPsychology is the scientific and systematic account of this\\nexperience. This and this only do I understand to be°essen-tial\\nessential to the psychological standpoint, and, to avoid°misunder-standing\\nmisunderstanding from the start, I shall ask the reader not to think\\nany more into it, and especially to avoid reading into it any\\n\\n ― 124 ―\\n                            \\nassumption regarding its \"individual\" and \"introspective\"\\ncharacter. The further development of the standpoint can\\ncome only in the course of the article.\\nNow that Locke, having stated his method,°immedi-ately\\nimmediately deserted it, will, I suppose, be admitted by all. Instead\\nof determining the nature of objects of experience by an\\naccount of our knowledge, he proceeded to explain our\\nknowledge by reference to certain unknowable substances,\\ncalled by the name of matter, making impressions on an\\nunknowable substance, called mind. While, by his method\\nhe should explain the nature of \"matter\" and of \"mind\"—\\ntwo \"inquiries the mind of man is very apt to run into\"—\\nfrom our own understandings, from \"ideas,\" he actually\\nexplains the nature of our ideas, of our consciousness,\\nwhether sensitive or reflective, from that whose°characteris-tic\\ncharacteristic, whether mind or matter, is to be not ideas nor°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness nor in any possible relation thereto, because utterly\\nunknowable. Berkeley, in effect, though not necessarily, as\\nit seems to me, in intention, deserted the method in his\\nreference of ideas to a purely transcendent spirit. Whether\\nor not he conceived it as purely transcendent, yet at all\\nevents, he did not show its necessary immanence in our\\nconscious experience. But Hume? Hume, it must be°con-fessed\\nconfessed, is generally thought to stand on purely psychological\\nground. This is asserted as his merit by those who regard\\nthe theory of the association of ideas as the basis of all\\nphilosophy; it is asserted as his defect by those who look at\\nhis sceptical mocking of knowledge as following necessarily\\nfrom his method. But according to both, he, at least, was\\nconsistently psychological. Now the psychological stand-\\npoint is this: nothing shall be admitted into philosophy\\nwhich does not show itself in experience, and its nature, that\\nis, its place in experience shall be fixed by an account of the\\nprocess of knowledge—by Psychology. Hume reversed this.\\nHe started with a theory as to the nature of reality and\\ndetermined experience from that. The only reals for him\\nwere certain irrelated sensations and out of these knowledge\\narises or becomes. But if knowledge or experience becomes\\nfrom them, then they are never known and never can be. If\\nexperience originates from them, they never were and never\\n\\n ― 125 ―\\n                            \\ncan be elements in experience. Sensations as known or°expe-rienced\\nexperienced are always related, classified sensations. That which\\nis known as existing only in experience, which has its°exist-ence\\nexistence only as an element of knowledge, cannot be the same\\nwhen transported out of knowledge, and made its origin. A\\nknown sensation has its sole existence as known; and to\\nsuppose that it can be regarded as not known, as prior to\\nknowledge, and still be what it is as known, is a logical feat\\nwhich it is hoped few are capable of. Hume, just as much as\\nLocke, assumes that something exists out of relation to\\nknowledge or consciousness, and that this something is°ulti-mately\\nultimately the only real, and that from it knowledge,°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, experience come to be. If this is not giving up the\\npsychological standpoint, it would be difficult to tell what is.\\nHume\\'s \"distinct perceptions which are distinct existences,\"\\nand which give rise to knowledge only as they are related to\\neach other, are so many things-in-themselves. They existed\\nprior to knowledge, and therefore are not for or within it.\\nBut it will be objected that all this is a total°misappre-hension\\nmisapprehension. Hume did not assume them because they were prior\\nto and beyond knowledge. He examined experience and\\nfound, as any one does who analyzes it, that it is made up of\\nsensations; that, however complex or immediate it appears\\nto be, on analysis it is always found to be but an aggregate\\nof grouped sensations. Having found this by analysis, it was\\nhis business, as it is that of every psychologist, to show how\\nby composition these sensations produce knowledge and°ex-perience\\nexperience. To call them things-in-themselves is absurd-they\\nare the simplest and best known things in all our experience.\\nNow this answer, natural as it is, and conclusive as it seems,\\nonly brings out the radical defect of the procedure. The\\ndependence of our knowledge upon sensations—or rather\\nthat knowledge is nothing but sensations as related to each\\nother—is not denied. What is denied is the correctness of the\\nprocedure which, discovering a certain element in°knowl-edge\\nknowledge to be necessary for knowledge, therefore concludes that\\nthis element has an existence prior to or apart from°knowl-edge\\nknowledge. The alternative is not complex. Either these°sensa-tions\\nsensations are the sensations which are known—sensations which\\nare elements in knowledge—and then they cannot be°em-ployed\\n ― 126 ―\\n                            \\nemployed to account for its origin; or they can be employed to\\naccount for its origin, and then are not sensations as they are\\nknown. In this case, they must be something of which°noth-ing\\nnothing can be said except that they are not known, are not in\\nconsciousness—that they are things-in-themselves. If, in\\nshort, these sensations are not to be made \"ontological,\"\\nthey must be sensations known, sensations which are°ele-ments\\nelements in experience; and if they exist only for knowledge,\\nthen knowledge is wherever they are, and they cannot°ac-count\\naccount for its origin. The supposed objection rests upon a\\ndistinction between sensations as they are known, and°sensa-tions\\nsensations as they exist. And this means simply that existence—\\nthe only real existence—is not for consciousness, but that\\nconsciousness comes about from it; it makes no difference\\nthat one calls it sensations, and another the \"real existence\"\\nof mind or matter. If one is anxious for a thing-in-itself in\\none\\'s philosophy, this will be no objection. But we who are\\npsychological, who believe in the relativity of knowledge,\\nshould we not make a halt before we declare a fundamental\\ndisparity between a thing as it is and a thing as it is known—\\nwhether that thing be sensation or what not?\\nAs this point is fundamental, let me dwell upon it a\\nlittle. All our knowledge originates from sensations. Very\\ngood. But what are these sensations? Are they the sensations\\nwhich we know: the classified related sensations: this smell,\\nor this color? No, these are the results of knowledge. They\\ntoo presuppose sensations as their origin. What about these\\noriginal sensations? They existed before knowledge, and\\nknowledge originated and was developed by their grouping\\nthemselves together. Now, waiving the point that knowledge\\nis precisely this grouping together and that therefore to tell\\nus that it originated from grouping sensations is a good deal\\nlike telling us that knowledge originated knowledge, that\\nexperience is the result of experience,—I must inquire again\\nwhat these sensations are. And I can see but this simple\\nalternative: either they are known, are, from the first,°ele-ments\\nelements in knowledge, and hence cannot be used to account\\nfor the origin of knowledge; or they are not, and, what is\\nmore to the point, they never can be. As soon as they are\\nknown, they cease to be the pure sensation we are after and\\n\\n ― 127 ―\\n                            \\nbecome an element in experience, of knowledge. The°conclu-sion\\nconclusion of the matter is, that sensations which can be used to\\naccount for the origin of knowledge or experience, are°sensa-tions\\nsensations which cannot be known, are things-in-themselves\\nwhich are not relative to consciousness. I do not here say\\nthat there are not such: I only say that, if there are, we have\\ngiven up our psychological standpoint and have become\\n\"ontologists\" of the most pronounced character.\\nBut the confusion is deeply rooted, and I cannot hope\\nthat I have yet shown that any attempt to show the origin of\\nknowledge or of conscious experience, presupposes a°divi-sion\\ndivision between things as they are for knowledge or experience\\nand as they are in themselves, and is therefore°non-psycho-logical\\nnon-psychological in character. I shall be told that I am making the\\nwhole difficulty for myself; that I persist in taking the stand-\\npoint of an adult whose experience is already formed; that I\\nmust become as an infant to enter the true psychological\\nkingdom. If I will only go back to that stage, I shall find a\\npoint where knowledge has not yet begun, but where°sensa-tions\\nsensations must be supposed to exist. Owing to our different\\nstanding, since these sensations have to us been covered with\\nthe residues of thousands of others and have become°sym-bolic\\nsymbolic of them, we cannot tell what these sensations are;\\nthough in all probability they are to be conceived in some\\nanalogy to nervous shocks. But the truth of our°psychologi-cal\\npsychological analysis does not depend upon this. The fact that°sensa-tions\\nsensations exist before knowledge and that knowledge comes\\nabout by their organic registration and integration is°undis-puted\\nundisputed. And I can imagine that I am told that if I would but\\nconfine myself to the analysis of given facts, I should find\\nthis whole matter perfectly simple—that the sensations have\\nnot the remotest connection with any sort of \"metaphysics\"\\nor analogy with things-in-themselves, and that we are all the\\ntime on positive scientific ground. I hope so. We are°cer-tainly\\ncertainly approaching some degree of definiteness in our°con-ception\\nconception of what constitutes a sensation. But I am afraid that\\nin thus defining the nature of a sensation, in taking it out of\\nthe region of vagueness, my objector has taken from it all\\nthose qualities which would enable it to serve as the origin of\\nknowledge or of conscious experience. It is no longer a\\n\\n ― 128 ―\\n                            \\nthing-in-itself, but neither is it, I fear, capable of accounting\\nfor experience. For, alas, we have to use experience to°ac-count\\naccount for it. An infant, whether I think myself back to my\\nearly days or select some other baby, is, I suppose, a known\\nobject existing in the world of experience; and his nervous\\norganism and the objects which affect it, these too, I°sup-pose\\nsuppose, are known objects which exist for consciousness.\\nSurely it is not a baby thing-in-itself which is affected, nor a\\nworld thing-in-itself which calls forth the sensation. It is the\\nknown baby and a known world in definite action and°reac-tion\\nreaction upon each other, and this definite relation is precisely a\\nsensation. Yes, we are on positive scientific ground, and for\\nthat very reason we are on ground where the origin of\\nknowledge and experience cannot be accounted for. Such a\\nsensation I can easily form some conception of. I can even\\nimagine how such sensations may by their organic°registra-tion\\nregistration and integration bring about that knowledge which I\\nmay myself possess. But such a sensation is not prior to\\nconsciousness or knowledge. It is but an element in the\\nworld of conscious experience. Far from being that from\\nwhich all relations spring, it is itself but one relation—the\\nrelation between an organic body, and one acting upon it.\\nSuch a sensation, a sensation which exists only within and\\nfor experience, is not one which can be used to account for\\nexperience. It is but one element in an organic whole, and\\ncan no more account for the whole, than a given digestive\\nact can account for the existence of a living body, although\\nthis digestive act and others similar to it may no doubt be\\nshown to be all important in the formation of a given living\\nbody. In short, we have finally arrived at the root of the\\ndifficulty. Our objector has been supposing that he could\\naccount for the origin of consciousness or knowledge°be-cause\\nbecause he could account for the process by which the given\\nknowledge of a given individual came about. But if he\\naccounts for this by something which is not known, which\\ndoes not exist for consciousness, he is leaving the°psycholog-ical\\npsychological standpoint to take the ontological; if he accounts for it\\nby a known something, as a sensation produced by the\\nreaction of a nervous organism upon a stimulus, he is°ac-counting\\naccounting for its origin from something which exists only for\\n\\n ― 129 ―\\n                            \\nand within consciousness. Consequently he is not accounting\\nfor the origin of consciousness or knowledge as such at all.\\nHe is simply accounting for the origin of an individual\\nconsciousness, or a specific group of known facts, by°refer-ence\\nreference to the larger group of known facts or universal°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. Hence also the historic impotency of all forms of\\nmaterialism. For either this matter is unknown, is a thing-\\nin-itself, and hence may be called anything else as well as\\nmatter; or it is known, and then becomes but one set of the\\nrelations which in their completeness constitute mind,—\\nwhen to account for mind from it is to assume as ultimate\\nreality that which has existence only as substantiated by\\nmind. To the relations of the individual to the universal\\nconsciousness, I shall return later. At present, I am°con-cerned\\nconcerned only to point out that, if a man comes to the°conclu-sion\\nconclusion that all knowledge is relative, that existence means\\nexistence for consciousness, he is bound to apply this°conclu-sion\\nconclusion to his starting-point and to his process. If he does this,\\nhe sees that the starting-point (in this case, sensations) and\\nthe process (in this case, integration of sensations) exists\\nfor consciousness also-in short, that the becoming of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness exists for consciousness only, and hence that°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness can never have become at all. That for which all\\norigin and change exists, can never have originated or\\nchanged.\\nI hope that my objector and myself have now got\\nwithin sight of each other so that we can see our common\\nground, and the cause of our difference. We both admit that\\nthe becoming of certain definite forms of knowledge, say\\nSpace, Time, Body, External World, etc., etc., may (in\\nideal, at least, if not yet as matter of actual fact) be°ac-counted\\naccounted for, as the product of a series of events. Now he\\nsupposes that, because the origin of some or all of our\\nknowledge or conscious experience, knowledge of all°partic-ular\\nparticular things and of all general relations, can be thus°ac-counted\\naccounted for, he has thereby accounted for the origin of\\nconsciousness or knowledge itself. All I desire to point out is\\nthat he is always accounting for their origin within°knowl-edge\\nknowledge or conscious experience, and that he cannot take his\\nfirst step or develop this into the next, cannot have either\\n\\n ― 130 ―\\n                            \\nbeginning or process, without presupposing known elements\\n—the whole sphere of consciousness, in fact. In short, what\\nhe has been doing, is not to show the origin of consciousness\\nor knowledge, but simply how consciousness or knowledge\\nhas differentiated itself into various forms. It is indeed the\\nbusiness of the psychologist to show how (not the ideas of\\nspace and time, etc., but) space, time, etc., arise, but since\\nthis origin is only within or for consciousness, it is but the\\nshowing of how knowledge develops itself; it is but the\\nshowing of how consciousness specifies itself into various\\ngiven forms. He has not been telling us how knowledge\\nbecame, but how it came to be in a certain way, that is, in a\\ncertain set of relations. In making out the origin of any or all\\nparticular knowledges (if I may be allowed the word), he is\\nbut showing the elements of knowledge. And in doing this,\\nhe is performing a twofold task. He is showing on the one\\nhand what place they hold within experience, i.e., he is\\nshowing their special adequacy or validity, and on the other\\nhe is explicating the nature of consciousness or experience.\\nHe is showing that it is not a bare form, but that, since these\\ndifferent elements arise necessarily within it, it is an infinite\\nrichness of relations. Let not the psychologist imagine then\\nthat he is showing the origin of consciousness, or of°experi-ence\\nexperience. There is nothing but themselves from which they can\\noriginate. He is but showing what they are, and, since they\\nare, what they always have been.\\nI hope that it has now been made plain that the polemic\\nagainst the attempt of the psychologist to account for the\\norigin of conscious experience does not originate in any\\ndesire to limit his sphere but simply to call him away from a\\nmeaningless and self-contradictory conception of the°psy-chological\\npsychological standpoint to an infinitely fruitful one. The°psy-chological\\npsychological standpoint as it has developed itself is this: all\\nthat is, is for consciousness or knowledge. The business of\\nthe psychologist is to give a genetic account of the various\\nelements within this consciousness, and thereby fix their\\nplace, determine their validity, and at the same time show\\ndefinitely what the real and eternal nature of this°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness is. If we actually believe in experience, let us be in\\nearnest with it, and believe also that if we only ask, instead\\nof assuming at the outset, we shall find what the infinite\\n\\n ― 131 ―\\n                            \\ncontent of experience is. How experience became we shall\\nnever find out, for the reason that experience always is. We\\nshall never account for it by referring it to something else,\\nfor \"something else\" always is only for and in experience.\\nWhy it is, we shall never discover, for it is a whole. But how\\nthe elements within the whole become we may find out, and\\nthereby account for them by referring them to each other\\nand to the whole, and thereby also discover why they are.\\nWe have now reached positive ground, and, in the\\nremainder of the paper, I wish to consider the relations,\\nwithin this whole, of various specific elements which have\\nalways been \"inquiries into which the mind of man was very\\napt to run,\" viz.: the relations of subject and object, and the\\nrelations of Universal and Individual, or Absolute and°Fi-nite\\nFinite.\\nII.\\n\\nFrom the psychological standpoint the relation of°sub-ject\\nsubject and object is one which exists within consciousness.\\nAnd its nature or meaning must be determined by an°exami-nation\\nexamination of consciousness itself. The duty of the psychologist\\nis to show how it arises for consciousness. Put from the\\npositive side, he must point out how consciousness°differen-tiates\\ndifferentiates itself so as to give rise to the existence within, that is\\nfor, itself of subject and object. This operation fixes the\\nnature of the two (for they have no nature aside from their\\nrelation in consciousness), and at the same time explicates\\nor develops the nature of consciousness itself. In this case, it\\nreveals that consciousness is precisely the unity of subject\\nand object.\\nNow Psychology has never been so false to itself as to\\nutterly forget that this is its task. From Locke downwards\\nwe find it dealing with the problems of the origin of space,\\ntime, the \"ideas\" of the external world, of matter, of body,\\nof the Ego, etc., etc. But it has interpreted its results so as to\\ndeprive them of all their meaning. It has most successfully\\navoided seeing the necessary implications of its own°proce-dure\\nprocedure. There are in particular two interpretations by which it\\nhas evaded the necessary meaning of its own work.\\nThe first of these I may now deal with shortly, as it is\\n\\n ― 132 ―\\n                            \\nnothing but our old friend x, the thing-in-itself in a new\\nguise. It is Reasoned or Transfigured Realism. It sees\\nclearly enough that everything which we know is relative to\\nour consciousness, and it sees also clearly enough that our\\nconsciousness is also relative. All that we can know exists\\nfor our consciousness; but when we come to account for our\\nconsciousness we find that this too is dependent. It is°de-pendent\\ndependent on a nervous organism; it is dependent upon objects\\nwhich affect this organism. It is dependent upon a whole\\nseries of past events formulated by the doctrine of evolution.\\nBut this body, these objects, this series of events, they too\\nexist but for our consciousness. Now there is no°\"metaphys-ics\\n\"metaphysics\" about all this. It is positive science. Still there is a\\ncontradiction. Consciousness at once depends upon objects\\nand events, and these depend upon, or are relative to°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. Hence the fact of the case must be this: The\\nnervous organism, the objects, the series of events as known\\nare relative to our consciousness, but since this itself is\\ndependent, is a product, there is a reality behind the°proc-esses\\nprocesses, behind our consciousness, which has produced them\\nboth. Subject and object as known are relative to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, but there is a larger circle, a real object from which\\nboth of them emerge, but which can never be known, since\\nto know is to relate to our consciousness. This is the°prob-lem\\nproblem: on one hand, the relativity of all knowledge to our\\nconsciousness; on the other, the dependence of our°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness on something not itself. And this is the solution:\\na real not related to consciousness, but which has produced\\nboth consciousness itself, and the objects which as known\\nare relative to consciousness. Now all that has been said in\\nthe first part of this article has gone for naught if it is not\\nseen that such an argument is not a solution of the°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction, but a statement of it. The problem is to reconcile the\\nundoubted relativity of all existence as known, to°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, and the undoubted dependence of our own°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness. And it ought to be evident that the only way to°recon-cile\\nreconcile the apparent contradiction, to give each its rights°with-out\\nwithout denying the truth of the other, is to think them together.\\nIf this is done, it will be seen that the solution is that the\\nconsciousness to which all existence is relative is not our\\n\\n ― 133 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness, and that our consciousness is itself relative to\\nconsciousness in general. But Reasoned Realism attempts to\\nsolve the problem not by bringing the elements together, but\\nby holding them apart. It does not seek the higher unity\\nwhich enables each to be seen as indeed true, but it attempts\\nto divide. It attributes one element of the contradiction to\\nour consciousness, and another to a thing-in-itself—the°un-known\\nunknown reality. But this is only an express statement of the\\ncontradiction. If all be relative to consciousness, there is\\nno thing-in-itself, just consciousness itself. If there be a\\nthing-in-itself then all is not relative to consciousness. Let a\\nman hold the latter if he will, but let him expressly°recog-nize\\nrecognize that thereby he has put himself on \"ontological\"\\nground and adopted an \"ontological\" method. Psychology\\nhe has for ever abandoned.\\nThe other evasion is much more subtle and°\"rea-soned\\n\"reasoned.\" It is a genuine attempt to untie the Gordian knot, as\\nthe other was a slashing attempt to cut it with the sword of a\\nthing-in-itself. It is Subjective Idealism. And I wish now to\\nshow that Subjective Idealism is not the meaning of the\\npsychological standpoint applied to the relation of subject\\nand object. It is rather a misinterpretation of it based upon\\nthe same refusal to think two undoubted facts in their unity,\\nthe same attempt to divide the contradiction instead of°solv-ing\\nsolving it, which we have seen in the case of attempts to°deter-mine\\ndetermine the origin of knowledge, and of Transfigured Realism.\\nThe position is this: The necessary relation of the world of\\nexistences to consciousness is recognized. \"There is no°pos-sible\\npossible knowledge of a world except in reference to our minds\\n—knowledge is a state of mind. The notion of material\\nthings is a mental fact. We are incapable even of discussing\\nthe existence of an independent material world; the very fact\\nis a contradiction. We can speak only of a world presented\\nto our own minds\" (Bain, The Senses and the Intellect, p.\\n375). But this being stated, consciousness is now separated\\ninto two parts—one of which is the subject, which is°identi-fied\\nidentified with mind, Ego, the Internal; while the other is the\\nobject, which is identified with the External, the Non-Ego,\\nMatter. \"Mind is definable, in the first instance, by the\\nmethod of contrast, or as a remainder arising from°subtract-ing\\n ― 134 ―\\n                            \\nsubtracting the object world from the totality of conscious experi-\\nence\" (Bain, p. 1). \"The totality of our mental life is made\\nup of two kinds of consciousness—the object consciousness\\nand the subject consciousness. The first is the external\\nworld, or Non-Ego; the second is our Ego, or mind proper\"\\n(Bain, p. 378). Consciousness \"includes our object states as\\nwell as our subject states. The object and subject are both\\nparts of our being, as I conceive, and hence we have a\\nsubject consciousness, which is in a special sense Mind (the\\nscope of mental science), and an object consciousness in\\nwhich all other sentient beings participate, and which gives\\nus the extended and material universe\" (Bain, p. 669). It\\nis, of course, still kept in view (which constitutes the logical\\nsuperiority of Subjective Idealism over Realism) that \"the\\nobject consciousness, which we call Externality, is still a\\nmode of self in the most comprehensive sense\" (Bain, p.\\n378). \"Object experience is still conscious experience, that\\nis Mind\" (Bain, p. 2). I have quoted at this length because\\nthe above passages seem to me an admirable statement of a\\nrepresentative type of Subjective Idealism.\\nThe logic of the process seems to be as follows. It is\\nrecognized that all existence with which philosophy or°any-thing\\nanything else has to do must be known existence-that is, that\\nall existence is for consciousness. If we examine this°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, we shall find it testifying to \"two kinds of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness\"—one, a series of sensations, emotions and ideas,\\netc., the other, objects determined by spatial relations. We\\nhave to recognize then two parts in consciousness, a subject\\npart, mind more strictly speaking, and an object part,°com-monly\\ncommonly called the external world or matter. But it must not\\nbe forgotten that this after all is a part of my own being, my\\nconsciousness. The subject swallows up the object. But this\\nsubject, again, \"segregates\" itself into \"two antithetical\\nhalves,\" into \"two parts,\" the subject and the object. Then\\nagain the object vanishes into the subject, and again the\\nsubject divides itself. And for ever the process is kept up.\\nNow the point I wish to make is that consciousness is here\\nused in two entirely different senses, and that the apparent\\nplausibility of the argument rests upon their confusion.\\nThere is consciousness in the broad sense, consciousness\\n\\n ― 135 ―\\n                            \\nwhich includes subject and object; and there is°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness in the narrow sense, in which it is equivalent to\\n\"mind,\" \"Ego,\" that is, to the series of conscious states.\\nThe whole validity of the argument rests, of course, upon\\nthe supposition that ultimately these two are just the same\\n—that it is the individual consciousness, the \"Ego,\" which\\ndifferentiates itself into the \"two kinds of consciousness,\"\\nsubject and object. If not, \"mind,\" as well as \"matter\"—the\\nseries of psychical states or events which constitute the Ego\\nand are \"the scope of mental science,\" as well as that in\\nwhich all \"sentient beings participate\"—is but an element in\\nconsciousness. If this be so, Subjective Idealism is°aban-doned\\nabandoned and Absolute Idealism (to which I hardly need say\\nthis article has been constantly pointing) is assumed. The\\nessence of Subjective Idealism is that the subject°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness or mind, which remains after the \"object world has\\nbeen subtracted,\" is that for which after all this object world\\nexists. Were this not so—were it admitted that this subject,\\nmind, and the object, matter, are both but elements within,\\nand both exist only for, consciousness—we should be in the\\nsphere of an eternal absolute consciousness, whose partial\\nrealization both the individual \"subject\" and the \"external\\nworld\" are. And I wish to show that this is the only meaning\\nof the facts of the case; that Subjective Idealism is but the\\nbald statement of a contradiction.\\nThis brief digression is for the purpose of showing\\nthat, to Subjective Idealism, the consciousness for which all\\nexists is the consciousness which is called mind, Ego, \"my\\nbeing.\" The point which I wished to make was that this\\nidentification is self-contradictory, although it is absolutely\\nnecessary to this form of Idealism. I shall be brief here in\\norder not to make a simple matter appear complicated. How\\ncan consciousness which gives rise to the \"two kinds\" of\\nconsciousness be identified with either of them? How can the\\nconsciousness which in its primary aspect exists in time as a\\nseries of psychical events or states be the consciousness for\\nwhich a permanent world of spatially related objects, in\\nwhich \"all sentient beings participate,\" exists? How can the\\n\"mind\" which is defined by way of \"contrast,\" which exists\\nafter the object world has been \"subtracted\" be the mind\\n\\n ― 136 ―\\n                            \\nwhich is the whole, of which subject and object are alike\\nelements? To state that the mind, in the first instance, is but\\nthe remainder from the totality of conscious experience\\n\"minus the object world,\" and to state also \"that this object\\nworld is itself a part of mind,\"—what is that but to state in\\nterms a self-contradiction? Unless it be to state that this\\nway of looking at mind, \"in the first instance,\" is but a\\npartial and unreal way of looking at it, and that mind in\\ntruth is the unity of subject and object, one of which cannot\\nbe subtracted from the other, because it has absolutely no\\nexistence without the other. Is it not a self-contradiction to\\ndeclare that the \"scope of mental science\" is subject°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness or mind, and at the same time to declare that\\n\"both subject and object are parts of our being,\" are but\\n\"two kinds\" of consciousness? Surely Psychology ought to\\nbe the science of our whole being, and of the whole°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness. But no words can make the contradiction clearer\\nthan the mere statement of it. The only possible hypothesis\\nupon which to reconcile the two statements that mind is\\nconsciousness with the object world subtracted, and that it is\\nthe whole of our conscious experience, including both°sub-ject\\nsubject and object world, is that the term \"Mind\" is used in two\\nentirely different senses in the two cases. In the first it must\\nbe individual mind, or consciousness, and in the second it\\nmust be absolute mind or consciousness, for and in which\\nalone the individual or subject consciousness and the°exter-nal\\nexternal world or object consciousness exist and get their reality.\\nThe root of the whole difficulty is this. It is the°busi-ness\\nbusiness of Psychology to take the whole of conscious experience\\nfor its scope. It is its business to determine within this whole\\nwhat the nature of subject and object are. Now Subjective\\nIdealism identifies at the outset, as may be seen in the\\npassages quoted, subject with \"Mind,\" \"Ego,\" and object\\nwith \"Matter,\" \"Non-Ego,\" \"External World,\" and then\\ngoes on to hold that the \"scope\" of Psychology is the former\\nonly. In short, the psychological standpoint, according to\\nwhich the nature of subject and object was to be determined\\nfrom the nature of conscious experience, was abandoned at\\nthe outset. It is presumed that we already know what the\\n\"subject\" is, and Psychology is confined to treatment of\\n\\n ― 137 ―\\n                            \\nthat. It is assumed that we know already what the \"object\"\\nis, and Psychology is defined by its elimination. This\\nmethod, as Psychology, has two vices. It is \"ontological,\"\\nfor it sets up some external test to fix upon the nature of\\nsubject and object; and it is arbitrary, for it dogmatically\\npresupposes the limitation of Psychology to a series of°sub-jective\\nsubjective states. It assumes that Psychology instead of being\\nthe criterion of all, has some outside criterion from which its\\nown place and subject-matter is determined, and more°spe-cifically\\nspecifically, it assumes that the standpoint of Psychology is\\nnecessarily individual or subjective. Why should we be told\\nthat the scope of Psychology is subject consciousness, and\\nsubject consciousness be defined as the totality of conscious\\nexperience minus the object world, unless there is°presup-posed\\npresupposed a knowledge of what subject and object are? How\\ndifferent is the method of the true psychological standpoint!\\nIt shows how subject and object arise within conscious°expe-rience\\nexperience, and thereby develops the nature of consciousness. It\\nshows it to be the unity of subject and object. It shows\\ntherefore that there cannot be \"two kinds\" of consciousness,\\none subject, the other object, but that all consciousness\\nwhether of \"Mind,\" or of \"Matter\" is, since consciousness,\\nthe unity of subject and object. Consciousness may, and\\nundoubtedly does, have two aspects—one aspect in which it\\nappears as an individual, and another in which it appears as\\nan external world over against the individual. But there are\\nnot two kinds of consciousness, one of which may be°sub-tracted\\nsubtracted from the whole and leave the other. They are but\\nconsciousness in one phase, and how it is that consciousness\\nassumes this phase, how it is that this division into the\\nindividual and the external world arises for consciousness\\n(in short, how consciousness in one stage appears as°percep-tion\\nperception),—that is precisely the business of Psychology to°deter-mine\\ndetermine. But it does not determine it by assuming at the outset\\nthat the subject is \"me,\" and the object is the world. And if\\nthis be not assumed at the outset it certainly will not be\\nreached at the conclusion. The conclusion will show that the\\ndistinction of consciousness into the individual and the world\\nis but one form in which the relation of subject and object,\\nwhich everywhere constitutes consciousness, appears. This\\n\\n ― 138 ―\\n                            \\nbrings us definitely to the relation of the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness.\\nIII.\\n\\nWe have seen that the attempt to account for the origin\\nof knowledge, at bottom, rests on the undoubted fact that\\nthe individual consciousness does become, but also that the\\nonly way to account for this becoming, without°self-contra-diction\\nself-contradiction, is by the postulate of a universal consciousness. We\\nhave seen again that the truth at the bottom of Subjective\\nIdealism is the undoubted fact that all existence is relative to\\nour consciousness, but also that the only consistent meaning\\nof this fact is that our consciousness as individual is itself\\nrelative to a universal consciousness. And now I am sure\\nthat my objector, for some time silent, will meet me with\\nrenewed vigor. He will turn one of these arguments against\\nthe other and say: \"After all, this consciousness for which\\nall exists is your individual consciousness. The universal\\nconsciousness itself exists only for it. You may say indeed\\nthat this individual consciousness, which has now absorbed\\nthe universal again, shows the universal as necessary to its\\nown existence, but this is only to fall into the contradiction\\nwhich you have already urged against a similar view on the\\npart of Subjective Idealism. Your objection in that case was\\nthat consciousness divided into subject consciousness and\\nobject consciousness, of which the former immediately°ab-sorbed\\nabsorbed the latter, and again subdivided itself into the subject\\nand object consciousness. You objected that this was the\\nexpress statement of a contradiction—the statement that the\\nsubject consciousness was and was not the whole of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. It was only as it was asserted to be the\\nwhole that any ground was found for Subjective Idealism;\\nbut only as it was regarded as a remainder left over from\\nsubtraction of the object world does it correspond to actual\\nexperience. Now you have yourself fallen into precisely this\\ncontradiction. You do but state that the individual°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness is and is not the universal consciousness. Only so far as\\nit is not, do you escape Subjective Idealism; only so far as it\\nis, do you escape the thing-in-itself. If this universal°con-sciousness\\n ― 139 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness is not for our individual consciousness, if it is not\\na part of our conscious experience, it is unknowable, a\\nthing-in-itself. But if it be a part of our individual°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, then after all the individual consciousness is the°ulti-mate\\nultimate. By your own argument you have no choice except\\nbetween the acceptance of an unknowable unrelated reality\\nor of Subjective Idealism.\"\\nThis objection amounts to the following disjunction:\\nEither the universal consciousness is the individual and we\\nhave Subjective Idealism; or, it is something beyond the\\nindividual consciousness, and we have a thing-in-itself. Now\\nthis dilemma looks somewhat formidable, yet its statement\\nshows that the objector has not yet put himself upon the\\npsychological ground: there is something of the old°\"onto-logical\\n\"ontological\" man left in him yet, for it assumes that he has, prior\\nto its determination by Psychology, an adequate idea of\\nwhat \"individual\" is and means. If he will take the°psycho-logical\\npsychological standpoint, he will see that the nature of the°individ-ual\\nindividual as well as of the universal must be determined within\\nand through conscious experience. And if this is so, all\\nground for the disjunction falls away at once. This°disjunc-tion\\ndisjunction rests upon the supposition that the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness are something opposed to each\\nother. If one were to assert that the meaning of the°individ-ual\\nindividual consciousness is that it is universal, the whole objection\\nloses not only its ground but its meaning; it becomes°non-sense\\nnonsense. But I am not concerned just at present to state this; I\\nam concerned only to point out that, if one starts with a\\npresupposition regarding the nature of the individual°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, one is leaving the psychological standpoint. In\\nforming the parallel between the position attributed to the\\nwriter and that of Subjective Idealism, the supposed°objec-tor\\nobjector was building wiser than perhaps he knew. The trouble\\nwith the latter view is that it supposes that consciousness\\nmay be divided into \"two kinds,\" one subjective, the other\\nobjective; that it presupposes, at the start, the nature of\\nsubject and object. The fact of the case is that, since°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness is the unity of subject and object, there is no\\npurely subjective or purely objective. So here. It is°presup-posed\\npresupposed that there are \"two kinds\" of consciousness, one°indi-vidual\\n ― 140 ―\\n                            \\nindividual, the other universal. And the fact will be found to be,\\nI imagine, that consciousness is the unity of the individual\\nand the universal; that there is no purely individual or\\npurely universal. So the disjunction made is meaningless.\\nBut however that may be, at all events it leaves the°psycho-logical\\npsychological basis, for it assumes that the nature of the individual\\nis already known.\\nThis has been said that it may be borne in mind from\\nthe outset that Psychology must determine within°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness the nature of the individual and the universal°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness, thereby determining at once their place within°experi-ence\\nexperience, and explicating the nature of consciousness itself. And\\nthis, stated in plain terms, means simply that, since°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness does show the origin of individual and universal\\nconsciousness within itself, consciousness is therefore both\\nuniversal and individual. How this is, the present°arti-cle\\narticle, of course, does not undertake to say. Its more modest\\nfunction is simply to point out that it is the business of\\nPsychology to show the nature of the individual and the\\nuniversal and of the relation existing between them. These\\nmust not be presupposed, and then imported bodily to°deter-mine\\ndetermine the nature of psychologic experience. There has now\\nbeen rendered explicit what was implied concerning the\\npsychological standpoint from the first, viz., that it is a\\nuniversal standpoint. If the nature of all objects of°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical inquiry is to be determined from fixing their place\\nwithin conscious experience, then there is no criterion°out-side\\noutside of or beyond or behind just consciousness itself. To\\nadopt the psychological standpoint is to assume that°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness itself is the only possible absolute. And this is\\ntacitly assumed all the while by Subjective Idealism. The\\nmost obvious objection to Subjective Idealism is, of course,\\nthat it presupposes that, if \"mind were to become extinct,\\nthe annihilation of matter, space, time would result.\" And\\nthe equally obvious reply of Subjective Idealism is: \"My\\nconception of the universe even though death may have\\novertaken all its inhabitants, would not be an independent\\nreality, I should merely take on the object-consciousness of a\\nsupposed mind then present\" (Bain, p. 682). In short, the\\nreality of the external world, though I should imagine all\\n\\n ― 141 ―\\n                            \\nfinite minds destroyed, would be that I cannot imagine°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness destroyed. As soon as I imagine an external\\nworld, I imagine a consciousness in relation to which it\\nexists. One may put the objection from a side which gets\\nadded force with every advance of physical science. The\\nsimplest physiology teaches that all our sensations originate\\nfrom bodily states-that they are conditioned upon a nervous\\norganism. The science of biology teaches that this nervous\\norganism is not ultimate but had its origin; that its origin lies\\nback in indefinite time, and that as it now exists it is a result\\nof an almost infinite series of processes; all these events,\\nthrough no one knows how much time, having been°prece-dent\\nprecedent to your and my mind, and being the condition of their\\nexistence. Now is all this an illusion, as it must be, if its only\\nexistence is for a consciousness which is \"but a transition\\nfrom one state to another\"? The usual answer to this°argu-ment\\nargument is that it is an ignoratio elenchi: that it has°presup-posed\\npresupposed a consciousness for which these events existed; and\\nthat they have no meaning except when stated in terms of\\nconsciousness. This answer I have no call to rebut. But it\\nmust be pointed out that this is to suppose the individual\\nconsciousness capable of transcending itself and assuming a\\nuniversal standpoint—a standpoint whence it can see its own\\nbecoming, as individual. It is this implication of the°univer-sal\\nuniversal nature of the individual consciousness which has°consti-tuted\\nconstituted the strength of English philosophy; it is its lack of\\nexplication which has constituted its weakness. Subjective\\nIdealism has \"admitted of no answer and produced no°con-viction\\nconviction\" because of just this confusion. That which has\\nadmitted of no answer is the existence of all for°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness; that which has produced no conviction is the existence\\nof all for our consciousness as merely individual. English\\nphilosophy can assume its rightful position only when it has\\nbecome fully aware of its own presuppositions; only when it\\nhas become conscious of that which constitutes its essential\\ncharacteristic. It must see that the psychological standpoint\\nis necessarily a universal standpoint and consciousness°nec-essarily\\nnecessarily the only absolute, before it can go on to develop the\\nnature of consciousness and of experience. It must see that\\nthe individual consciousness, the consciousness which is but\\n\\n ― 142 ―\\n                            \\n\"transition,\" but a process of becoming, which, in its°pri-mary\\nprimary aspect, has to be defined by way of \"contrast,\" which\\nis but a \"part\" of conscious experience, nevertheless is when\\nviewed in its finality, in a perfectly concrete way, the°univer-sal\\nuniversal consciousness, the consciousness which has never become\\nand which is the totality; and that it is only because the\\nindividual consciousness is, in its ultimate reality, the°uni-versal\\nuniversal consciousness that it affords any basis whatever for\\nphilosophy.\\nThe case stands thus: We are to determine the nature\\nof everything, subject and object, individual and universal,\\nas it is found within conscious experience. Conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience testifies, in the primary aspect, my individual self is a\\n\"transition,\" is a process of becoming. But it testifies also\\nthat this individual self is conscious of the transition, that it\\nknows the process by which it has become. In short, the\\nindividual self can take the universal self as its standpoint,\\nand thence know its own origin. In so doing, it knows that it\\nhas its origin in processes which exist for the universal self,\\nand that therefore the universal self never has become.°Con-sciousness\\nConsciousness testifies that consciousness is a result, but that it\\nis the result of consciousness. Consciousness is the°self-re-lated\\nself-related. Stated from the positive side, consciousness has shown\\nthat it involves within itself a process of becoming, and that\\nthis process becomes conscious of itself. This process is the\\nindividual consciousness; but, since it is conscious of itself, it\\nis consciousness of the universal consciousness. All°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness, in short, is self-consciousness, and the self is the\\nuniversal consciousness, for which all process is and which,\\ntherefore, always is. The individual consciousness is but the\\nprocess of realization of the universal consciousness through\\nitself. Looked at as process, as realizing, it is individual\\nconsciousness; looked at as produced or realized, as°con-scious\\nconscious of the process, that is, of itself, it is universal°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness.\\nIt must not be forgotten that the object of this paper is\\nsimply to develop the presuppositions which have always\\nbeen latent or implicit in the psychological standpoint. What\\nhas been said in the way of positive result has been said,\\ntherefore, only as it seemed necessary to develop the°mean-ing\\n ― 143 ―\\n                            \\nmeaning of the standpoint. It must also be remembered that it is\\nthe work of Psychology itself to determine the exact and\\nconcrete relations of subject and object, individual and°uni-versal\\nuniversal within consciousness. What has been said here, if\\nsaid only for the development of the standpoint, is therefore\\nexceedingly formal. To some of the more concrete problems\\nI hope to be able to return at another time.\\n\\n ― 144 ―\\n                            \\nPsychology as Philosophic Method [First published in Mind, XI (Apr. 1886), 153-73.

XI (Oct. 1886): 478-94  (print edition, pp. xli-lvii).]\\n»*\\nIn an article on \"The Psychological Standpoint\" [pp.\\n122-43], I endeavored to point out that the characteristic\\nEnglish development in philosophy—the psychological°move-ment\\nmovement since Locke—had been neither a \"threshing of old\\nstraw,\" nor a movement of purely negative meaning, whose\\nsignificance for us was exhausted when we had learned how\\nit necessarily led to the movement in Germany—the so-\\ncalled \"transcendental\" movement. Its positive significance\\nwas found to consist in the fact that it declared°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness to be the sole content, account and criterion of all\\nreality; and psychology, as the science of this consciousness,\\nto be the explicit and accurate determination of the nature of\\nreality in its wholeness, as well as the determination of the\\nvalue and validity of the various elements or factors of this\\nwhole. It is the ultimate science of reality, because it°de-clares\\ndeclares what experience in its totality is; it fixes the worth and\\nmeaning of its various elements by showing their°develop-ment\\ndevelopment and place within this whole. It is, in short, philosophic\\nmethod. But that paper was necessarily largely negative, for\\nit was necessary to point out that as matter of fact the\\nmovement had not been successful in presenting psychology\\nas the method of philosophy, for it had not been true to its\\nown basis and ideal. Instead of determining all, both in its\\ntotality and its factors, through consciousness, it had°en-deavored\\nendeavored to determine consciousness from something out of\\nand beyond necessary relation to consciousness. It had°deter-mined\\ndetermined its psychology from a dogmatically presupposed°on-tology\\nontology, instead of getting at its ontology from a critical\\nexamination of the nature and contents of consciousness, as\\n\\n ― 145 ―\\n                            \\nits standpoint required. It had a thing-in-itself, something\\nwhose very existence was to be opposed to consciousness, as\\nin the unknowable \"substances\" of Locke, the transcendent\\nDeity of Berkeley, the sensations or impressions of Hume\\nand Mill, the \"transfigured real\" of Spencer; and it used this\\nthing-in-itself as the cause and criterion of conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. Thus it contradicted itself; for, if psychology as\\nmethod of philosophy means anything, it means that nothing\\nshall be assumed except just conscious experience itself, and\\nthat the nature of all shall be ascertained from and within\\nthis.\\nIt is to the positive significance of psychology as°philo-sophic\\nphilosophic method—its significance when it is allowed to develop\\nitself free from self-contradictory assumptions—that this\\npresent paper is directed. It was suggested in the previous\\npaper that this method, taken in its purity, would show\\nsubstantial identity with the presuppositions and results of\\nthe \"transcendental\" movement. And as the principal°at-tacks\\nattacks upon the pretensions of psychology to be method for\\nphilosophy, or anything more than one of the special°sci-ences\\nsciences, have come from representatives of this movement,\\nthis paper must be occupied with treating psychology in\\nreference to what we may call German philosophy, as the\\nother treated it in reference to English philosophy. In so far\\nas the criticisms from this side have been occupied with\\npointing out the failure of the actual English psychology to\\nbe philosophy, there is of course no difference of opinion.\\nThat arises only in so far as these criticisms have seemed\\n(seemed, I repeat) to imply that the same objections must\\nhold against every possible psychology; while it seems to the\\nwriter that psychology is the only possible method.\\nIt is held, or seems to be held, by representatives of the\\npost-Kantian movement, that man may be regarded in two\\naspects, in one of which he is an object of experience like\\nother objects: he is a finite thing among other finite things;\\nwith these things he is in relations of action and reaction,\\nbut possesses the additional characteristic that he is a°know-ing\\nknowing, feeling, willing phenomenon. As such, he forms the\\nobject of a special science, psychology, which, like every\\nother special science, deals with its material as pure object,\\n\\n ― 146 ―\\n                            \\nabstracting from that creative synthesis of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, self-consciousness, through which all things are and are\\nknown. It is therefore, like all the special sciences, partial\\nand utterly inadequate to determining the nature and°mean-ing\\nmeaning of that whole with which philosophy has to deal. Nay\\nmore, it is itself ultimately dependent upon philosophy for\\nthe determination of the meaning, validity and limits of the\\nprinciples, categories and method which it unconsciously\\nassumes. To regard psychology therefore as philosophic\\nmethod is to be guilty of the same error as it would be to\\nregard the highest generalizations of, say, physics, as°ade-quate\\nadequate to determining the problems of philosophy. It is an\\nattempt to determine the unconditioned whole,°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness, by that which has no existence except as a°condi-tioned\\nconditioned part of this very whole.\\n\\nMetaphysics (says Professor Caird) has to deal with°con-ditions\\nconditions of the knowable, and hence with self-consciousness or that\\nunity which is implied in all that is and is known. Psychology has\\nto inquire how this self-consciousness is realised or developed in\\nman, in whom the consciousness of self grows with the°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness of a world in time and space, of which he individually is\\nonly a part, and to parts of which only he stands in immediate\\nrelation. In considering the former question we are considering\\nthe sphere within which all knowledge and all objects of°knowl-edge\\nknowledge are contained. In considering the latter, we are selecting\\none particular object or class of objects within this sphere. . . .\\nIt is possible to have a purely objective anthropology or°psychol-ogy\\npsychology—which abstracts from the relation of man to the mind that\\nknows him—just as it is possible to have a purely objective science\\nof nature.

With this infinite,\\n\\n ― 147 ―\\n                            \\nuniversal self-consciousness, philosophy deals; with man as\\nthe object of experience, psychology deals.\\nIn stating the position of the post-Kantian movement, I\\nused the word seemed, and used it advisedly, as I do not\\nconceive that at bottom there is any difference of opinion.\\nBut it seems to me that there are invariably involved in the\\nreasonings of this school certain presuppositions regarding\\nthe real science of psychology which, probably for the°rea-son\\nreason that the writers have seen such misuse made of a false\\npsychology, are not distinctly stated, and which,°accord-ingly\\naccordingly, not only lessen the convincing force with which their\\nreasonings are received by those unacquainted with the°ne-cessity\\nnecessity and rationality of these presuppositions, but which\\nalso, as not distinctly thought out, tend at times to involve\\nthese reasonings in unnecessary obscurity and even°contra-dictions\\ncontradictions. It is these presuppositions regarding the nature of a\\nreal psychology, lying at the basis of all the work of the\\npost-Kantian school, conditioning it and giving it its worth,\\nwhich it is the object of this paper to examine.\\nThe start is made accordingly from the supposed°dis-tinction\\ndistinction of aspects in man\\'s nature, according to one of\\nwhich he is an object of experience and the subject of\\npsychology, and according to the other of which, he, as\\nself-consciousness, is the universal condition and unity of all\\nexperience, and hence not an object of experience. As I have\\nalready referred to Professor Adamson\\'s treatment of this\\ndistinction, let me refer to a later writing of his which seems\\nto retract all that gave validity to this distinction. In a recent\\nnumber of Mind (vol. ix, p. 434), after pointing out that the\\nsubject-matter of psychology cannot be pure objects but\\nmust always be the reference of an individual subject to a\\ncontent which is universal, he goes on with the following\\nmost admirable statement:\\n\\nIt is in and through the conscious life of the individual that\\nall the thinking and acting which form the material for other\\ntreatment is realised. When we isolate the content and treat it as\\nhaving a quasi-existence per se, we are in the attitude of objective\\nor natural science. When we endeavour to interpret the°signifi-cance\\nsignificance of the whole, to determine the meaning of the connective\\nlinks that bind it together, we are in the attitude of philosophy.\\n\\n ― 148 ―\\n                            \\nBut when we regard the modes through which knowledge and\\nacting are realised in the life of an individual subject, we are in\\nthe position of the psychological inquirer.\\nNow, when psychology is defined as the science of the°reali-zation\\nrealization of the universe in and through the individual, all\\npretence of regarding psychology as merely one of the°spe-cial\\nspecial sciences, whose subject-matter by necessity is simply\\nsome one department of the universe, considered out of\\nrelation to the individual, is, of course, abandoned. With\\nthis falls, as a matter of course, the supposed two-fold°char-acter\\ncharacter of man\\'s nature. If the essence of his nature is to be the\\nrealization of the universe, there is no aspect in which, as\\nman, it appears as a mere object or event in the universe.\\nThe distinction is now transferred to the two ways of°look-ing\\nlooking at the same material, and no longer concerns two°dis-tinct\\ndistinct materials. Is this distinction, however, any more valid?\\nIs there any reason for distinguishing between the modes\\nthrough which the universe is realized in an individual, and\\nthe significance of this universe as a whole? At first sight\\nthere may appear to be, but let us consider the following\\nquestions. Does the whole have any significance beyond\\nitself? If we consider experience in its absolute totality so far\\nas realized in the individual, can the \"significance of the\\nwhole\" be determined beyond what itself testifies to as a\\nwhole; and do the \"connective links which bind together\"\\nhave any \"meaning\" except just as they do bind together?\\nAnd since this whole and these connective links are given to\\nus by the science of psychology, what is this except°com-pleted\\ncompleted philosophic method, and what more has philosophy to\\ndo except to abstract from this totality, and regard it, on its\\nmaterial side, as philosophy of nature, and on its formal as\\nreal logic? Psychology, as science of the realization through\\nthe individual of the universe, answers the question as to the\\nsignificance of the whole, by giving that whole, and at the\\nsame time gives the meaning of the parts and of their\\nconnection by showing just their place within this whole.\\nIt would be fatal to the existence of philosophy as well\\nas of psychology to make any distinction here. Were not the\\nuniverse realized in the individual, it would be impossible\\n\\n ― 149 ―\\n                            \\nfor the individual to rise to a universal point of view, and\\nhence to philosophize. That the universe has not been°com-pletely\\ncompletely realized in man is no more an objection to the°em-ployment\\nemployment of psychology as the determination of the nature of\\nthis universe, than it is to any treatment of philosophy\\nwhatever. In no way can the individual philosophize about a\\nuniverse which has not been realized in his conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. The universe, except as realized in an individual, has\\nno existence. In man it is partially realized, and man has a\\npartial science; in the absolute it is completely realized, and\\nGod has a complete science. Self-consciousness means°sim-ply\\nsimply an individualized universe; and if this universe has not\\nbeen realized in man, if man be not self-conscious, then no\\nphilosophy whatever is possible. If it has been realized, it is\\nin and through psychological experience that this realization\\nhas occurred. Psychology is the scientific account of this\\nrealization, of this individualized universe, of this°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness. What other account can be given? It is the object\\nof this paper to show that no other account can be given. Not\\nonly is any final distinction or dualism, even of aspects, in\\nman\\'s nature utterly untenable, but no distinction even of\\naspects can be made in the treatment of man\\'s nature.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology has to do with just the consciousness which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes man\\'s experience, and all further determinations of\\nexperience fall within this psychological determination of it,\\nand are hence abstract. More definitely, Psychology, and not\\nLogic, is the method of Philosophy. Let us deal seriatim\\nwith these two questions.\\nI.\\n\\nNo such distinction in the nature of man, as that in one\\naspect he is \"part of the partial world,\" and hence the\\nsubject of a purely natural science, psychology, and in°an-other\\nanother the conscious subject for which all exists, the subject\\nof philosophy, can be maintained. This is our first assertion.\\nLet us turn again to that most lucid and comprehensive\\nstatement of philosophic doctrine by Professor Caird, from\\nwhich extract has already been made. The distinction to be\\nupheld is that between the \"sphere in which all knowledge\\n\\n ― 150 ―\\n                            \\nand all objects of knowledge are contained\" and \"one°partic-ular\\nparticular object within this sphere.\" The question which at once\\narises is, How does this distinction come about? Granted\\nthat it is valid, how is man known as requiring in his nature\\nthis distinction for his proper comprehension? There is but\\none possible answer: it is a distinction which has arisen\\nwithin and from conscious experience itself. In the course of\\nman\\'s realization of the universe there is necessitated this\\ndistinction. This distinction therefore falls within the sphere\\nof psychology, and cannot be used to fix the position of\\npsychology. Much less can psychology be identified with\\nsome one aspect of experience which has its origin only\\nwithin that experience which in its wholeness constitutes the\\nmaterial of psychology. The distinction, as we shall°immedi-ately\\nimmediately see, cannot be an absolute one: by no possibility or\\ncontingency can man be regarded as merely one of objects of\\nexperience; but so far as the distinction has relative validity\\nit is a purely psychological one, originating because man in\\nhis experience, at different stages of it, finds it necessary to\\nregard himself in two lights,—in one of which he is a°partic-ular\\nparticular space- and time-conditioned being (we cannot say\\nobject or event) or activity, and in the other the°uncondi-tioned\\nunconditioned eternal synthesis of all. At most the distinction is only\\none of various stages in one and the same experience, both of\\nwhich, as stages of experience—one, indeed, of experience in\\nits partiality and the other of experience in its totality—fall\\nwithin the science of experience, viz., psychology.\\nWe will see how the question stands if we state it\\notherwise. Does or does not the self-consciousness of man\\nfall within the science of psychology? What reason can be\\ngiven for excluding it? Certainly few would be found so\\nthorough-going as to deny that perception is a matter which\\nthat science must treat; those however who admit perception\\nwould find themselves hard put to it to give a reason for\\nexcluding memory, imagination, conception, judgment,°rea-soning\\nreasoning. Why having reached the stage of reasoning, where\\nthe original implicit individual with which we began has\\nbeen broken up into the greatest possible number of explicit\\nrelations, shall we rule out self-consciousness where these\\nrelations are again seen united into an individual unity?\\n\\n ― 151 ―\\n                            \\nThere is no possible break: either we must deny the°possi-bility\\npossibility of treating perception in psychology, and then our\\n\"purely objective science of psychology\" can be nothing\\nmore than a physiology; or, admitting it, we must admit\\nwhat follows directly from and upon it-self-consciousness.\\nSelf-consciousness is indeed a fact (I do not fear the word)\\nof experience, and must therefore find its treatment in°psy-chology\\npsychology.\\nBut this is not all. Not only does self-consciousness\\nappear as one of the stages of psychological experience, but\\nthe explanation of the simplest psychological fact-say one\\nof perception, or feeling, or impulse—involves necessary\\nreference to self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is°in-volved\\ninvolved in every simpler process, and no one of them can be\\nscientifically described or comprehended except as this°invo-lution\\ninvolution is brought out. In fact, their comprehension or°expla-nation\\nexplanation is simply bringing to light this implication of°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness within them. This would be the last thing that\\nthe upholders of self-consciousness as the final unity and\\nsynthesis, the absolute meaning of experience, could deny.\\nThe organic nature of self-consciousness being their thesis,\\nit must indeed reveal itself in, or rather constitute, each of\\nits members and phases. The very existence of any idea or\\nfeeling being ultimately its relation to self-consciousness,\\nwhat other account of it can be given except its organic\\nplacing in the system? If there be such an act as perception,\\na candid, careful examination of it, not of its logical°condi-tions\\nconditions, but of itself as matter of experienced fact, will reveal\\nwhat it is; and this revelation will be the declaration of its\\nrelation to that organic system which in its wholeness is\\nself-consciousness. We may then abstract from this relation,\\nwhich constitutes its very being, and consider it as an object\\nof perception, and, generalizing the case, produce a°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy of nature; or, considering it as conditioned by thought,\\nwe may thus produce a logic. But both of these proceedings\\ngo on in abstraction from its real being, and cannot give the\\nreal method of philosophy. In short, the real esse of things is\\nneither their percipi, nor their intelligi alone; it is their\\nexperiri. Logic may give us the science of the intelligi, the\\nphilosophy of nature of the percipi, but only psychology can\\n\\n ― 152 ―\\n                            \\ngive us the systematic connected account of the experiri,\\nwhich is also in its wholeness just the°experior—self-con-sciousness\\nexperior—self-consciousness itself.\\nWe may see how the matter stands by inquiring what\\nwould be the effect upon philosophy if self-consciousness\\nwere not an experienced fact, i.e., if it were not one actual\\nstage in that realization of the universe by an individual\\nwhich is defined as constituting the sphere of psychology.\\nThe result would be again, precisely, that no such thing as\\nphilosophy, under any theory of its nature whatever, is\\npossible. Philosophy, it cannot be too often repeated,°con-sists\\nconsists simply in viewing things sub specie æternitatis or in\\nordine ad universum. If man, as matter of fact, does not\\nrealize the nature of the eternal and the universal within\\nhimself, as the essence of his own being; if he does not as\\none stage of his experience consciously, and in all stages\\nimplicitly, lay hold of this universal and eternal, then it is\\nmere matter of words to say that he can give no account of\\nthings as they universally and eternally are. To deny,°there-fore\\ntherefore, that self-consciousness is a matter of psychological\\nexperience is to deny the possibility of any philosophy.\\nWhat the denial comes to we have had historically\\ndemonstrated in Kant. He admits perception and conception\\nas matters of experience, but he draws the line at self-\\nconsciousness. It is worth noticing that his reason for denying\\nit is not psychological at all, but logical. It is not because\\nself-consciousness is not a fact, but because it cannot be a\\nfact according to his logical presuppositions. The results\\nfollowing the denial are worthy of notice as corresponding\\nexactly to what we might be led to expect: first, with the\\ndenial of the fact of self-consciousness comes the°impossibil-ity\\nimpossibility of solving the problem of philosophy, expressed in the\\nsetting up of an unknown thing-in-itself as the ultimate\\nground and condition of experience; and, secondly, comes\\nthe failure to bring perception and conception into any°or-ganic\\norganic connection with experience, that is, the failure to\\nreally comprehend and explain them, manifested in the°limi-tation\\nlimitation of both perception, through the forms of space and\\ntime, and thinking, through the categories, to phenomena\\nwhich are in no demonstrable connection with reality. The\\n\\n ― 153 ―\\n                            \\nfailure to recognize self-consciousness as a stage of°psycho-logical\\npsychological experience leads not only to a failure to reach the\\nalternate synthesis of experience, but renders it impossible\\nto explain the simpler forms of psychological experience.\\nThis failure of Kant teaches us another lesson also, in that,\\nas already stated, it was due to abandoning his real method,\\nwhich was psychological, consisting in the self-knowledge of\\nreason as an organic system by reason itself, and setting up\\na logical standard (in this latter case the principles of non-\\ncontradiction and identity), by which to determine the°total-ity\\ntotality of experience. The work of Hegel consisted essentially in\\nshowing that Kant\\'s logical standard was erroneous, and\\nthat, as matter of logic, the only true criterion or standard\\nwas the organic notion, or Begriff, which is a systematic\\ntotality, and accordingly able to explain both itself and also\\nthe simpler processes and principles. That Hegel°accom-plished\\naccomplished this work successfully and thoroughly there can be\\nto the writer no doubt; but it seems equally clear that the\\nwork of Kant is in need of another complement, following\\nmore closely his own conception of method and of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy, which shall consist in showing self-consciousness as a\\nfact of experience, as well as perception through organic\\nforms and thinking through organic principles. And it\\nseems further that, only when this has been done, will, for\\nthe first time, the presuppositions latent in the work of\\nHegel, which give it its convincing force and validity, be\\nbrought out.\\nAgain, it seems worthy of note, that the late Professor\\nGreen (of whom the writer would not speak without°ex-pressing\\nexpressing his deep, almost reverential gratitude), when°fol-lowing\\nfollowing out Kant\\'s work from its logical side, hardly escaped\\nKant\\'s negative results. (By Kant\\'s logical method we mean\\nthe inquiry into the necessary conditions of experience; by\\nhis psychological method the inquiry into the actual nature\\nof experience.) After his complete demonstration of°con-sciousness\\nconsciousness as the final condition, synthesis and unity of all\\nthat is or is knowable, he finds himself obliged to state\\n(Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, p. 54): \"As to what that\\nconsciousness in itself or in its completeness is, we can only\\nmake negative statements. That there is such a°conscious-ness\\n ― 154 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness is implied in the existence of the world; but what it is\\nwe can only know through its so far acting in us as to enable\\nus, however partially and interruptedly, to have knowledge\\nof a world or an intelligent experience.\" Had he begun from\\nthe latter statement, and shown as matter of fact that this\\nuniversal consciousness had realized itself, though only\\npartially and interruptedly, in us, he certainly would have\\nbeen able to make very positive statements regarding it, and\\nwould also have furnished a basis in fact for his logical\\nmethod, which now seems to hang upon nothing but a unity\\nof which all that can be said is that it is a unity, and that it is\\nnot anything in particular. When one reflects that it is not\\nonly upon the existence of this unity, but upon its working in\\nand through us, that all philosophy and philosophizing°de-pend\\ndepend, one cannot conceal the apprehension that too great a\\nload of philosophy has been hung upon too feeble a peg.\\nSo, too, after his victorious demonstration that upon\\nthe existence of this spiritual unity depends the possibility of\\nall moral experience, he finds himself obliged to state\\n(Green, p. 180), with that candor so characteristic of all his\\nthinking: \"Of a life of completed development, of activity\\nwith the end attained, we can only speak or think in°nega-tives\\nnegatives, and thus only can we speak or think of that state of\\nbeing in which, according to our theory, the ultimate moral\\ngood must consist.\" Once more, had he started from the fact\\nthat as matter of actual realization this absolute good has\\nbeen reproduced in our lives and the end attained (for surely\\nthe good is a matter of quality and not of quantity, and the\\nend a power, not a sum), he would not have found himself in\\nthis difficulty. But with a purely logical method, one can end\\nonly with the must be or the ought: the is vanishes, because\\nit has been abstracted from. The psychological method\\nstarts from the is, and thereby also gives the basis and the\\nideal for the ought and must be.\\nBut it is time that we returned to our thesis, which, in\\nbrief, was that no distinction which maintains that°psychol-ogy\\npsychology is the science of man as \"part of this partial world\" can\\nbe maintained. The following reasons for this denial have\\nbeen given: it was pointed out that the relative validity\\nwhich this distinction in man\\'s nature undoubtedly possesses\\n\\n ― 155 ―\\n                            \\nis itself the product and manifestation of psychological°expe-rience\\nexperience; that man as man, or as the conscious experience\\nwhose science is psychology, is self-conscious, and that\\ntherefore self-consciousness as the unity of subject and°ob-ject\\nobject, not as \"purely objective,\" as the totality, not as a\\n\"part,\" must be included in the science of psychology; and\\nthat furthermore this treatment of self-consciousness is°nec-essary\\nnecessary for the explanation and comprehension of any partial\\nfact of conscious experience. And finally, it was pointed out\\nthat the denial of self-consciousness as constituting matter of\\nexperience, and hence of psychology, was the denial of the\\npossibility of philosophy itself; and this was illustrated by\\nhistoric examples. Before passing on to the second topic, I\\nwish briefly to return to Professor Caird\\'s exposition, and\\nshelter myself somewhat beneath the wings of his authority.\\nIn the article already referred to, he goes on to state that the\\nnatural objective science of man after all \"omits the°distinc-tive\\ndistinctive characteristic of man\\'s being\"; that while we may treat\\ninorganic nature and even organic with purely natural°objec-tive\\nobjective methods and principles, because \"they are not unities\\nfor themselves, but only for us,\" such treatment cannot be\\napplied to man, for man is for himself, i.e., is not a pure\\nobject, but is self-consciousness. Thus, he continues (Caird,\\n\"Metaphysic,\" p. 89):\\n\\nIn man, in so far as he is self-conscious—and it is self-\\nconsciousness that makes him man—the unity through which all\\nthings are and are known is manifested. . . . Therefore to treat\\nhim as a simply natural being is even more inaccurate and°mis-leading\\nmisleading than to forget or deny his relation to nature altogether.\\nA true psychology must avoid both errors: it must conceive man\\nas at once spiritual and natural; it must find a reconciliation of\\nfreedom and necessity. It must face all the difficulties involved in\\nthe conception of the absolute principle of self-consciousness—\\nthrough which all things are and are known—as manifesting\\nitself in the life of a being like man, who \"comes to himself\" only\\nby a long process of development out of the unconsciousness of\\na merely animal existence.\\n\\nWhen it is stated, later on, that the natural science of man\\n\"is necessarily abstract and imperfect, as it omits from its\\n\\n ― 156 ―\\n                            \\nview the central fact in the life of the object of which it\\ntreats\" (Caird, \"Metaphysic,\" p. 92), it is hardly worth\\nwhile discussing whether there be any such science or not.\\nBut there is suggested for us in the quotation just made our\\nsecond problem-the final relation of psychology, which°con-fessedly\\nconfessedly must deal with self-consciousness, to philosophy.\\nFor there the problem of psychology was stated to be the\\nquestion of the \"absolute principle of self-consciousness,\\nmanifesting itself in the life of a being like man.\" That is, it\\nis here suggested that psychology does not deal with the\\nabsolute principle in itself, but only with the modes by\\nwhich this is manifested or realized in the life of man.\\nPsychology no longer appears as an objective science; it now\\ncomes before us as a phenomenology, presupposing a°sci-ence\\nscience of the absolute reality itself. It is to this question that I\\nnow turn. Is psychology the science merely of the°manifesta-tion\\nmanifestation of the Absolute, or is it the science of the Absolute\\nitself?\\nII.\\n\\nThe relation of Psychology to Philosophy now stands,\\nI suppose, something like this:-There is an absolute self-\\nconsciousness. The science of this is philosophy. This°abso-lute\\nabsolute self-consciousness manifests itself in the knowing and\\nacting of individual men. The science of this manifestation,\\na phenomenology, is psychology. The distinction is no\\nlonger concerned with man\\'s being itself; it is a distinction\\nof treatment, of ways of looking at the same material. Before\\ngoing to its positive consideration the following questions\\nmay suggest the result we desire to reach. How does there\\ncome about this distinction between the \"spiritual\" and the\\n\"natural,\" between \"freedom\" and \"necessity\"? How does\\nthere come into our knowledge the notion of a distinction\\nbetween the \"absolute principle of self-consciousness\" and\\n\"man coming to himself only by a long process of°de-velopment\\ndevelopment out of the unconsciousness of a merely animal\\nexistence\"? Is this a distinction which falls outside the°sub-ject\\nsubject-matter of psychology, and which may therefore be used\\nto determine it; or is it one which has originated within\\n ― 157 ―\\n                            \\npsychological experience, and whose nature therefore,°in-stead\\ninstead of being capable of fixing the character of psychology,\\nmust itself be determined by psychology? Furthermore,\\nwhat is this distinction between the absolute°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness and its manifestation in a being like man? Is the°abso-lute\\nabsolute self-consciousness complete in itself, or does it involve\\nthis realization and manifestation in a being like man? If it is\\ncomplete in itself, how can any philosophy which is limited\\nto \"this absolute principle of self-consciousness\" face and\\nsolve the difficulties involved in its going beyond itself to\\nmanifest itself in self-consciousness? This cannot be what is\\nmeant. The absolute self-consciousness must involve within\\nitself, as organic member of its very being and activity, this\\nmanifestation and revelation. Its being must be this°realiza-tion\\nrealization and manifestation. Granted that this realization and\\nmanifestation is an act not occurring in time, but eternally\\ncompleted in the nature of the Absolute, and that it occurs\\nonly \"partially\" and \"interruptedly\" through (not in) time,\\nin a being like man,—the fact none the less remains that\\nphilosophy, under any theory of its nature, can deal with\\nthis absolute self-consciousness only so far as it has partially\\nand interruptedly realized itself in man. For man, as object\\nof his philosophy, this Absolute has existence only so far as\\nit has manifested itself in his conscious experience. To°re-turn\\nreturn to our questions: If the material of philosophy be the\\nabsolute self-consciousness, and this absolute°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness is the realization and manifestation of itself, and as\\nmaterial for philosophy exists only in so far as it has realized\\nand manifested itself in man\\'s conscious experience, and if\\npsychology be the science of this realization in man, what\\nelse can philosophy in its fulness be but psychology, and\\npsychology but philosophy?\\nThese questions are stated only to suggest the end\\nwhich we shall endeavor to reach. I shall not attempt to\\nanswer them directly, but to consider first the relations of\\nPsychology to Science, and hence to Philosophy; and°sec-ondly\\nsecondly to Logic.\\n1. THE RELATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO SCIENCE.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology is the completed method of philosophy, because\\n\\n ― 158 ―\\n                            \\nin it science and philosophy, fact and reason, are one.°Phi-losophy\\nPhilosophy seems to stand in a double relation to Science. In\\nits first aspect it is a science-the highest of all sciences. We\\ntake one sphere of reality and ask certain questions°regard-ing\\nregarding it, and the answers give us some one science; we find in\\nthe process that this sphere of reality can only artificially be\\nthus isolated, and we broaden and deepen our question, until\\nfinally, led by the organic connection of science with science,\\nwe ask after the nature of all reality, as one connected\\nsystem. The answer to this question constitutes philosophy\\nas one science amid the circle of sciences. But to continue to\\nregard it in this way is to fail to grasp the meaning of the\\nprocess which has forced us into philosophy. At the same\\ntime that philosophy is seen as the completion of the°sci-ences\\nsciences, it is seen as their basis. It is no longer a science; it is\\nScience. That is to say, the same movement of thought and\\nreality which forces upon us the conception of a science\\nwhich shall deal with the totality of reality forces us to\\nrecognize that no one of our previous sciences was in strict\\ntruth science. Each abstracted from certain larger aspects\\nof reality, and was hence hypothetical. Its truth was°condi-tioned\\nconditioned upon the truth of its relations to that whole which\\nthat science, as special science, could not investigate without\\ngiving up its own independent existence. Only in this whole\\nis categorical truth to be found, and only as categorical truth\\nis found in this whole is the basis found for the special\\nsciences. Philosophy as the science of this whole appears no\\nlonger therefore as a science, but as all Science taken in its\\norganic systematic wholeness,—not merely to which every\\nso-called special science is something subordinate, but of\\nwhich it constitutes an organic member. Philosophy has no\\nexistence except as the organic living unity and bond of\\nthese sciences; they have no existence except through their\\nposition in this living synthesis.\\nNow the question is, where does psychology stand\\nwithin this organism? On the one hand, psychology is°cer-tainly\\ncertainly a positive science. It finds its materials in certain facts\\nand events. As to systematic observation, experiment,°con-clusion\\nconclusion and verification, it can differ in no essential way\\nfrom any one of them. It is based upon and deals with fact,\\n\\n ― 159 ―\\n                            \\nand aims at the ordered comprehension and explanation of\\nfact as any special science does. Yet the whole drift of this\\npaper has been to show that in some way psychology does\\ndiffer very essentially from any one of them. Where shall we\\nfind this difference? In one word, its relation to them is\\nprecisely that which we have discovered philosophy to bear:\\nit is not only a science, but it turns out to be science as an\\norganic system, in which every special science has its life,\\nand from which it must abstract when it sets up for an\\nindependent existence of its own. We begin with any special\\nscience. That turns out to be not only some one department\\nor sphere of reality, but also some one department of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. From one science to another we go,°ask-ing\\nasking for some explanation of conscious experience, until we\\ncome to psychology, which gives us an account of it, in its\\nown behalf, as neither mathematics, nor physics, nor biology\\ndoes. So far we have only a special science, though the\\nhighest and most concrete of all. But the very process that\\nhas made necessary this new science reveals also that each of\\nthe former sciences existed only in abstraction from it. Each\\ndealt with some one phase of conscious experience, and for\\nthat very reason could not deal with the totality which gave\\nit its being, consciousness. But in psychology we have the\\nmanifestation and explication of this consciousness. It gives\\nin its wholeness what each of them would give in part, viz.,\\nthe nature of experience, and hence is related to them as the\\nwhole is to the part. It appears no longer, therefore, as the\\nhighest of sciences: it appears as Science itself, that is, as\\nsystematic account and comprehension of the nature of°con-scious\\nconscious experience. Mathematics, physics, biology exist,°be-cause\\nbecause conscious experience reveals itself to be of such a\\nnature, that one may make virtual abstraction from the\\nwhole, and consider a part by itself, without damage, so\\nlong as the treatment is purely scientific, that is, so long as\\nthe implicit connection with the whole is left undisturbed,\\nand the attempt is not made to present this partial science as\\nmetaphysic, or as an explanation of the whole, as is the usual\\nfashion of our uncritical so-called \"scientific philosophies.\"\\nNay more, this abstraction of some one sphere is itself a\\nliving function of the psychologic experience. It is not\\n\\n ― 160 ―\\n                            \\nmerely something which it allows: it is something which it\\ndoes. It is the analytic aspect of its own activity, whereby it\\ndeepens and renders explicit, realizes its own nature; just as\\ntheir connection with each other is the synthetic aspect of\\nthe same self-realizing movement, whereby it returns to\\nitself: while psychology in its completeness is the whole\\nself-developing activity itself, which shows itself as the°or-ganic\\norganic unity of both synthetic and analytic movements, and\\nthus the condition of their possibility and ground of their\\nvalidity. The analytic movement constitutes the special°sci-ences\\nsciences; the synthetic constitutes the philosophy of nature; the\\nself-developing activity itself, as psychology, constitutes°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy.\\nWhat other position can be given psychology, so soon\\nas we recognize the absurdity and impossibility of°consider-ing\\nconsidering it a purely objective science? It is the science of the\\nmodes by which, in and through the individual, the universe\\nis realized, it is said. But that the universe has no existence\\nexcept as absolutely realized in an individual, i.e., except as\\nself-consciousness, is precisely the result of philosophy, and\\ncan therefore be no objection to such a consideration of the\\nuniverse: in fact, such a statement only amounts to saying\\nthat psychology considers the universe as it really is. If the\\nassertion is varied again, to read that philosophy treats of\\nthis individualized universe as it eternally is, while°psychol-ogy\\npsychology can treat of it only as it partially and interruptedly\\nbecomes, this loses sight of two very important facts. First,\\nphilosophy can treat of absolute self-consciousness only in so\\nfar as it has become in a being like man, for otherwise it is\\nnot material for philosophy at all; and, secondly, it falls into\\nthe error of regarding this realization in man as a°time-con-ditioned\\ntime-conditioned product, which it is not. Time is not something\\noutside of the process of conscious experience; it is a form\\nwithin it, one of the functions by which it organically°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes its own being. In fact, psychology as philosophic\\nmethod has an immense advantage at just this point over\\nany other method of treating this problem. To any°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy attempting to consider the absolute self-consciousness\\nby itself, it must remain for ever an insoluble problem why\\nthe is should ever appear as becoming, why the eternal\\n\\n ― 161 ―\\n                            \\nshould ever appear through the temporal. Psychology solves\\nthe problem by avoiding the assumption which makes it a\\nproblem. For, dealing with an individualized universe, one\\nof whose functions of realization is time, it knows nothing\\nabout any consciousness which is out of relation to time. The\\ncase is just here: if philosophy will deal with the absolute\\nconsciousness conceived as purely eternal, out of relation to\\ntime, then the existence of that which constitutes the actual\\ncontent of man\\'s experience is utterly inexplicable; it is not\\nonly a mystery, but a mystery which contradicts the very\\nnature of that which is, ex hypothesi, the absolute. If°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy does deal with the eternal absolute consciousness as\\nfor ever realized, yet as for ever having time as one of its\\norganic functions, it is not open to any one to bring charges\\nagainst psychology as philosophy, for this and no more\\npsychology does.\\nThe question just comes to this: If we start from\\nreason alone we shall never reach fact. If we start with fact,\\nwe shall find it revealing itself as reason. The objection to an\\naccount of fact or experience as philosophy is but a°preju-dice\\nprejudice, though historically considered a well-grounded one. On\\nthe one hand, it has arisen because some partial account of\\nexperience, or rather account of partial experience, has been\\nput forth as the totality, and just because thus put forth as\\nabsolute has lost even the relative validity which it possessed\\nas partial. Such is the procedure of Empiricism. On the\\nother hand, we have had put forth as matter of fact certain\\ntruths declared to be immediate and necessary and intuitive,\\ncoming no one knows whence and meaning no one knows\\nwhat. The aversion to immediacy, to \"undeduced\" fact, as\\ngiven us by the Intuitionalists, is certainly a well-grounded\\none. But neither of these objections lies against psychology\\nas account of the facts of experience. Men are mortal, and\\nevery actual account of experience will suffer from the°de-fects\\ndefects of mortals, and be but partial, no doubt; unfortunately\\nwe are none of us omniscient yet. But the very essence of\\npsychology as method is that it treats of experience in its\\nabsolute totality, not setting up some one aspect of it to\\naccount for the whole, as, for example, our physical°evolu-tionists\\nevolutionists do, nor yet attempting to determine its nature from\\n\\n ― 162 ―\\n                            \\nsomething outside of and beyond itself, as, for example, our\\nso-called empirical psychologists have done. The vice of the\\nprocedure of both is at bottom precisely the same-the°ab-stracting\\nabstracting of some one element from the organism which\\ngives it meaning, and setting it up as absolute. It is no\\nwonder that the organism always has its revenge by°pro-nouncing\\npronouncing this abstracted element \"unknowable.\" The only\\nwonder is that men should still bow in spirit before this\\ncreation of their own abstracting thought, and reverence it\\nas the cause and ground of all reality and knowledge. There\\nis indeed an anthropomorphism which is degrading, but it is\\nthe anthropomorphism which sets up the feeblest element of\\nits own thinking, pure being, as Mr. Spencer does, or the\\npoorest element of its own feeling, a sensation, and°rever-ences\\nreverences that as its own and the universe\\'s cause. That is the\\nanthropomorphism of the enslaved thought which has not\\nyet awakened to the consciousness of its own totality and\\nspiritual freedom.\\nNor does the account of fact given by psychology have\\nanything in common with the \"ultimate, inexplicable,°neces-sary\\nnecessary\" mental facts called intuitions. The fact of psychology\\nreveals itself as precisely reason, which thereby accounts for\\nitself, and in accounting for itself accounts for all its°mem-bers\\nmembers. The fact of psychology is not isolated \"truths,\" but the\\norganic system of self-consciousness. This fact is indeed\\n\"immediate,\" but it is immediate only in and through a\\nprocess, hence of mediation. It is indeed self-evidencing, but\\nwhat it evidences is simply, of the parts, relation to and\\ndependence upon the whole, and of the whole, that it is\\nself-conditioned and self-related. Of the whole fact it may be\\nsaid indeed that it is inexplicable. \"It is true that we cannot\\nexplain the spiritual principle which is implied in all°experi-ence\\nexperience by reference to anything else than itself.\" Prof. E. Caird, Mind, vol. viii, p. 560.\\n»2 \"Because\\nall we can experience is included in this one world, and all\\nour inferences and explanations relate only to its details,\\nneither it as a whole, nor the one consciousness which°consti-tutes\\nconstitutes it, can be accounted for in the ordinary sense of the\\nword. They cannot be accounted for by what they include;\\n\\n ― 163 ―\\n                            \\nand being all-inclusive, there remains nothing else by which\\nthey can be accounted for.\" Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, p. 52.\\n»3 In short, any system of°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy must ultimately fall back on the fact for which no\\nreason can be given except precisely just that it is what it is.\\nThis implication of fact The insistence upon this seems to have been Lotze\\'s great work as\\na philosopher.\\n»4 is latent in all philosophy°what-ever\\nwhatever, and all that psychology as philosophic method does is\\nto render this necessary implication explicit. It alone starts\\nfrom the completed fact, and it alone is therefore completed\\nphilosophy.\\nIf it may have seemed at times in the course of the\\ndiscussion that the nominal subject—the relation of°psychol-ogy\\npsychology to science-had been left, it will now appear, I think,\\nthat we have all the time been dealing with just that subject.\\nScience is the systematic account, or reason of fact;°Psychol-ogy\\nPsychology is the completed systematic account of the ultimate fact,\\nwhich, as fact, reveals itself as reason, and hence accounts\\nfor itself, and gives the \"reasons\" of all sciences. The other\\npoint, the relation of psychology to logic, has already been\\ndealt with by implication, and need not detain us long again.\\n2. THE RELATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO LOGIC. The whole\\ncourse of philosophic thought, so far as the writer can°com-prehend\\ncomprehend it, has consisted in showing that any distinction\\nbetween the form and the matter of philosophic truth,°be-tween\\nbetween the content and the method, is fatal to the reaching of\\ntruth. Self-consciousness is the final truth, and in°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness the form as organic system and the content as\\norganized system are exactly equal to each other. It is a\\nprocess which, as form, has produced itself as matter.°Psy-chology\\nPsychology as the account of this self-consciousness must°neces-sarily\\nnecessarily fulfil all the conditions of true method. Logic, since it\\nnecessarily abstracts from the ultimate fact, cannot reach in\\nmatter what it points to in form. While its content, if it be\\ntrue philosophy, must be the whole content of°self-conscious-ness\\nself-consciousness or spirit, its form is only one process within this°con-tent\\ncontent, that of thought-conditions, the Idee. While the content\\nis the eternal nature of the universe, its form is adequate\\n\\n ― 164 ―\\n                            \\nonly to \"thinking what God thought and was before the\\ncreation of the world,\" that is, the universe in its unreality,\\nin its abstraction. It is this contradiction between content\\nand form in logic which makes it not philosophic method,\\nbut only one moment within that method. No contradiction\\nresults as soon as logic is given its proper place within the\\nsystem. The contradiction occurs when, at the same moment\\nthat it is said that logic is \"abstract,\" the logical method is\\nstill said to be the method of philosophy.\\nSuch contradictions certainly appear to exist, for°exam-ple\\nexample, in the philosophy of Hegel. They have been often\\npointed out, and I shall only summarize them, following for\\nthe most part a recent writer. Prof. A. Seth, \"Hegel: an Exposition and Criticism,\" Mind, vol. vi.\\n»5 There is no way of getting\\nfrom logic to the philosophy of nature logically. The only\\nway is to fall back upon the fact; \"we know from°experi-ence\\nexperience\" that we have nature as well as the Idee. In truth we do\\nnot go from logic to nature at all. The movement is a reverse\\nmovement. \"In reality, the necessity for any such transition\\nis purely factitious, because the notions never existed°other-wise\\notherwise than in nature and spirit. . . . They were got by\\nabstraction from the concrete. . . . We owe, therefore, no\\napology for a return to the reality from which we took\\nthem.\" In short, it is necessity of fact, a necessity of°con-scious\\nconscious experience, which takes us from the realm of the Idee\\nto the realm of nature, from the sphere of thought-conditions\\nto the sphere of existent relations. \"The same is true when\\nwe pass to the philosophy of spirit. The general form of\\npersonality is deducible, but not a living human spirit with\\nits individual thoughts, feelings and actions.\" This remains\\n\"the incomprehensible and inexplicable point in°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy.\" And so it does undoubtedly while we regard logic as\\nmethod of philosophy. But this \"inexplicability\" is but the\\nexpress condemnation of the method, not a fact to be°con-tented\\ncontented with. If we go deeper and inquire not how is the\\ntransition from logic to the philosophy of nature or to the\\nphilosophy of spirit made, but how is any transition°what-ever\\nwhatever possible, we find the same difficulty. It exists only by\\nreason of the presupposed fact. \"We cannot in strictness say\\n\\n ― 165 ―\\n                            \\nthat the result has been independently proved, because it has\\nbeen reached in this fashion by the method. It was°presup-posed\\npresupposed in the method all along.\" In a definite case, how is the\\ntransition, say from the category of quality to that of°quan-tity\\nquantity, made? It occurs not by virtue of the category of quality\\nin itself, but by virtue of the fact that the whole Idee is\\nimplicitly contained in the principle of quality, and must\\nmanifest itself, which it does by forcing quality, as an°inade-quate\\ninadequate expression of its own nature, into quantity, which°ex-presses\\nexpresses its being more fully. And thus the process continues\\nuntil the Idee has manifested itself as the whole organic\\nsystem, which has expressed explicitly all that which in Idee\\nit is. But this movement itself depends on spirit, and on the\\nmanifestation of spirit in nature, as already seen. Every\\npurely logical transition therefore occurs at bottom because\\nof fact, i.e., seen in its wholeness it is not a logical transition\\nbut a factual. Psychology, as philosophic method, merely\\nstarts from this everywhere presupposed fact, and by so\\ndoing, for the first time, gives logic its basis and validity.\\nThere can be no escape from this result by saying that\\nafter all in the philosophy of spirit, spirit is shown to be the\\nprius and condition of the whole, as it undoubtedly is by\\nHegel himself. This merely brings the contradiction itself\\ninto clearer light. For logic, being thus confessedly°deter-mined\\ndetermined as abstract, is still retained to determine the nature of\\nthe concrete. Logic, while it is thus declared to be only one\\nmoment of spirit, is still used to determine the nature of the\\nwhole. Thus is revealed the contradiction between form and\\ncontent involved in the use of logic as the method of°philoso-phy\\nphilosophy. Spirit is reached by a logical process, and the logical\\nresult is that as fact it is not reached at all. As concrete, it is\\nbeyond the reach of any abstract process. Either one must\\ncall in the aid of the presupposed but suppressed Fact, and\\nrecognize that after all the process has been going on within\\na further and higher determination; or, failing to see this,\\nmust recognize Spirit as only one factor or moment of the\\nlogical movement, that is, give up the notion of°self-con-sciousness\\nself-consciousness as subject, and fall back into Spinozistic°panthe-ism\\npantheism. The logical movement, considered by itself, is always\\nbalancing in unstable equilibrium between dualism and.\\n\\n ― 166 ―\\n                            \\npantheism. Set up as absolute method, it either recognizes\\nthe fact, but being unable to comprehend it, has to regard\\nthis fact, as foreign element over against it, as the matter of\\nPlato and Aristotle, the thing-in-itself of Kant, and Anstoss\\nof Fichte, The inability to go from the \"because\" of reason to the \"cause\" of\\nfact, from logic to reality, when logic is not taken simply as one movement\\nwithin reality, is clearly set forth in the closing chapters of Mr. Bradley\\'s\\nPrinciples of Logic.\\n»6 or endeavors to absorb the Fact as a mere element\\nin its own logical being, and falls into Pantheism.\\nThis is the reason why Hegel, although the very centre\\nof his system is self-conditioned spirit, lends himself so\\neasily to pantheistic treatment. Logic cannot reach, however\\nmuch it may point to, an actual individual. The gathering\\nup of the universe into the one self-conscious individuality it\\nmay assert as necessary, it cannot give it as reality. It is only\\nas logic contradicts itself and faces back on the constant\\npresupposition of this reality that it can demonstrate what it\\nasserts. Taken purely by itself it must issue in a pantheism\\nwhere the only real is the Idee, and where all its factors and\\nmoments, including spirit and nature, are real only at°differ-ent\\ndifferent stages or phases of the Idee, but vanish as imperfect\\nways of looking at things, or as illusions, when we reach the\\nIdee. And thus the Idee itself vanishes, as an organic°sys-tem\\nsystem, as a unity which lives through its distinctions, and\\nbecomes a dead identity, in no way distinguishable from the\\nsubstance of Spinoza. Logic set up as absolute method°re-veals\\nreveals its self-contradiction by destroying itself. In a purely\\nlogical method the distinctions, the process must disappear\\nin the final unity, the product. Only a living actual Fact can\\npreserve within its unity that organic system of differences\\nin virtue of which it lives and moves and has its being. It is\\nwith this fact, conscious experience in its entirety, that°psy-chology\\npsychology as method begins. It thus brings to clear light of\\nday the presupposition implicit in every philosophy, and\\nthereby affords logic, as well as the philosophy of nature, its\\nbasis, ideal and surety. If we have determined the nature of\\nreality, by a process whose content equals its form, we can\\nshow the meaning, worth and limits of any one moment of\\nthis reality.\\nThe conclusion of the whole matter is that a \"being\\n\\n ― 167 ―\\n                            \\nlike man,\" since self-conscious, is an individualized°uni-verse\\nuniverse, and hence that his nature is the proper material of\\nphilosophy, and in its wholeness the only material.°Psychol-ogy\\nPsychology is the science of this nature, and no dualism in it, or in\\nways of regarding it, is tenable. Whatever the dualism may\\nbe, it is only relative, and one which occurs within, not\\nwithout, psychological experience. Psychology, as the°com-plete\\ncomplete systematic account of man, at the same time shows the\\nvalue and meaning, and affords the condition, of the special\\nsciences, the philosophy of nature and of logic. Or, in a\\nword, if the reality of spirit be the presupposition, the prius\\nand the goal, the condition and the end of all reality, the\\nscience of spirit must occupy a corresponding position with\\nrelation to all science. Surely then, as the editor of this\\njournal formerly urged, \"the method of psychological°ap-proach\\napproach is not philosophically valueless,\" and we have\\n\"ground for the belief that it has only to be more°systemati-cally\\nsystematically followed out for the attaining of as great results as\\nhave been claimed for another way, while in this way the\\nresults are more likely to secure general acceptance,\" George Croom Robertson, \"Psychology and Philosophy,\" Mind, vol.\\nviii, p. 20.\\n»7—°be-cause\\nbecause, we may add, it simply expresses in a scientific way\\nthat which lies at the basis of all that has been otherwise\\nsecured.\\n\\n ― 168 ―\\n                            \\n\"Illusory Psychology\" [First published in Mind, XII (Jan. 1887), 83-88.

XI (Oct. 1886): 478-94  (print edition, pp. xli-lvii).]\\n»*\\nThe fact that so acute and experienced a philosophical\\nthinker as Mr. Shadworth Hodgson has misapprehended the\\nbearing of the articles by me [pp. 122-43 and 144-67]\\nmust be my excuse for again troubling the readers with\\nreference to the matters discussed there. Mr. Hodgson\\nseems to think that it was the object of one to explain the\\nnature of the individual and the universal consciousness, and\\nof the other to give some definite directions regarding the\\napplication of method to philosophy and psychology. Thus\\napprehending them, he quite naturally complains of the\\n\"blanks\" in the argument; and, if I may judge from the tone\\nof his remarks, thinks, indeed, that there is not so much an\\nargument as an assumption, while my lack of logic is to him\\nlamentable. May I be allowed to state that I had no such\\nends in view, and that what seems to Mr. Hodgson a lack of\\nlogic on my part seems to me a misunderstanding of logical\\nbearing on his part? The logical purpose of the first article\\nwas as follows: Granted the general truth of that way of\\nlooking at philosophical questions which is specifically°Eng-lish\\nEnglish (and which, following the usual custom, I called°psy-chological\\npsychological), (1) to determine whether some important°fac-tor\\nfactor has not been overlooked; (2) to show that it is involved\\nin this standpoint that all questions must be decided from\\ntheir place in conscious experience; (3) to show that this\\ngeneral statement applies to particular questions, like the\\nnature of subject and object, universal and individual; and\\n(4) to show that this in turn implies that the psychological\\nstandpoint is one which transcends and underlies the°distinc-tion\\ndistinction of subject and object, etc. Now it was open to Mr.\\nHodgson, or anyone else, to reply that I misinterpreted the\\nstandpoint of British philosophy; or that, while its°stand-point\\n ― 169 ―\\n                            \\nstandpoint was correctly stated, it involved no such implications\\nas I thought it did; or that while it did involve such°implica-tions\\nimplications, this fact is, at bottom, only a reductio ad absurdum of\\nthe standpoint. But objections like those of Mr. Hodgson,\\nwith all due deference, seem to me a huge ignoratio elenchi.\\nAnd his misunderstanding of the logical bearing of the\\nwhole has influenced his treatment of details. Mr. Hodgson\\'s\\naversion to some expressions is so acute that he seems hardly\\nto have asked himself in what connection these phrases are\\nused. If he will re-read certain pages of the article referred\\nto, I think he will see that the terms \"postulate\" and°\"pre-supposition\\n\"presupposition,\" whose use seems to him to involve a°contradic-tion\\ncontradiction on my part, are used not generally, nor with reference\\nto my own standpoint, but in connection with this°examina-tion\\nexamination of British philosophy, and that the contention of the\\narticle is, rather, that what has been an unconscious°presup-position\\npresupposition ought to be given a psychological examination and\\nposition.\\nSo the logical bearing of the second article was not to\\ngive recommendations regarding specific methods, but to\\nsuggest to those whom Mr. Hodgson calls my°\"Germanis-ing\\n\"Germanising friends\" that their results will never have a firm basis\\nuntil they are reached by a psychological method. The°arti-cle\\narticle was entitled \"Psychology as Philosophic Method,\" just\\nas Mr. Hodgson might call a portion of his article°\"Meta-physic\\n\"Metaphysic as Philosophic Method.\"\\nIt thus appears to me that the mass of Mr. Hodgson\\'s\\ndirect specific criticism is so beside the mark that it is\\nneedless to undertake a detailed review of it. But one may\\nalways learn much from Mr. Hodgson when he is positively\\npropounding his own views; and certain discussions, as,\\ne.g., regarding the nature of the universal and the°individ-ual\\nindividual, and the mutual connections of science, philosophy and\\npsychology, are never beside the mark. I should like briefly\\nto discuss the attempts which Mr. Hodgson kindly makes to\\nfill the \"blanks\" in my argument.\\nI.\\n\\nFirst, then, as to the relation of the individual and the\\nuniversal consciousness, or, more properly speaking, of the\\n\\n ― 170 ―\\n                            \\nindividual and the universal in consciousness. The position\\nof Mr. Hodgson, as I understand it, is that I have not duly\\ndistinguished between perceptual processes, which give us\\nthe individual, and conceptual processes, which generalize it\\nand give us a result more or less abstract, and that°conse-quently\\nconsequently I have erected a generalized notion of my individual\\nconsciousness,—a logical abstraction into an actual ens,\\nwhich I call universal consciousness (pp. xliii and xlvii [print edition]).\\nThe real state of the case, we are to believe, is as follows:\\nThere is a \"stream of states and changes\" which comes to\\nevery individual; this is an individualized stream, and occurs\\nin perceptual order. Out of it the world of ordinary°experi-ence\\nexperience is built. But the individual can think as well as°per-ceive\\nperceive, and he comes gradually to generalize. This process of\\ngeneralization he extends even to his own consciousness; he\\ngeneralizes conscious experience itself. But the°generaliza-tion\\ngeneralization does not give, either in knowledge or belief, a universal\\nconsciousness different in any way from his own. It is\\nmerely the logical or conceptual way of representing°individ-uality\\nindividuality of what in actual experience is perceptual (pp. xliii\\nand xlvi [print edition]). A universal self can only be represented in\\nthought as an individual self indefinitely or infinitely°magni-fied\\nmagnified (p. xlix). The result is that, while we may speak of\\nuniversal knowledge, the content of consciousness, it is°falla-cious\\nfallacious and self-contradictory to speak of a universal knower,\\nthe agent or bearer of consciousness (pp. xlvii and xlviii [print edition]).\\nThe gist of the whole controversy is, that while we may and\\nmust assume individuality as given to us (pp. xlii, xlvi [print edition]),\\nuniversality is the result of a logical process. As to this I\\nhave to say:—\\n1. Mr. Hodgson is misled by an ambiguity in the use\\nof the term \"individual.\" In one sense (in which it cannot be\\nthe subject-matter of any science) it is given to us; in\\nanother (in the sense in which it is an object of scientific\\nknowledge) it is not given to us, but is a product of°psycho-logical\\npsychological experience. Every experience is given to us as a\\nunique experience, a fact of absolute and immediate interest.\\nIndividuality in this sense is indeed an assumption which we\\nneed not care to avoid. But this assumption is only the\\nassumption that a fact exists; it tells us nothing of the\\n\\n ― 171 ―\\n                            \\nmeaning of the fact. And it is the assumption that we know\\nat the outset, what individuality means, and that the°imme-diate\\nimmediate fact of experience is the same as an interpretation of\\nthe fact, which plays such havoc with Mr. Hodgson\\'s ideas.\\nIt is this assumption which enables him to slide°uncon-sciously\\nunconsciously from the immediate unique interest which°accompa-nies\\naccompanies every experience, and which makes it mine or thine, to\\nthe fact of individuality, as one being among others, limited\\nin space and time, and whose ideas occur as a \"stream.\"\\nIndividuality in this sense is not \"given,\" is not°\"immedi-ate\\n\"immediate,\" and is an assumption which we must avoid making\\nuntil we see what it means—until, in short, it is not an\\nassumption. Individuality in this sense may be provisionally\\nopposed to universality, but this sense is not an original or\\nimmediate dictum. It is a product which has come about\\nthrough experience, through psychological experience. The\\nprocess of its coming about, the way in which this gets to be\\na fact of our conscious experience, is something to be°exam-ined\\nexamined by psychology. The psychological standpoint is prior,\\nso to speak, to this result. It is confusion enough to°substi-tute\\nsubstitute this psychological product for the immediate°individual-ity\\nindividuality which is a matter of feeling, but to substitute a°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical interpretation of the fact is to carry the confusion a\\nstep further. And this Mr. Hodgson does in giving°individu-ality\\nindividuality a meaning—that is, an interpretation-which opposes it\\nabsolutely to universality. One thing which Mr. Hodgson\\nwould have learned by going to psychology rather than to\\nmetaphysics would be to avoid this threefold confusion of\\nthe individuality of immediate feeling, of constructed fact of\\nexperience and of philosophical interpretation of the fact.\\n2. The substitution appears, however, in a still worse\\nplight when we consider that this view of individuality\\nwhich opposes it absolutely to universality is an incorrect\\ninterpretation. I speak, not as a Germanizing°transcenden-talist\\ntranscendentalist, but according to my humble lights as a psychologist,\\nwhen I say that I know nothing of a perceptual order apart\\nfrom a conceptual, and nothing of an agent or bearer apart\\nfrom the content which it bears. As a psychologist, I see the\\npossibility of abstractly analyzing each from the other, and,\\nif I were as fond of erecting the results of an analysis into\\n\\n ― 172 ―\\n                            \\nreal entities as Mr. Hodgson believes me to be, I should\\nsuppose that they were actually distinct as concrete°exist-ences\\nexistences. But, sticking fast to what Psychology teaches me, I\\nmust hold that they are aspects, analytically arrived at, of\\nthe one existing reality-conscious experience. Mr. Hodgson\\nfinds no difficulty in making the separation. He assumes—\\nand speaking from the metaphysical standpoint would°natu-rally\\nnaturally assume—that there is \"a stream of changes and states\"\\nwhich \"come to an individual,\" and \"out of this as data is\\nbuilt up ordinary experience.\" So he regards this \"stream\"\\nas in some way individual, while the world built up out of it\\n—the content—may be distinguished from it. To me it seems\\nthat this \"stream\" is built up along with, and mostly out of,\\nthe experiences of the everyday world. Stream and world are\\nequally psychological constructions, built up by°psychologi-cal\\npsychological processes. It must be from Metaphysic (it cannot be\\nfrom Psychology) that Mr. Hodgson gets a \"stream\" which\\nis given ready-made. Psychology would tell us that the\\n\"stream\" is essentially due to projections out from the°pres-ent\\npresent by a psychological mechanism in the form of memory\\nand expectation. Consciousness is not a moving body, which,\\nflying through time, leaves a trail behind it, as does a rocket\\nin space. When the idea of an absent person is suggested to\\nan infant, the child does not conceive this as an idea, but\\nlooks about him to localize the person. His life is a present\\none, and it is only through a psychological development that\\nhe comes to have experiences placed as past and anticipated\\nas future. The experiences of time and of \"streams\" are due\\nto psychological dynamics. The process by which the°indi-vidual\\nindividual comes to connect certain experiences with himself as\\na being continuous in time, and to separate them from others\\nwhich he refers to existences in space, is one of the problems\\nof psychology. What is the bearing of all this? Simply, that\\nwe have no ready-made distinction between the individual\\nagent and the world of experience over against him, but that\\neach is built up out of a common material by°contempora-neous\\ncontemporaneous processes. A correct psychology would teach Mr.\\nHodgson, it seems to me, not only that the ordo ad°individ-uum\\nindividuum and the ordo ad universum are built out of a common\\nstock, but that the process is a reciprocal one, so that our\\n\\n ― 173 ―\\n                            \\nideas of ourselves as individuals, nay ourselves as°individu-als\\nindividuals, are made up out of our experiences of the world, and\\nvice versa. The agent is not the agent which it is without the\\ncontent, not only in the sense that it bears that content and\\nno other, but in the sense that this content reacts upon it and\\nis organized into it to make it what it specifically is. If Mr.\\nHodgson will make an absolute separation between the°indi-vidual\\nindividual as agent and the content of consciousness as general,\\nhe will find that all that is left to the agent is: x is°experi-enced\\nexperienced and is interesting, where it is impossible to give x any\\ndefinite values. Its analogies we may hypothetically find in\\nthe consciousness of an oyster.\\n3. And finally upon this point, I know of no perception\\nwhich is not made what it is by conceptual elements within\\nit. Mr. Hodgson well says that \"every act of attention to a\\npercept is the commencement of a generalisation\" (p. xliv [print edition]).\\nBut it cannot be possible that Mr. Hodgson supposes that\\nperceptions are given to us prior to attention, and that this is\\nan activity which supervenes, the perception once formed.\\nCorrect psychology seems to teach that the attention—the\\nactive connection between the mind and a given psychical\\ncomplex-is necessary to interpret, to make it a percept. And\\nunless there are two utterly different kinds of attention,\\ngeneralization must be thus introduced, and a universal\\nelement be present in the percept. I cannot believe°accord-ingly\\naccordingly that Mr. Hodgson\\'s attempt to set up individuality of\\nconsciousness as opposed to universality is successful,\\nwhether it proceeds by distinguishing the perceptual order\\nfrom the conceptual, or by distinguishing the stream of\\nconsciousness as given from the content of that°conscious-ness\\nconsciousness as interpreted. At all events, I hope it is clear that this\\nconception of universality of consciousness is not that of an\\nindividual indefinitely magnified. I should still be compelled\\nto ask, What is this individual which is magnified? and if I\\ndeal with facts and not with analytic abstractions, I find it to\\nbe bound up through and through with universal factors,\\nnay constituted by its relation to the universal factor. One\\nword more, and I have done with this point. The°universal-ity\\nuniversality of consciousness stands just where its individuality does.\\nAn individuality is \"given\" in the sense that every°con-sciousness\\n ― 174 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness has a unique interest; so universality is \"given\"\\nin the sense that every consciousness has a meaning. But the\\nexperience of the world as a fact, like the experience of the\\nindividual stream as a fact, is a constructed product. And\\nthe philosophical interpretation of the fact that there is a\\nworld of experience is still more remote from being°immedi-ate\\nimmediate or given. In each of these three stages it stands just\\nwhere individuality does.\\nII.\\n\\nI can treat but briefly of the other point: the relation\\nbetween Psychology and what Mr. Hodgson calls°Meta-physic\\nMetaphysic and what I called Logic. Mr. Hodgson seems to think\\nthat upon my theory no place can be left for physiological\\npsychology, for race-psychology, etc., etc. They would,\\nhowever, be left just where they are now-as special°meth-ods\\nmethods for determining the conditions and genesis of various\\nfactors in conscious experience.\\nWhen Mr. Hodgson says that Metaphysic abstracts\\nfrom the fact that consciousness is individually conditioned\\n(pp. liii and lv [print edition]) he simply suggests the point which was\\nuppermost in my mind when I wrote the article on°\"Psychol-ogy\\n\"Psychology as Philosophic Method.\" Metaphysic or Logic does\\nabstract from the individual, which conditions the content.\\nAs thus abstract, it cannot furnish the final method of°philos-ophy\\nphilosophy, for as abstract it makes an assumption and is°incom-plete\\nincomplete. It is incomplete; for is this unique and yet absolutely\\nuniversal fact that the content of consciousness is known\\nonly in and to an individual-is this fact to be left out of\\naccount? The play of Hamlet, with Hamlet left out seems to\\nme nothing in comparison. It makes an assumption, for to\\nmake assumptions is simply to see how facts look when some\\nintegral factor is omitted.\\nEnglish thought, according to Mr. Hodgson, has°com-monly\\ncommonly ignored the universal or all-embracing character of\\nthe consciousness, and has identified it with individual\\nbeing. So it seems to me, and the article [pp. 122-43] was\\nwritten to show that psychology could not be even°psychol-ogy\\npsychology, much less philosophy, until the universal factor in\\n\\n ― 175 ―\\n                            \\nconsciousness was attended to. Transcendentalism, he says,\\ninclines to identify consciousness with universal being, and\\nif this be interpreted to mean that it inclines to neglect the\\nindividual agent, without which the universality of the°con-tent\\ncontent is naught, I heartily agree with him. The article [pp.\\n144-67] was written to show that transcendentalism was\\nincomplete till it recognized that the universal content can\\nbe realized only in an individual bearer. And I make bold to\\nadd that Mr. Hodgson thinks the two sides may be split, one\\nsurrendered to Psychology, the other reserved for°Meta-physic\\nMetaphysic; while to me it seems that we shall never get the\\nsurest footing and the completest results until we recognize\\nthat such halves—the individual without the universal°con-tent\\ncontent, and the universal content without the individual bearer\\n—are disjecta membra. The science which unites them, and\\nconsiders the content as realized in and by an individual, and\\nthe individual as realized through and by the content, seems\\nto me to be Psychology. A psychology which should attempt\\nto occupy the position Mr. Hodgson gives to it would have\\nnothing to say except—Here is a consciousness which°inter-ests\\ninterests me, but about which I can say nothing.\\n\\n ― 176 ―\\n                            \\nKnowledge as Idealization [First published in Mind, XII (July 1887), 382-96. Not reprinted\\nby the author.]\\n»*\\nThat the word \"idea,\" as commonly used, is about as°am-biguous\\nambiguous a term as could well be invented, is an old story. I\\nneed here to call attention only to two connotations. It°im-plies\\nimplies existence, and it implies meaning or the content of the\\npsychical existence. When we speak of the idea of virtue, we\\nmay mean either the \"idea conveyed\" by the term, its°signif-icance\\nsignificance, or we may mean the particular psychical existence,\\nwhich occurs now and here in experience, and stands for the\\nmeaning. But this double connotation is not confined to\\nabstract terms. It holds equally of the most definite°percep-tion\\nperception,—say, mine of my pen as I write. There is the idea \"in\\nmy mind,\" an existence coming after many ideas, and before\\nmany others; a psychical existence which is a unique,°un-shareable\\nunshareable, irrecoverable experience. What constitutes it we\\nneed not here inquire, though our psychological research\\ngoes to show that it is a clustering of sensations, visual,\\nmuscular and tactile, due to the immediate stimulation of\\nmy nervous system. Similar stimuli may occur again°doubt-less\\ndoubtless, but the present existence endures only while the given\\nstimulus is actually there. How stands it with the other\\nconnotation of the term? It is evident that here we are\\ndealing with meaning or significance—all that would be\\nincluded in the definition, say, of pen, plus the fact that it is\\nnow present, which is, after all, part of the meaning, and not\\nof the existence. To state the whole matter simply, every\\npsychical state or \"idea,\" in Locke\\'s sense, is at once°sensa-tion\\nsensation and interpretation of that sensation or meaning°con-veyed\\nconveyed. It is sign and signification. We do not go here into\\nthe theoretical justification of the latter element. We do not\\nask whether there is any pen really there, or whether, if there\\n\\n ― 177 ―\\n                            \\nis, our idea of it corresponds to reality. We merely state the\\nfact that in every psychical experience there is the psychical\\nexistence, and there is what this existence stands for to the\\nmind. It is an undoubted fact that the meaning seems to be\\nobjective, permanent and universal; that the idea of°exist-ence\\nexistence, in other words, seems to us to report a reality which is\\nthere, aside from our particular mental state, one which is\\nequally there for my intelligence at all times under the same\\nconditions and for all intelligences. This apparent report is\\npart of the complete psychical fact, but we do not now ask\\nwhether it has any right to be, or whether it is an illusion\\nunconsciously superadded to the legitimate content of the\\nfact. Recognizing that every psychical fact does have these\\ntwo aspects, we shall, for the present, confine ourselves to\\nasking the nature, function and origin of the aspect of°mean-ing\\nmeaning or significance—the content of the idea as opposed to its\\nexistence. In thus calling attention to the distinction of the two senses of the\\nterm \"idea,\" I am, of course, but repeating what many others have said\\n—among them most clearly Mr. F. H. Bradley, in his Principles of Logic,\\npp. 5 and 6.\\n»1\\nTo develop what is meant let us take Locke\\'s favorite\\nexample—a perception of gold. If we ask what is psychically\\npresent, by way of immediate existence, we shall find that it\\nis only a group of sensuous feelings—some strong, some\\nfaint. If we inquire further, we find that the stronger ones\\nare due to a direct stimulation of some organ of sense, while\\nthe fainter are due to the indirect stimulation of some central\\norgan. If we simply look at the piece of gold, there are the\\nvivid sensations of color and muscular tension only;°clus-tered\\nclustered about these may be less vivid feelings of contact,\\nperhaps of slight metallic taste and odor. But it is a mistake\\nto call these latter feelings ideal, and the former real. One\\nclass is just as real as the other; the only distinction is one of\\nstrength. It is quite true that the weaker feelings may be\\nfound upon examination to be due to previous stimulations,\\nand to be due to connections in the brain previously°estab-lished\\nestablished, so that now a direct peripheral excitation serves to set\\nup a change in some connected part of the brain and awaken\\nsensation. But as existences, there is no difference in the\\n\\n ― 178 ―\\n                            \\nfeelings, whether peripherally set up or centrally excited.\\nThe stronger one, as existence, does not report that it is due\\nto present direct stimulation; the weaker one does not report\\nthat it is ultimately due to past stimulations. This is a matter\\nof interpretation, and even as interpretation it does not enter\\ninto the perception of the gold. I repeat, as existence, we\\nhave only a clustering of sensuous feelings, stronger and\\nweaker.\\nBut what is perceived is not a clustering of feelings of\\nany sort. It has taken centuries of scientific psychological\\nobservation even to ascertain that sensations of these kinds\\nare involved at all: so far is their presence from being an\\nelement of the content of perception. What is perceived is\\nthe thing gold, with its various properties, which the°sensa-tions\\nsensations stand for. And in our anxiety to get at meaning, to find\\nout what is symbolized, we actually neglect utterly that\\nwhich is the symbol, the psychical existence. What is°per-ceived\\nperceived is, in short, significance, meaning. The amount of\\nperception one has, whether as a babe or adult, as layman,\\nor as chemist, is precisely the meaning that one finds°signi-fied\\nsignified by one\\'s sensations: the sensations, as such, may be\\nprecisely alike in the four cases. Perceiving, to restate a\\npsychological commonplace, is interpreting. The content of\\nthe perception is what is signified.\\nNow, it is to be noted that the meaning constitutes for\\nus the whole value of the experience. As a physiological fact,\\nthe occurrence of nerve tremors of some sort may be the\\nimportant thing. But as a fact of human experience, the\\nimportant thing is that the experience has significance. It\\nmeans something to us. It reports something to our°intelli-gence\\nintelligence. Absolute nonsense and nonentity are synonymous as\\nmatters of conscious experience. It is true enough that°with-out\\nwithout the idea as existence there would be no experience; the\\nsensuous clustering is a condition sine qua non of all, even\\nthe highest spiritual, consciousness. But it is none the less\\ntrue that if we could strip any psychical existence of all its\\nqualities except bare existence, there would be nothing left,\\nnot even existence, for our intelligence. Even the fact that\\nthere is an experience, aside from what it is, is not the\\nsensation itself; it is the interpretation of the sensation. It is\\n\\n ― 179 ―\\n                            \\npart of the meaning. If we take out of an experience all that\\nit means, as distinguished from what it is—a particular\\noccurrence at a certain time, there is no psychical°experi-ence\\nexperience. The barest fragment of consciousness that can be hit\\nupon has meaning as well as being. Take away the meaning,\\nand consciousness vanishes.\\nWe may seem to be dwelling needlessly upon the°veri-est\\nveriest truism of psychology-that its subject-matter is°con-scious\\nconscious experience, for that is all that is really meant when we\\nsay that significance constitutes the worth of an idea. But,\\nperhaps because it is such a truism, there is no fact so often\\noverlooked. The fundamental distinction between physical\\nfacts and psychical facts is not that the former exist in space,\\nthe latter in time, or any other specific distinction of mode of\\noccurrence. It is that physical facts as such are facts of\\nexistence; psychical facts are facts of meaning. Physical\\nfacts have meaning, but they have it as psychical, in relation\\nto intelligence; psychical facts have existence, but the°exist-ence\\nexistence does not constitute their express value in human°experi-ence\\nexperience. An idiot has as many ideas, qua existences, as°Shake-speare\\nShakespeare; the delirious patient has, in all probability, more in a\\ngiven time than his physician.\\nWhat then is the nature of meaning, of significance, of\\nthat which is conveyed by every fact of consciousness, and\\nwhich constitutes the value of that fact? It is, of course, a\\nmediate factor; it is due to inference. In passing, I must\\ncommend this statement to those who are telling us that the\\nonly realities which we can ultimately admit are those which\\nare immediately present in some state of consciousness, and\\nthat we must reject all inference if we are to get the fact. For\\nmy part, it seems that when the mediate element is gone,\\nmeaning is gone, and consciousness itself disappears. If\\nsomeone takes away from me all the inference contained in a\\nfact, hunt as hard as I will, I cannot find but that he has\\ntaken with him the fact also. He may have left me with\\nnervous tremors in my brain, but all significance, i.e.,°con-scious\\nconscious experience, is gone. So far is it from being true that\\nwe know only what is immediately present in consciousness,\\nthat it should rather be said that what is immediately°pres-ent\\npresent is never known.\\n\\n ― 180 ―\\n                            \\nBut we must leave these general statements and come\\nto particulars. That which is immediately present is the\\nsensuous existence; that which is known is the content°con-veyed\\nconveyed by this existence. The sensuous material is of worth\\nonly as it is a sign; it is a sign only as it signifies or points\\nout meaning. This meaning is present as mediated. It is not\\nthere as existence; it is there as pointed towards, as°symbol-ized\\nsymbolized. If we owe nothing else to what is called physiological\\npsychology, the experimental result reached by Helmholtz,\\nthat we always neglect sensations, or pay no attention to\\nthem as existence, in behalf of the meaning conveyed by\\nthem, gives physiological psychology a higher scientific\\nstand than introspective psychology has yet attained; for\\nintrospective psychology is always descriptive, while°Helm-holtz\\nHelmholtz\\'s generalization explains. It is true, for example, that\\nevery experience of tone is complex, containing the°funda-mental\\nfundamental and the partials. Yet we are entirely unconscious of\\nthis complexity, which as matter of sensuous existence is the\\nall-important thing. Why? Because this complexity is taken\\nsolely as a sign of the instrument to which the tone is\\nreferred-human voice, violin, piano. We interpret the°var-ious\\nvarious combinations of sensations as signifying this or that\\nobject. We are equally unconscious of the nature of the\\nsensations in themselves, and of the process we go through.\\nPsychical result or significance is all intelligence cares for.\\nStarting-point and way to this result are swallowed up in\\nwhat they symbolize. This explains \"unconscious°cerebra-tion\\ncerebration\" on its psychical side. Processes, whether of perception\\nor of reasoning, are of no account to intelligence except as\\nthey lead to meaning. Perception is well defined as°uncon-scious\\nunconscious reasoning. And as such it illustrates the way in which\\nthe process loses itself in the result. The process is nothing\\nas a process, or psychical existence; it is everything in what\\nit means or symbolizes. In reasoning proper, the processes\\nare of some account to us, because we know that upon\\nvariations in the process depend variations in result. The\\nmatter is more complex, and we go through it step by step;\\nbut even here we do not pay attention to the process as an\\nexistence. We simply take one meaning at a time, and then\\ngo on to the next meaning. Reasoning is the way in which\\n\\n ― 181 ―\\n                            \\nwe separate and unite meanings into one complex meaning.\\nAs our power to reason becomes developed, and the subject-\\nmatter becomes familiar, we cease considering the various\\nsubordinate meanings in their relation to each other. We\\ngrasp the meaning as a whole, as we do in perception, and\\nreasoning becomes, as we say, automatic or intuitive.°Con-versely\\nConversely, when we are in doubt in perception as to whether\\nthe result is genuine or is an illusion, we do pay attention to\\nthe process. We repeat the process, analyzing it into its\\nsteps, to see if we have drawn a correct inference. So, when\\nwe wish to decide whether that red color is really on the wall\\nor is due to a purely organic affection, we move the body or\\nhead, and observe results, and draw our inference°accord-ingly\\naccordingly. We often separate the various steps in perception,\\njust as we often consolidate them in reasoning; but the\\nseparation and the consolidation are always of meaning, and\\nnever of the psychical process as an existence.\\nBut let us consider another example or two of the fact\\nthat we neglect sensuous basis and regard meaning alone.\\nEveryone knows that we have two retinal images of an\\nobject in every case of binocular vision; that is to say, we\\nhave two complete sensuous outfits. In the vast majority of\\ncases, these two sensuous bases are slightly different; in one\\ncase in a thousand they may be alike. Yet we are ordinarily\\nconscious of but one object; in some cases, those where the\\nretinal images are similar, we can be conscious of but one,\\ndo what we will. I know of no more striking illustration of\\nthe fact that sensations, as existences, are nothing for us,\\nwhile sensations in their symbolic function are for us°every-thing\\neverything. The sensations mean but one object, and, do what we\\nwill, we see but one object. The duality of the sensation is\\nnothing for us. But we neglect the greater part of the case,\\nwhen we speak of the matter as if it were confined to a few\\nspecial cases of eye and ear, and as if in these cases the\\nsensations, as existences, were only double, or triple or\\nquadruple. In fact, as existences, they are indefinitely°multi-ple\\nmultiple in every case. As I touch the table, how many distinct\\nsensations do I have? As the ray of light affects my retina,\\nconsider what a chaos of sensations is stimulated. I may\\nremark incidentally that a large number of the psychologists\\n\\n ― 182 ―\\n                            \\nwho have occupied themselves with the problem of space-\\nperception do not seem to have realized the elements of the\\nproblem. They first talk as if the problem were: How to get\\nspace-relations out of sensations, as existences? and°sec-ondly\\nsecondly, as if the problem were: Given isolated sensations as\\nequivalent to isolated points in space, to tell how these come\\nto be connected with each other in complex space-forms?\\nBut the problem in the first place is: How do we interpret\\nsensations into spatial meanings? and secondly: How do we\\ninterpret some sensations as isolated points and others as\\nconnected bodies? We do not start with separate points\\nwhich are to be combined through the medium of motion, or\\nin any other way. The separate point is as much an°infer-ence\\ninference, an interpretation of the sensation, as the connected\\nline, surface, or solid. Our experience of one is built up\\nalong with that of the other. Sensations, as existences, in\\nspatial perceptions as in all perceptions, are naught;°sensa-tions\\nsensations, in their symbolic quality, as inference is put into them\\nand they become meaning, are all.\\nOur fundamental position is that sensation, as°exist-ence\\nexistence, and the process, as psychical occurrence, by which\\nsensations are connected, never enter into knowledge.\\nKnowledge is both the sensation and the process in their\\nsignificant or sign-bearing quality.\\nBut what is the sense in calling the sign-borne content\\ninferential, and in separating it from the sensational basis as\\nimmediate? The general ground is the fact that the sensuous\\nclustering is all that is present by way of immediate°exist-ence\\nexistence, and it is convenient to have a term to express that\\nwhich is present by way of being signified or symbolized.\\nThe sensuous basis stands for, conveys to intelligence, the\\ncontent of the experience, and the meaning is present only as\\nthus represented. The sensations, as immediate existences,\\nhave no more meaning than letters of the alphabet or than\\nvocal noises. The meaning is read into them or out of them,\\nas one may prefer to state it. But more specifically, this\\nelement may be called mediate or inferential because it is\\npresent as the result of a process of reasoning. There is no\\nneed at this time, I suppose, to do more than state the fact\\nthat every perception is a judgment based on an inference. It\\n\\n ― 183 ―\\n                            \\nis indifferent to the sensation whether it is interpreted as a\\ncloud or as a mountain; a danger-signal, or a signal of open\\npassage. The auditory sensation remains unchanged\\nwhether it is interpreted as an evil spirit urging one to\\nmurder, or as intra-organic, due to disordered°blood-pres-sure\\nblood-pressure. The result is arrived at by a process of inference. It is\\nnot the sensation in and of itself that means this or that\\nobject; it is the sensation as associated, composed, identified,\\nor discriminated with other experiences; the sensation, in\\nshort, as mediated.  The whole worth of the sensation for\\nintelligence is the meaning it has by virtue of its relation to\\nthe rest of experience. Since the rest of experience is not and\\ncannot be present as so much immediate existence, we may\\nwell call the element which gives any psychical fact its value\\nmediate.\\nWe have just been introduced to some terms which,\\nindeed, it has long been difficult to keep in the background;\\nterms like \"identification,\" \"discrimination,\" \"relation.\"\\nFor this mediate element is precisely what we mean by\\nrelation, and the processes by which it is got at, and read\\ninto the sensation, are those of association and comparison.\\nIt has long seemed to me a remarkable fact that the later\\nwriters of the specifically British school of psychology, led\\nby Mr. Spencer, recognize this truth and yet do not think it\\nnecessary to revise their fundamental notions of intelligence.\\nI can account for it only on the supposition that they do not\\nattend to the double sense of the term \"idea.\" Their general\\ntheory of intelligence, as at bottom sensational, requires that\\nit be the sensations as existences which are compared and\\nrelated. Their theory, as it actually works, is that the°sensa-tions\\nsensations in their intellectual quality, as significances, are°com-pared\\ncompared and identified. Their theory as they employ it for\\npurposes of explanation is in direct contradiction to their\\ntheory in its fundamental presuppositions. If all intelligence\\nis a product of psychical existences, called sensations, plus\\ntheir association and comparison, no amount of association\\nand comparison will ever give a result which has meaning\\nfor consciousness. Strictly speaking, it is impossible for such\\nprocesses to occur. But if the comparison of sensations does\\nresult in significant experience, there must be a certain\\n\\n ― 184 ―\\n                            \\nintellectual quality in the sensations not due to their°prop-erties\\nproperties as bare existences. A relation of identity is not a\\nsensuous skeleton which runs through psychical occurrences\\nand ribs them together. It is identity of meaning;°perma-nence\\npermanence, in short, of intelligence.\\nAnd discrimination is not the introduction of°unlike-ness\\nunlikeness between ideas as occurrences in the psychical life. They\\nare already as unlike as they can be, each being already a\\nunique distinct existence: as Hume says, every distinct idea\\nis a separate existence. Nor can it mean recognition of this\\nunlikeness of existence, except in the sense that it is°recog-nized\\nrecognized that the two psychical occurrences do not mean the\\nsame. They may be unlike, but we should never know they\\nwere did we not discover that they did not point to or\\nsymbolize the same intellectual content. They must mean\\ndifference of times at least, and conscious experience of\\ndifference of times is just as much a matter of interpretation\\nof sensations as recognition of spatial differences is.\\nWundt has shown clearly enough, as it seems to me,\\nthat association is finally a function of attention; but, not to\\nconfuse ourselves with terms, let us take a simple example.\\nOf all the sensations which, as existences, are presented to\\nus at any one time, how many come into consciousness\\ntogether? To put it in the old-fashioned way, how many\\nideas can we be conscious of at once? To answer the°ques-tion\\nquestion in this form: Of idea in the sense of meaning, we can be\\nconscious of but one; of idea in the sense of existence, or\\npsychical occurrence due to separate stimulation, we may be\\nconscious of an indefinite, limitless number. Just as many as\\ncan be made to convey one meaning, just so many may be\\ncomprehended in one idea. If we make, for the sake of\\nexample, the assumption that the universe is a unity, it is\\ntheoretically possible to grasp every detail of the universe in\\none idea. In fact, it must be so grasped, for the unity of the\\nworld can only mean that it ultimately possesses oneness of\\nmeaning.\\nIn any given complex of presentations, therefore, just\\nas much will be selected and united into a conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience as harmonizes in meaning. The astronomer cannot\\nattend to the ticking of the clock and to the passage of a star\\n\\n ― 185 ―\\n                            \\nat the same time, because they are interpreted in two°differ-ent\\ndifferent ways. Were they interpreted in the same content of\\nsignificance, they would be, ipso facto, members of the same\\nexperience. To borrow Wundt\\'s illustration, if the eye sees a\\nfalling rod at one place, and there is a noise made at a slight\\ndistance, and if the noise occurs regularly after the rod falls,\\nalthough there is no connection between them, the sight of\\nthe rod and the sound will be united in the same idea. So\\nineradicable is the mind\\'s bent after meaning, that it will\\nforce it, if it be possible. In case, however, the noise is not\\nharmoniously related to the fall of the rod, the mind will\\nhave to alternate between the two facts. They cannot both be\\npresent in the same consciousness. Their unlike significance\\nmakes them, by necessity, two distinct consciousnesses.\\nUnity and difference, relation in short, is always a\\nmatter of significance, of content for intelligence, and not of\\npsychical existence. When we say then, as Mr. Spencer and\\nall the later English writers do say, that a sensation is\\nnothing until it is identified and discriminated-that is,\\nbrought into relations of unity and difference-it is°neces-sary\\nnecessary to remember that the identification and the°discrimina-tion\\ndiscrimination are elements of meaning, of relation to intelligence. The\\nsensations, or existences, never unite themselves, and never\\ndifferentiate themselves. But sensations, as they exist in\\nconscious experience, are always united and differentiated.\\nWhat is this but to say that intelligence is necessarily°in-volved\\ninvolved in every sensation as known, and, therefore, that it is\\nimpossible to derive intelligence from any combination of\\nsensations? Let us remember two things: first, a sensation is\\nnot knowledge until united and differentiated; secondly,\\nthese processes have absolutely no reference to the existence\\nof the sensations, but only to their significance, to the°mean-ing\\nmeaning conveyed by them. Can we avoid drawing the°conclu-sions\\nconclusions: negatively, that relations—that is, connections of\\nunity and difference of meaning—can never be produced by\\nsensations as psychical existences; and, positively, that the\\nfactor of relation—or ideal significance-is necessarily°re-quired\\nrequired to make sensations elements of conscious experience?\\nThis brings us to the fact that relations are thoroughly\\nideal. Lewes frequently noted that science is a process of\\n\\n ― 186 ―\\n                            \\nidealization, but he seems never to have realized either the\\ntrue import of idealization, or the fact that all knowledge,\\nperception included, requires the ideal element. Idealization\\nis not a process of departure from the material presented in\\nperception, for this material is itself ideal. The idealization\\nof science is simply a further development of this ideal\\nelement. It is, in short, only rendering explicit and definite\\nthe meaning, the idea, already contained in perception. In\\nthe act of perception we do not realize anything like the\\nwhole meaning of what the sensations convey; our°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation is fragmentary and inadequate. The other processes of\\nknowledge, the so-called faculties of memory, conception,\\njudgment, self-consciousness, etc., are only progressively\\nfuller interpretations, as each introduces some ideal factor—\\nthat is, relation—neglected by the previous. Memory, for\\nexample, simply makes explicit that ideal relation of our\\npresent experience to past experiences, which is involved in\\nevery perception, and which indeed makes it what it is,\\nalthough in the stage of perception we are not conscious of\\nthis relation. Self-consciousness, again, is simply the°con-scious\\nconscious recognition that the ideal element is involved in all\\nknowledge together with what is implied in this statement.\\nSelf-consciousness is the idealizing process of all knowledge\\ncontinued till it becomes conscious of itself. But these are\\naspects of the question that must now be deferred.\\nWe have to ask what is the especial ground for calling\\nthe element which makes knowledge significant an ideal\\nelement? The answer in general is that this factor is ideal,\\nbecause it is not present by way of immediate psychical\\noccurrence, but as meaning. It is significance; and this is\\nsignificance, presence as symbolized. It is convenient to have\\na term to denote what is present in the way of meaning\\nrather than in the way of existence, and the term \"ideal\"\\njust meets the demand. It meets it negatively in suggesting\\nthat this factor is not one of space- and time-existence and\\noccurrence; it meets it positively in suggesting that it is due\\nto intelligence.\\nThis is the point which has now to be shown, and\\nshown not through an examination of the logical conditions\\nof experience, but through a psychological inquiry into its\\n\\n ― 187 ―\\n                            \\nfacts. Whence come the ideal elements which give to°experi-ence\\nexperience its meaning? By what process do we interpret°sensa-tions\\nsensations so that they become significant to us of objects and\\nevents in space and time? These questions are simply the\\nfundamental questions of psychology, and can be answered\\nonly by a complete treatise on psychology. Nothing but very\\ngeneral considerations may be expected of me here. The\\nanswer which is ordinarily given to the question, the one we\\nhave just seen given, is undoubtedly the correct answer.\\nSensations get meaning by being interpreted through their\\nrelations to the rest of experience; through the processes of\\nidentification and discrimination. But the sensation is not\\nidentified with nor discriminated from another sensation.\\nThis would add no whit to its significance, besides being a\\nprocess psychologically impossible. Previous sensations, as\\nexistences, are gone for ever; gone as much as the time in\\nwhich they occurred. It is true, doubtless, that they have left\\norganic traces of their occurrence in the brain; it may be\\ntrue that these organic traces may, by indirect stimulation,\\nre-awaken sensations like to the previous ones. But in this\\nprocess there is, as such, no aid. There is so much sensuous\\nmaterial indirectly stimulated added to the sensuous°mate-rial\\nmaterial directly stimulated, and that is all. If sensations before\\nwere multiple, chaotic, needing interpretation, there has\\nbeen added more multiple chaotic material, equally in need\\nof interpretation. Multiplication of sensations is not°interpre-tation\\ninterpretation of sensations previously existent.\\nThe identification is of the meaning of the present\\nsensation with some meaning previously experienced, but\\nwhich, although previously experienced, still exists because\\nit is meaning, and not occurrence. This identification gives\\nthe present sensation all the meaning possessed by those\\nexperiences with which it is identified. It renders it symbolic\\nof whatever these other experiences signified. If I attribute\\nany meaning to the idea gold, all that meaning is transferred\\ninto the present sensation as soon as this sensation is seen to\\nhave the same symbolism. And it is seen to have the same\\nsymbolism just because the mind brings this meaning to\\nbear upon the given sensation. There is undoubtedly a°mech-anism\\nmechanism, conveniently termed the association of ideas, which\\n\\n ― 188 ―\\n                            \\ninsures that the mind brings a certain set, as it were, of its\\ninterpreting activities to bear rather than another, but the\\nfinal result of meaning is wholly dependent upon the group\\nof ideal significances which is brought to bear. The°inter-preting\\ninterpreting activity may bring itself to bear in such a way that it\\nshall regard the sensations as iron pyrites or as the talisman\\nof life; but upon this way depends the meaning of the\\nexperience. In short, the sole way of accounting for the fact\\nthat we have significant experience, or that sensations, in\\naddition to being psychical occurrences, are also psychical\\nmeanings, is that the mind conserves permanently out of\\nevery experience the meaning of that experience, and, when\\nit sees fit, reads this conserved meaning into a given°sensa-tion\\nsensation, thereby completing the transfer of significance. The\\nexperience, as an existence at a given time, has for ever\\nvanished. Its meaning, as an ideal quality, remains as long\\nas the mind does. Indeed, its remaining is the remaining of\\nthe mind; the conservation of the ideal quality of experience\\nis what makes the mind a permanence.\\nIf it be asked, then, how psychical experience can\\nbegin, the answer is, indifferently, either that it does not\\nbegin, or that it begins as the beginning of the development\\n—the manifestation—of internal content of intelligence. It\\ndoes not begin in the sense that meaning arises out of that\\nwhich has no meaning. It does not begin in the sense that\\nsensations as mere occurrences ever group themselves so\\nthat they have in addition meaning. For meaning is mediate,\\nbeing through relation; it is ideal, being what is symbolized\\nto intelligence. If intelligence were not present with a°mini-mum\\nminimum of intelligent or ideal quality to read into sensations,\\nthese sensations would never get significance, or presence in\\nconscious experience. The mind must possess at the very\\noutset the idea that there is meaning there. It must project\\ninto sensations the conception that they are significant, even\\nif it does not develop the measure of this significance. A\\nmind which does not come to sensations with an ineradicable\\npre-judgment that the sensations are interpretable, that is,\\npossible bearers of an ideal quality, does not have the°start-ing\\nstarting-point for any interpretation, and its sensation could not\\never get a beginning on the road of meaning. The sensations\\n\\n ― 189 ―\\n                            \\nmight conceivably revive each other and fuse with each\\nother indefinitely, but meaning is absent until they°symbol-ize\\nsymbolize each other; and they fail to symbolize each other until the\\nmeaning of one is represented by another. But, after all, the\\nconception of the recalling and fusing of sensations is not\\none to be allowed, except upon the supposition of the°inter-preting\\ninterpreting activity of intelligence. The very fact that sensations\\nare so connected that the peripheral stimulation of one kind\\nwill set up the central stimulation of another is due to the\\nunification of meaning which has some time made them\\nfractional members of one whole, so that one cannot recur,\\neven as existence, without the other. Attention has at some\\ntime laid its delaying hand upon them and conjoined them; it\\nhas selected them for and excluded others from its°connect-ing\\nconnecting grasp; and this is to say that they have been given a\\nunity in that which they symbolize. Sensations cannot revive\\neach other except as members of one whole of meaning; and\\neven if they could, we should have no beginning of°signifi-cant\\nsignificant experience. Significance, meaning, must be already\\nthere. Intelligence, in short, is the one indispensable°condi-tion\\ncondition of intelligent experience.\\nThis seen and stated, it becomes a question of simple\\nfact how far developed in any case the necessary intelligence\\nmay be. For our general considerations, it is enough that the\\nminimum requirement of an intelligence which recognizes\\nthat its sensations have meaning be met; whether any°defi-nite\\ndefinite meanings, and, if so, what, are projected into°sensa-tions\\nsensations, is at present a matter of indifference. We do not care\\nwhether they are interpreted as in space and time; as°pos-sessing\\npossessing necessarily quantity, quality, relation and modality\\nor not. It is enough to know that they become experience\\nonly as interpreting intelligence projects into them°some-thing\\nsomething of its own being; they are what they are through this\\nrelation to intelligence. There is therefore no beginning of\\nintelligent experience, except such as involves intelligence.\\nThis leads us to recognize that intelligence has a°neces-sary\\nnecessary internal permanent content; and that it is only because\\nit has, and because it supplies it to its sense-stimuli, that\\nthere ever arises significant experience, and that this occurs\\njust in the degree in which intelligence possesses a synthetic\\n\\n ― 190 ―\\n                            \\ncontent which it can project into its stimuli. In other words,\\nwhether we inquire after the origin or growth of mental\\nexperience we find involved a synthetic intelligence, that is\\nto say, an intelligence which possesses a content as opposed\\nto one which is purely formal. Recent Empirical Psychology\\nshows that it has run the circuit and returned to the position\\nof Locke. Locke fitted the mind out with sensations on the\\none side, and associating comparing activities on the other.\\nThese latter were purely formal. They merely operated from\\nwithout upon the material of sense, dividing and combining.\\nThen Psychology attempted to get along with the sensations\\nonly. But it was driven to re-introduce the associating°activ-ity\\nactivity, and now we see it driven to bring back the comparing\\nrelating activity. We have complaints that the Empirical\\nSchool has neglected the native ^relating capacity of the\\nmind, and that we must recognize that it is endowed with\\nthe ability to identify and discriminate. But this relating\\ncapacity is still conceived as formal, although the conception\\ninvolves a contradiction. The relations are conceived as°su-perinduced\\nsuperinduced, as it were, upon the material of sensation,°intro-ducing\\nintroducing ab extra order into them; instead of as necessary to\\nconstitute their entire being as members of conscious°experi-ence\\nexperience. When Psychology recognizes that the relating activity\\nof mind is one not exercised upon sensations, but one which\\nsupplies relations and thereby makes meaning (makes°expe-rience\\nexperience, as Kant said), Psychology will be in a position to\\nexplain, and thus to become Philosophy.\\nThe mention of Kant\\'s name suggests that both his\\nstrength and his weakness lie in the line just mentioned. It is\\nhis strength that he recognizes that an apperceptive unity\\ninterpreting sensations through categories which constitute\\nthe synthetic content of self-consciousness is indispensable to\\nexperience. It is his weakness that he conceives this content\\nas purely logical and hence as formal. Self-consciousness has\\na material, a psychological content. Kant was never able to\\nbridge the dualism between his a priori form and his a\\nposteriori content, because he conceived of sensations as\\nfurnishing meaning provided only they were unified by the\\nforms of intuition and the categories of understanding. In\\ntruth, the sensations supply no meaning. It is the sensations,\\n\\n ― 191 ―\\n                            \\nhowever, with the ideal content given them by the self,\\nwhich are meaning. The self does not work with a priori\\nforms upon an a posteriori material, but intelligence as ideal\\n(or a priori) constitutes experience (or the a posteriori) as\\nhaving meaning.\\nBut I must return from this digression. Experience\\nbegins when intelligence projects something of itself into\\nsensations. We have now to recognize that experience\\ngrows, or gets more meaning, just in the degree in which\\nintelligence reads more ideal content into it. The adult has\\nmore experience than the child-the Englishman than the\\nBushman—because he has more ideas in his intellect to\\nbring to bear upon his sensations and thus make them°sig-nificant\\nsignificant. Were the theory of our recent writers of the°Empir-ical\\nEmpirical School correct, the difference must be (1) that the\\nEnglish adult has his formal capacity of relating more\\nsharpened, and (2) that he has a greater number of revived\\nsensations which he combines with his present. But it ought\\nto be evident by this time that (to take the latter point first)\\nthe addition of revived sensations would in itself make the\\nexperience more confused, make it less significant. It is the\\naddition of sensations selected because they possess the same\\nmeaning, it is their unification with the present as same\\ncontent to intelligence, it is their discrimination as°suggest-ing\\nsuggesting here and there a new and different shade of meaning,—it\\nis, in short, the supplying of meaning through sensations,\\nand not of sensations, that makes the experience more°signif-icant\\nsignificant. And this is to say that experience grows as°intelli-gence\\nintelligence adds out of its own ideal content ideal quality. So we\\nmay see (to take up the other point) that any amount of\\nsharpening of the mere power of identification and°discrimi-nation\\ndiscrimination, of comparison as a formal power, would add no whit\\nto the experience. The experience as an existence, as a\\nclustering of sensations, is already there. The sole thing is to\\nfind out what it means, and this can be done only as there is\\nsupplied the mediate relational ideal factor. The growth of\\nthe power of comparison implies not a formal growth, but a\\nsynthetic internal growth. It implies that when the mind is\\nstimulated to an act of comparison, it has a more varied,\\ncomplex, better organized system of ideas or meanings to\\n\\n ― 192 ―\\n                            \\nbring to bear upon its sensations, and thus to transfer to\\nthese its own content of significance.\\nThis transference evidently incorporates the given°ex-perience\\nexperience into the system of meanings or of intelligence, and\\nthereby the better prepares the latter for future apperceptive\\nacts; its incorporation adds to the synthetic content of°intel-ligence\\nintelligence, and thereby to the meaning of possible future°expe-riences\\nexperiences. The process of the growth of experience is°accord-ingly\\naccordingly a reciprocal one. Any experience has meaning as the\\nself projects this meaning into it from its own ideal store;\\nthis projection appropriates the given experience, as to its\\nmeaning, into the ideal store of the self, thereby farther\\ndeveloping it. Knowledge might be indifferently described,\\ntherefore, as a process of idealization of experience, or of\\nrealization of intelligence. It is each through the other.°Ulti-mately\\nUltimately the growth of experience must consist in the°develop-ment\\ndevelopment out of itself by intelligence of its own implicit ideal\\ncontent upon occasion of the solicitation of sensation. But\\nthis is again a thought to be elaborated at another time.\\nWe may sum up our results as follows: meaning°con-stitutes\\nconstitutes the worth of every psychical experience; meaning is\\nnot bare existence, but is an inferential mediate factor; it is\\nrelation and is ideal; as ideal it is supplied by intelligence out\\nof its own content; this content constitutes, indeed, the°real-ity\\nreality of intelligence. I think we may have reason now to\\ncongratulate ourselves that we did not, at the beginning,\\nmake any inquiry into the connection between this ideal\\nquality or the meaning of experience and objective reality.\\nFor, it seems to me, that would have been to begin at the\\nwrong end, and imply that there was somehow, somewhere\\npresent to consciousness, a conception of what reality is by\\nwhich we could measure the significance of our experience.\\nAnd I have become convinced by the inquiry set forth in the\\npreceding pages that if reality is itself an element in°con-scious\\nconscious experience, it must as such come under the scope of\\nthe significance, the meaning of experience, and hence°can-not\\ncannot be used as an external standard to measure this°mean-ing\\nmeaning. The reality of experience is, in short, an element of its\\ninterpretation, of its ideal quality or relation to intelligence.\\nWe do not have externally given to us some fixed conception\\n\\n ― 193 ―\\n                            \\nof reality which we can compare with our ideas, and thereby\\nsee how much agreement with reality the latter have.°Real-ity\\nReality, like everything else that has meaning, is a function of\\nour ideas. To find out what it is we must look within these\\nideas. It is the great merit of English psychology that in\\nattempt, at least, it has recognized this. It is its defect that it\\nhas tried to find this reality in the ideas, as existences, where\\nnaught can be found. We have now to see whether better\\nfortune may meet an attempt to discover the nature of°real-ity\\nreality, where all is ultimately contained and must be found in\\nthe ideas as significances, as meanings. I hope, accordingly,\\nat some future time, to ask after this relation of idea to\\nreality.\\n\\n ― 194 ―\\n                            \\nProfessor Ladd\\'s Elements of Physiological Psychology [First published in New Englander and Yale Review, XLVI (June\\n1887), 528-37. Not previously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nElements of Physiological Psychology. A Treatise of theActivities and Nature of the Mind, from a Physical and\\nExperimental Point of View. By George T. Ladd,°Pro-fessor\\nProfessor of Philosophy in Yale University. New York:\\nCharles Scribner\\'s Sons, 1887. 8vo., pp. 696.\\n\\nIt is safe to say that the publication of Professor Ladd\\'s\\nElements of Physiological Psychology marks an important\\nepoch in the study of psychology in this country, and even of\\nphilosophy. It would mark a fact of much significance were\\nit only that it presents such a striking contrast to what is\\npopularly understood in English-speaking countries as°phys-iological\\nphysiological psychology. Rash speculation, immature and\\ncrude generalization, unfounded assertion of individual\\nopinion as scientific fact, a maximum of fancy with a°modi-cum\\nmodicum of fact, this has been too often presented as°physiologi-cal\\nphysiological psychology. If we add that materialism of an unreasoned\\nand primitive type has frequently gone along with this°mix-ture\\nmixture, we shall not wonder that some psychologists have been\\nled to attack all psychology of a \"physiological\" character in\\nthe name of that which they call \"pure.\" But such works\\nhave had no countenance nor support from the real°investi-gators\\ninvestigators in this new science. Their work has been patient,\\nthorough, and detailed, for the most part on definite and\\nlimited topics. Scattered through various journals and°mono-graphs\\nmonographs, and making no pretensions to present wide°generali-zations\\ngeneralizations, its value has been overlooked even by special°culti-vators\\ncultivators of general psychology; how much more by the public\\n\\n ― 195 ―\\n                            \\nto whom popular writings appeal. In Germany, matters\\nhave been somewhat better, not only because there are many\\nmore special investigators, but because many of the higher\\nphysiologies, and Wundt\\'s masterly work in particular,\\nhave familiarized the philosophic audience with its broader\\nfeatures. Professor Ladd\\'s work ought to do this for the\\nEnglish-speaking public. Few men have either the occasion,\\nthe patience or the desire to wade through the immense\\namount of detailed specific articles, and reports which form\\nthe real physiological psychology. But no man interested in\\nsuch subjects at all has any excuse, henceforth, for°remain-ing\\nremaining ignorant of its wider aspects or even of many of its\\nspecial facts. Dr. Ladd has done this wading, this°compil-ing\\ncompiling, this condensing, this arranging for him, and has done it\\nwith a carefulness, a width of research, a thoroughness and\\na patience which leave little to be desired.\\nBut this, after all, is only the negative side of the\\nmatter. Its important and positive significance is that it\\nmarks the beginning of new methods of psychological study\\nin this country. It is natural, perhaps inevitable, that°enthu-siastic\\nenthusiastic devotees of the new discipline should greatly overrate\\nthe importance of these new methods, and even take°excep-tions\\nexceptions to such apparently axiomatic statements as that°phys-iological\\nphysiological knowledge in and of itself is of no psychological\\navail; but this one-sided and somewhat unintelligent°overrat-ing\\noverrating should not lead others to a neglect equally blind. Indeed,\\none of the traits of Dr. Ladd\\'s book is the skill and wisdom\\nwith which he holds the scales on this point. His generous\\nbut cautious position on the value and limits of the new\\nscience will command, I am sure, the adherence of the most\\nof his readers. But in lingering upon these general remarks\\nwe have kept ourselves too long from an account of the\\ncontents of Ladd\\'s work, which, though termed°\"Ele-ments\\n\"Elements,\" is of 700 pages.\\nAfter a brief introduction upon the science itself (to\\nwhich we shall return later), Dr. Ladd gives the first part of\\nhis work to a description of the structure and functions of\\nthe nervous system, without any reference to the phenomena\\nof consciousness as determined by introspection; the second\\npart describes the various correlations between these nerve\\n\\n ― 196 ―\\n                            \\nphenomena and those of consciousness, with an account of\\ntheir laws, while the third part presents \"such conclusions\\nas may be legitimately gathered or more speculatively°in-ferred\\ninferred concerning the nature (considered as a real being) of\\nthe human mind.\" The second part, which treats of°physio-logical\\nphysiological psychology, in its limited sense, is further divided by\\ntopics. It includes a pretty complete discussion of cerebral\\nlocalization; of psycho-physics, as an account of the quality,\\nquantity, combination and temporal order of physical°stim-uli\\nstimuli with their psychical responses; a very interesting chapter\\non \"certain statical relations of the body and mind,\" an\\naccount of the relation between mind and sex, age, race,\\ntemperament, etc.; and a chapter on the physical basis of the\\nhigher faculties—memory, attention, etc. The first or strictly\\nphysiological part occupies just about one-third of the book,\\nand gives a compact, accurate and for the most part clear\\naccount of the anatomy, histology, and physiology of the\\nnervous system. This portion of the book gives an account of\\nthe spinal cord, of the brain and its component parts, based\\nupon the researches of the best of modern investigators with\\nalmost a hundred illustrative plates (whose almost uniform\\ntechnical excellence is worthy of high praise); an account of\\nthe investigations of Du Bois Reymond, Hermann and\\nothers on the electrical properties of the nerves; a summary\\nof the views of Meynert, Flechsig and others upon the\\nnerves as conductors; an account of the sensory organs, and\\nof the embryological development of the nervous system. In\\nshort, we find that Dr. Ladd has possessed himself of pretty\\nmuch all that the best neurologists have had to say in their\\nchosen fields, and that he has summarized it excellently for\\nthe general reader.\\nIt is, however, to the second and third parts that the\\none interested especially in psychology will turn with the\\nmore eagerness, and also, I may add, with the more°satisfac-tion\\nsatisfaction. Dr. Ladd gives sixty pages to the vexed question of\\ncerebral localization. In this discussion, he states lucidly and\\naccurately the theories of Hitzig and Ferrier; of Munk and\\nExner, of Goltz and Wundt, as well as the researches of\\nmany less known investigators. We are also given quite a\\ndetailed account of the principal evidences bearing upon the\\n\\n ― 197 ―\\n                            \\nmatter, which are rightly classified under the three heads of\\nexperimental, of pathological and histological (and°anatomi-cal\\nanatomical). Finally, the general trend of the whole matter is\\nsummed up in a few judicial generalizations. We speak of\\nthis matter in particular not only because it is one of very\\nconsiderable importance, but also because it illustrates Dr.\\nLadd\\'s usual method of procedure in vexed questions—and\\nwhat questions in this subject are not vexed? We are always\\npresented fairly with the various theories upon the subject;\\nwith as full an outline as possible of the special scientific\\nevidence, and finally with a few careful and impartial°con-clusions\\nconclusions. Not every one, of course, will agree with these\\nsummaries; not every one will think that just the right\\nmeasure of credence has been given to this or that authority;\\nbut no one, I believe, will deny the spirit of thoroughness,\\ncaution and justice in which the work is done. In this°partic-ular\\nparticular point, Dr. Ladd\\'s conclusions seem to me to be in\\naccordance with the tendency of the best authorities at°pres-ent\\npresent—namely, in the recognition of the general principle of\\nlocalization, but with a denial of definite and separated\\n\"centres,\" and with less emphasis than formerly upon the\\nimportance of the cells as compared with the fibres. In his\\nown words \"everything in both anatomy and physiology\\nindicates that the principle of localized function applies, in\\nsome sort, to the cerebral hemispheres. So-called \\'centres,\\'\\n\\'areas,\\' are however in no case to be regarded as portions of\\nits nervous substance that can be marked off by fixed lines\\nfor the confinement of definite functions within rigid limits.\"\\nDr. Ladd\\'s treatment of sensation is, so far as the\\nsubject of quality is concerned, as full as the limits of space\\nwould allow. Following Helmholtz in general both as to\\nhearing and sight, he has by no means neglected other\\nauthorities. The discussion of \"muscular\" sensation is\\nhardly as complete as the present importance of the subject\\nwould warrant. Our author is justified in rejecting the°the-ory\\ntheory as to its central origin, but he does not seem to me\\nadequately to have weighed the evidence for resolving it into\\nsensations of contact, of the mutual push and pull of the\\nskin, joints, tendons, etc. The weakest point in the°discus-sion\\ndiscussion of sensations is, however, the chapter upon quantity.\\n\\n ― 198 ―\\n                            \\nWe are given, indeed, much the fullest statement that exists\\nin English of the methods employed, and of the particular\\nfacts ascertained by Weber, Fechner and others. But these\\nfacts have been employed by the latter as the basis of a\\n\"science\" of psycho-physics, and the importance of this\\nmatter would justify an extended reference to matters which\\nare not alluded to. How far can the category of extensive\\nquantity be applied to psychical states at all? Do we really\\nmeasure the relation between stimulus and sensation, or\\nsimply our own judgments? Can \"the least distinguishable\\nsensation\" be regarded in any sense as a fixed quantity, so as\\nto serve as a unit? Can Fechner\\'s formula be interpreted so\\nas to give a very different result from that which he gets?\\nDiscussion in Germany at the present time is turning very\\nlargely upon such points as these. Accepting the facts,°at-tempts\\nattempts are now being made to get at their highest°signifi-cance\\nsignificance, and an account of these discussions with a judicial\\nsummary would have added to the interest of Dr. Ladd\\'s\\nchapter. However, in a field of such vastness and°complex-ity\\ncomplexity, it is not surprising to find some important matters only\\nlightly touched upon.\\nFrom these topics, we are brought to that of sense-\\npresentation, as distinct from mere sensations; in especial to\\nthat of the projection and localization of sensations in space.\\nThis seems to me to be, upon the whole, the very best of Dr.\\nLadd\\'s work. It is equally excellent in the thoroughness and\\nability with which the specific evidence is treated, and in the\\nability and wisdom of its conclusions. Inverting Dr. Ladd\\'s\\norder, we will state the latter first: \"The object of sense-\\nperception, the presentation of sense, is not an extra-mental\\nentity, made up outside the mind, and borne into or°im-pressed\\nimpressed upon it through the avenues of sense. It is a mental\\nconstruction. The field of vision is a subjective affair, and so\\nis the field of touch. The same psychical subject which\\nreacts upon the stimulation of the nervous organs of sense,\\nin the form of sensations, by its activity in synthesizing these\\nsensations, constructs the objects of sense. The fundamental\\nfact is the presence and activity of the subject known as\\nMind.\" Or, as he states the matter at another time, \"only\\nmental factors can be built into mental products,\" and this\\n\\n ― 199 ―\\n                            \\nmust be by means of a mental constructive synthesis. The\\nsensation is itself a mental state; the process by which the\\nsensation is projected and localized is itself a mental process,\\nnay, \"a mental achievement.\" These statements put the\\nexplanation of space-perception upon its only possible°signif-icant\\nsignificant basis, and it is to be counted a great gain that no \"wolf\\ncry\" of \"idealism\" has kept Dr. Ladd from them.\\nI should be giving a very wrong impression, however,\\nif I let it be supposed that the chief emphasis is put upon\\nthese conclusions. The emphasis rests upon the painstaking,\\nminute and thorough analysis of the process. Dr. Ladd\\nstates that the explanation of space-perception involves the\\nrecognition of the following particular truths: (1) There\\nmust be a combination of two or more qualitatively different\\nseries of sensations. Thus pure differences in pitch alone, or\\npressure or color do not give material for constructing°spe-cial\\nspecial objects. (2) There must be a certain adaptability in the\\nsensations to form graded series and to combine with other\\nseries—a condition which is found for the most part only in\\ntouch and vision. (3) Every sensation, besides its general\\nqualitative character, must have its own \"local stamp,\"°cor-responding\\ncorresponding in some way to the part of the organism affected.\\n(4) There are various stages in the elaboration of°sensa-tions\\nsensations into extended objects. Of these, localization and°eccen-tric\\neccentric projection are the more important. (5) There is°con-stantly\\nconstantly required not only the activity of mind in responding\\nto stimuli with sensations, but in combining them in a°syn-thetic\\nsynthetic and constructive way.\\nDr. Ladd\\'s discussion consists in the extended and\\ncomprehensive treatment of each of the above five points.\\nOur limits of space forbid touching upon more than one, the\\nthird. Dr. Ladd adopts completely the theory of Lotze as to\\nthe existence of local signs, though not so completely his\\ntheory as to their nature. Dr. Ladd would hold that it\\nconsists in a certain shading of the sensation, and that every\\n\"spatial\" sense has a local system of its own. He thus\\nopposes the extreme theory of the English school, which\\nmakes spatial perception to rest upon \"muscular\" sensation.\\nIn this he is at one with Ward in England, and James in this\\ncountry. Whether he would also admit \"extensity\" or not as\\n\\n ― 200 ―\\n                            \\na specific element in the sensation does not°appear—appar-ently\\nappear—apparently, however, he would refer \"extensity\" rather to the\\nsynthetic reaction of the mind than to the sensuous element\\nitself. It would certainly simplify matters, however, if the\\nlocal sign could itself be made out to be an \"extensive\"\\nfactor, and not merely qualitative in the general sense. From\\nthese general principles, Dr. Ladd goes on to apply them to\\nthe special subjects of touch and visual space-perception.\\nFor this we must refer to the book itself, as, indeed, we must\\nfor all the other topics treated, except to mention that the\\nlast four chapters discuss the results of the previous portions\\nof the book in the light of fundamental metaphysical°princi-ples\\nprinciples. These chapters will be to many readers the most°inter-esting\\ninteresting part of the book, for no one but a narrow specialist\\nwill deny that the chief value of the specific psycho-physical\\ninvestigations lies in the aid which they afford in building up\\na \"spiritual picture\" of ourselves and of our relation to the\\nuniverse. A discussion of these results lies far outside the\\ncapacity of this article, and it is enough to say that in a\\ngeneral way the conclusions reached tend to agree with\\nthose of Lotze.\\nI have already suggested that I should have a word or\\ntwo to say upon the view of physiological psychology taken\\nin this book. The criticism which I personally should have to\\nmake upon it is that it is not one view, but a wavering\\nbetween two. The older opinion regarding physiological°psy-chology\\npsychology is that it is the science of the relations of mind and\\nbody; of the correlations of the physical and the psychical.\\nThe cause is evident enough. Psychology began with a\\npurely \"introspective\" study of consciousness, and after it\\nhad attained some completeness on this line, it was found\\nthat nerve processes are at the basis of many, if not all, of\\nthese conscious states. So there grew up the idea of a third\\nscience, distinct in some sort from both physiology and\\npsychology, which should deal with the correlations of the\\ntwo. It was not to deal in any way with the psychical in itself\\n(that was fully ascertained by introspection) but with its\\nparallelism with the physical. But it was found that this\\nphysiological application did not leave the strictly°psycho-logical\\npsychological facts unaltered; it led to pretty complete°transforma-tions\\n ― 201 ―\\n                            \\ntransformations of them, especially in the theory of sensation where the\\nchange was a revolution. Thus there has gradually arisen,\\nespecially under the influence of Wundt, the conception of\\nphysiological psychology as a method, whose end is not the\\nparallelisms between the brain and consciousness, but the\\ninvestigation of consciousness itself by physical methods.\\nDr. Ladd can hardly be said to have adopted either of these\\nviews, or even to have discriminated them. On the one hand,\\nhe says: \"Two sets of phenomena must be examined in their\\nrelations to each other, and the laws of these relations\\npointed out,\" (page 6). Again, (page 7): \"The constant\\nforms of correlation constitute the laws for the discovery of\\nwhich physiological psychology undertakes its special°re-searches\\nresearches,\" and (page 13), \"that the structures and°func-tions\\nfunctions of the body, especially of the nervous mechanism, and\\nthe activities of the mind are extensively and intimately\\ncorrelated, is a fact beyond all doubt. It is the particular task\\nof physiological psychology to show in what manner and to\\nwhat extent such correlation exists.\" On the other hand, he\\nsays: \"It is to be regarded simply as psychology approached\\nand studied from a certain side or point of view,\" (page 1;\\nsimilarly defined, page 4). \"The peculiarity of physiological\\npsychology, considered as a branch of the general science of\\nmind consists largely in the method of its approach,\" (page\\n9). \"The enlargement of our knowledge of psychology is the\\nend to be reached; physiology is to give us the way by which\\nand the guidance under which the approach to this end must\\nbe made,\" (page 11).\\nIt is thus difficult to avoid the conclusion that Dr. Ladd\\nhas confused two opposed—almost contradictory, opinions.\\nOn the one hand, physiological psychology is nothing but\\npsychology approached by a certain method; on the other,\\npsychology is to be completed by one method, that of°intro-spection\\nintrospection, and then there is to be a science of the relations\\nthus discovered, to those discovered by the science of°phys-iology\\nphysiology. That the two views involve radically distinct ideas\\nconcerning the mind and its relations to the body need not be\\npointed out. They also lead up to radically distinct°philo-sophical\\nphilosophical conceptions. The inevitable outcome of the°\"corre-lation\\n\"correlation\" theory is a continuation, under modified form, of the\\n\\n ― 202 ―\\n                            \\nCartesian Dualism. The other would seem to lead up to a\\nMonism or a theory which should regard mind and body as\\nnot merely correlate, but as members of one \"real being.\"\\nThis, of course, would affect only the third part of Dr.\\nLadd\\'s work which has been omitted from this review. But\\nthe confusion has its effect upon the specific treatment of\\ntopics like that of cerebral localization. The spinal cord and\\nlower centres of the brain are treated in part first, as having\\nno immediate psychical bearing, while the parts above the\\nbasal ganglia are treated in part second as being in°immedi-ate\\nimmediate relation to conscious facts. In other words some nervous\\nphenomena are treated as psycho-physical, others as purely\\nphysiological, although it is also clearly stated that the°en-tire\\nentire nervous system forms a unity, and is as a whole a\\ndifferentiation of one of the layers of the body. Dr. Ladd is\\nalso led into evident embarrassment at just this point upon\\nthe relations of animal and human intelligence, and, indeed,\\nupon the various forms of animal intelligence. On page 249\\nit is stated that the spinal cord of a frog, with the lower\\ncentres of the brain give signs of psychical phenomena; on\\npage 251, he says that the nervous mechanism, working\\nwithout any accompaniment of mental phenomena, may°ac-count\\naccount for the most of what is done by the hen or pigeon\\ndeprived of its cerebral hemispheres. Either different°princi-ples\\nprinciples are applied to cold and warm blooded animals, or such\\nstatements contradict each other. This is not the place to\\nenter into the discussion of the matter, but in view of the\\nfact that the nervous system is a unit and that the°applica-tion\\napplication of physiology has given us new and changed ideas in\\npsychology, and not merely an account of the physical basis\\nof already ascertained psychical facts, would it not be well\\ndefinitely to adopt the view that physiological psychology is\\na branch of general psychology characterized solely by its\\nexperimental method of approach?\\nThe other criticism which I should be inclined to make\\nupon the general character of Dr. Ladd\\'s book is that it\\ngreatly under-estimates the importance of the doctrine of\\napperception. Wundt\\'s work is, indeed, remarkably varied\\nand touches almost every side of psychology, but it is to be\\nregretted that his chief theory, that of central innervation\\n\\n ― 203 ―\\n                            \\n(stated in physiological terms), or of apperception, in°psy-chological\\npsychological language, should be so largely overlooked in a\\nbook of the importance of the one under review. Dr. Ladd\\nlimits apperception to clear and distinct perception; while in\\nthe German use, introduced by Leibnitz, and continued in\\ndifferent aspects by Kant and Herbart, and made central by\\nWundt, it signifies the inner central reaction upon stimuli\\nwhich reach the brain; or in psychological terms, the°influ-ence\\ninfluence of the organized mind upon the separate sensations\\nwhich reach it. Distinctness of impression is, indeed, one\\nresult of this central activity, but only one, and in many\\nrespects a subordinate one. Dr. Ladd\\'s under-estimate of its\\nimportance is to be regretted not only because it fails to\\nbring before the reader one of the highest and most°compre-hensive\\ncomprehensive generalizations (to my mind, the most so) yet\\nreached in physiological psychology, but also because of its\\ninfluence on the treatment of specific topics. For example,\\nDr. Ladd gives a very interesting chapter on the time-\\nmeasurement of psychical phenomena, which shows deep°re-search\\nresearch, great accuracy and which is brought narrowly to\\ndate. It fails, however, to convey the full importance of the\\nsubject, because it states the facts as a series of isolated\\nmeasurements. Such, indeed, they are to many investigators,\\nbut in the light of Wundt\\'s theory, they are no longer mere\\nstatements that such and such a process occupies so much\\ntime; they are facts illustrating the nature and working of\\nthe central activity of mind. So too Dr. Ladd\\'s treatment of\\nthe physical relations of the will, and of attention, would\\nhave been, in my opinion, greatly enriched by a better°appre-ciation\\nappreciation of Wundt\\'s theory—and all this, whether one accept\\nor deny the theory.\\nTaking the book as a whole, however, one cannot but\\nadmire its patient research, its massive learning, its°thor-oughness\\nthoroughness, and its candor. Dr. Ladd appears to have made\\nhimself acquainted and at first hand, with almost every\\nauthority on the almost infinite number of topics which fall\\nunder his comprehensive scope, even to the most recent. His\\nuse of them is discriminating and able. That there should be\\noccasional inequalities, is inevitable, but it is safe to say that\\nthese will be discovered only by the specialist, and even\\n\\n ― 204 ―\\n                            \\nthen, for the most part, only by the specialist in his one\\nspecial field. The book, to use a term generally better left\\nunused in a review, is indeed a monument; it is not only the\\nonly physiological psychology in the English language, but\\nit is deserving of this distinction.\\n\\n ― 205 ―\\n                            \\nEthics and Physical Science [First published in Andover Review, VII (June 1887), 573-91. Not\\npreviously reprinted.]\\n»*\\nThe ever-old problem of the relations of the Divine and the\\nHuman is still with us, unchanged in its abiding freshness\\nand perennial significance. But discussion with regard to it\\nis continually shifting its point of view and its immediate\\naim. The discussions which filled our periodicals only four\\nor five years ago already seem untimely and aside from the\\npoint. New interests have emerged, new problems have\\nthrust themselves upon us. A new face has been put upon\\nthe matter. The question is one of such infinite variety and\\nmagnitude that we see now one of its facets, now another,\\nand the centre of discussion is ever changing. Certain of its\\nwider features endure for a longer time. The battle of the\\nseventeenth century was waged concerning the relations of\\nspirit and matter; the rallying ground of the eighteenth\\ncentury was the relation of God and Nature; the battle-field\\nof to-day is the human soul. Spiritualism or Materialism,\\nDeism or Theism, an anthropology which sees in man a\\ndivine image and superscription, or one which finds him a\\nproduct of the shaping of earthly clay,—these various°antin-omies\\nantinomies are some of the protean forms which the one°endur-ing\\nenduring question of humanity takes upon itself.\\nThe present way of putting the question, that which\\nmakes it centre in human origin, nature, and development,\\nis the outcome of the growth of physical science in general\\nand of the theory of evolution in particular. Is man the last\\noutcome of a series of physical changes following°mechani-cal\\nmechanical laws, or is he the spiritual end which nature in all her\\nprocesses has been aiming towards? Is man one of the forms\\nwhich the kaleidoscope of animal life has assumed, is he one\\nof the transitory varieties in which the type has embodied\\n\\n ― 206 ―\\n                            \\nitself; or is his origin from God, that in his very life in\\nnature he may yet find a way to make life divine and°God-like\\nGodlike?\\nIt is necessarily involved in this manner of conceiving\\nthe problem that agnosticism is a transitory resting-place, a\\nmere breathing-time for the renewal of the contest.°Agnosti-cism\\nAgnosticism is by nature a compromise. It is a treaty of partition\\nwhich would divide the kingdom of reality into halves, and\\nproclaim one supernatural and unknowable, the other°natu-ral\\nnatural and the realm of knowledge. It is an attempt to induce\\nthe Human and the Divine to dwell side by side of each\\nother, each in possession of his own domain, barred off from\\nthe other. It will forward us somewhat upon our way, which\\ntakes us into a consideration of the relations between ethics\\nand the physical interpretation of reality, if we look a little\\nfurther into this matter. There is something more than a\\nmerely general reason for the insufficiency of the agnostic\\nsolution. It is true, indeed, that God cannot be limited to the\\nsupremacy of one part of the universe; it is true, indeed, that\\na \"fact encompassing, closing in upon, absorbing every\\nother fact conceivable,\" cannot be treated as something°dis-tinct\\ndistinct and isolate from all facts. This, undoubtedly, alone\\nwould have been enough to compel thought finally beyond\\nthe evasion of agnosticism, the division of reality into°natu-ral\\nnatural and supernatural; but there has been a specific cause at\\nwork which has brought about the same result even more\\nspeedily. Where in this partition does man belong? Does he\\ngo into the realm of the physical or that of the spiritual? Or\\nis he too divided, his soul being allotted to the supernatural,\\nwhile his body is apportioned to the natural? The°impossibil-ity\\nimpossibility of any such division was rendered evident by that rapid\\ndevelopment of physical science which resulted in the°asser-tion\\nassertion that man belongs wholly to its sphere. Physics,°chemis-try\\nchemistry, biology, geology, each separately, and all in their°combi-nation\\ncombination, reached a point where they thrust forth their arms to\\nclaim man as a mere fact within the world of nature, the\\nrealm of events in space and time. And with man included\\nwholly in the physical kingdom vanishes wholly the last\\nremnant of excuse for even the shadow of the supernatural,\\nfor even that unknowable corner of the universe which°ag-nosticism\\n ― 207 ―\\n                            \\nagnosticism would still reserve for the sovereignty of the God\\nover all. In short, the history of the last few years has\\nrevealed that physical science, no more than theology, will\\nput up with a partition of territory. If a spiritual philosophy\\nwill not make and justify a claim to the divine and spiritual\\ncharacter of all reality, physical science will erect itself into\\na mechanical philosophy and formulate a counter claim.\\nFrom the religious side and the scientific, then, comes one\\ncry: What of man, of his origin, and his destiny?\\nA still further result of this development is the fact\\nthat scientific men no longer present themselves in a°destruc-tive\\ndestructive attitude, but claim a constructive mission. One whose\\nintellectual connection with the world ceased eight or ten\\nyears ago would be fairly astounded if he could regain\\nentrance into the realm of thought at this point alone. He\\ndeparted seeing scientific men attacking and denying, or\\nexplaining away the reality of religion and all forms of\\nreligion; he would return to find scientific men formulating a\\nreligion based on what they term scientific categories. He\\ndeparted seeing them engaged in fierce polemics upon free-\\nwill, responsibility, personality; he would return to find\\nthem framing ethical systems, having conveniently dropped\\ntheir negations. While his last glimpse of them would have\\nrevealed them pointing the finger of scorn and contempt at\\nmetaphysics, the first sight which would greet his°bewil-dered\\nbewildered eyes would be the vast structures of philosophy which\\nwere in process of erection. In short, he would find that,\\nwith the application of physical science to man and his\\naffairs, the whole attitude of this science had changed from a\\nnegative position to a constructive one. Lewes, who began\\nhis philosophic career by writing a history of philosophy\\nwith the express object of showing the impossibility of°phi-losophy\\nphilosophy, closed it by writing The Foundations of a Creed.\\nAnd this instance is accurately typical of the recent°develop-ment\\ndevelopment of thought.\\nWhat, then, are we to say to these constructive°at-tempts\\nattempts of physical science? Gladly welcoming its°abandon-ment\\nabandonment of destructive negation, and even of the position of\\nindifferent agnosticism, shall we equally welcome the°con-structive\\nconstructive picture of the universe which it is elaborating? In\\n\\n ― 208 ―\\n                            \\nthe vast field opened by such an inquiry, I shall simply select\\nthat corner which has to do with the ethical efforts of our\\nscientific men turned moralists, and shall glean only over a\\nportion of that.\\nIt is the especial contention of men of science who have\\nturned their thoughts to the sphere of moral action that they\\nare putting ethics, for the first time, on a scientific basis, and\\ngiving to it a positive sanction and a positive end. They can\\nnever cease contrasting it with what they term \"theological\\nethics.\" The latter, according to them, has no firm°founda-tion\\nfoundation. It rests upon the arbitrary decrees of the will of God,\\nand this will is an unverifiable assumption, or at best is\\npurely supernatural and hence out of relation to the true\\nends of humanity. The aim which theological ethics propose\\nis of equal flimsiness with the foundation, or, according to\\nsome of the more ardent, is even immoral, consisting in a\\ndevotion to one\\'s personal salvation in a future realm, and is,\\ntherefore, either utterly disparate with man\\'s daily activities\\nhere, or in conflict with them. And the sanction to which\\ntheological ethics appeals is, if we may trust these writers,\\nworthless, even if not morally degrading, being the escape\\nfrom some arbitrary penalty, or the winning of some equally\\narbitrary reward.\\nIn strong contrast to this picture is the glowing°specta-cle\\nspectacle of scientific ethics. Its basis is the ascertained and°dem-onstrated\\ndemonstrated laws of the universe. We are no longer in the\\nrealm of guess-work, of caprice, or of arbitrary decision; but\\nscience has discovered certain truths about all beings, about\\nanimal life more particularly, and about man and his°rela-tions\\nrelations to fellow-man most especially. These truths, capable of\\nthe same certitude and definiteness as the law of gravitation,\\nor of chemical combination, are the future basis of ethics.\\nAnd the end offered is equally sure and precise. Science has\\ndiscovered the law of evolution; this law shows the universe\\nmaking towards a certain end. What higher object, indeed,\\nwhat other object of human action can be conceived than\\nconformity with the law of all existence? Furthermore, there\\nis no longer a sanction needed; it becomes lost in the motive\\nto right action. Teach man the unity of his nature with that\\nof the world, make him realize that he is an outgrowth of its\\ndevelopment, show him, in particular, his oneness with the\\n\\n ― 209 ―\\n                            \\nsocial organism, foster in him the idea and the feeling that\\nhis good is the good of this larger whole and its detriment\\nhis loss,—and all this not as a matter of speculation but of\\nscientific fact,—and what more is demanded? Thus the°sci-entific\\nscientific men insist upon the certainty of their ethics as°con-trasted\\ncontrasted with the insecurity and arbitrariness of°\"theologi-cal\\n\"theological\" morals; they emphasize its reality, as put side by side\\nwith the artificial and factitious atmosphere of unsecularized\\nmorals; they extol its lofty ideals towering over the personal\\nand even selfish character of the ethics of°\"other-worldli-ness\\n\"other-worldliness.\"\\nIn spite of the vigor and ardor with which these ideas\\nare urged, some of us, at least, remain unmoved. We believe\\nthat the cause of theology and morals is one, and that\\nwhatever banishes God from the heart of things, with the\\nsame edict excludes the ideal, the ethical, from the life of\\nman. Whatever exiles theology makes ethics an expatriate.\\nAnd we believe these things not from obstinacy, nor from\\ntraditional prejudice, as it seems to us, nor yet alone from a\\nmere conviction that supernatural restraints and sanctions\\nare needed for the practical moralizing of humanity; but we\\nare convinced that the physical interpretation of the universe\\nis one which necessarily shuts out those ideas and principles\\nwhich are fundamental to ethics; we are sure that an°inter-pretation\\ninterpretation of reality which confines it to the coexistences of\\nspace, the sequences of time, and the reign of mechanical\\nlaw, is fatal at once to the categories of morals and to the\\nattitude of the practical life of morality. What can we say to\\njustify our tenacious belief?\\nIf we are to justify it at all, we shall have to make out\\ntwo things—one negative, the other positive. We shall have\\nto show that ethics, as an account of right conduct, and the\\nmoral life as the practical ordering of conduct in the right,\\nare not compatible with a physical interpretation of reality.\\nWe shall have to show that they are compatible only with a\\nspiritual interpretation, which in its broad and essential\\nfeatures is identical with the theological teaching of°Christi-anity\\nChristianity. Of these two aspects of the question we can at present\\nhope to touch only the negative, reserving the other for some\\nfuture occasion.\\nIn moral action we find at least three traits which are\\n\\n ― 210 ―\\n                            \\nboth incongruous with and contradictory to the principles\\nwhich a purely physical philosophy (that is, a philosophy\\nwhich applies only the categories of physical science) must,\\nat all hazards, insist upon. These are—(1) activity for an\\nend, that which has a purpose or aim, in technical phrase\\nteleological action; (2) activity from choice, from the°deci-sion\\ndecision of personality, volitional action; and (3) activity°to-wards\\ntowards an ideal, that which is not, but which ought to be. Of\\nthese three traits the first and the last run into each other\\nenough so that they may be conveniently treated together.\\nAction which is purposive, and action which is for the°reali-zation\\nrealization of an ideal, are closely allied phases of the same thing.\\nAs respects this one broad fact and the fact of choice,\\nhowever, the position of the physical philosophers is not at\\nall similar. They admit, nay, rather they claim, that ethical\\naction is that which has an end or ideal; their especial theme\\nfor self-felicitation is that they have discovered and°formu-lated\\nformulated it. But, on the other hand, the fact of choice in the\\nsense of implying any decisive power in personality, they\\ndeny. There are advantages, then, in meeting them on the\\nground that is common. Putting aside the possibility and\\nexistence of choice, we may inquire whether physical science\\nas such is adequate to determining the ideal of human°con-duct\\nconduct. If it fails here, upon its own chosen ground, we may be\\nassured that its failure is only the more manifest when we\\ncome to deal with the questions of personality and°obliga-tion\\nobligation.\\nWe will, accordingly, discuss the question of the°ethi-cal\\nethical ideal. The position of the physical philosophers may be\\nstated as follows: Modern science has reached a point where\\nit can include man under the same generalization with other\\nfacts of nature. The law of evolution shows him to be the\\nmost complete product of the same forces and principles that\\nare at work everywhere in the world. Now, this fact has two\\nethical bearings: it shows that man is not generically°differ-ent\\ndifferent from nature, and that consequently ethical science is not\\ndistinct in its methods and conceptions from physical°sci-ence\\nscience; and that, to determine the fundamental law of man\\'s\\nconduct, we have only to ascertain the fundamental law of\\nthe world. In short, ethics is freed from theological or°meta-physical\\n ― 211 ―\\n                            \\nmetaphysical connections. This is one bearing. The other is, that\\nwe have in the law of evolution itself this fundamental law\\nof both the world and man. Evolution shows us the goal\\nwhither the universe is tending, and also shows the means,\\nthe processes, by which it is reaching this goal. Evolution\\nhas now proceeded far enough so that we can see the general\\nlines on which it is working, and behold the general features\\nin which it is portraying its nature. In particular, the°evolu-tion\\nevolution of the social organism sets before us a definite law,\\nwhich enables us to extend vastly and deepen indefinitely the\\nethics of previous empirical schools without abandoning the\\nsure ground of experience. The law of evolution shows that\\nwe must give up the purely individualistic conception of\\nman, and must regard him as one differentiation of a type of\\nlife which, in working itself out, has developed the°individ-ual\\nindividual. By \"type\" is not implied any metaphysical conception,\\nbut simply that generic animal life is fundamental and prior\\nto any of the specific forms which it has assumed. This\\ngeneric animal life, this type, is the social organism.°Individ-ual\\nIndividual man has not an independent law for his own being; but,\\nsince he is a derivative product, an outgrowth of the social\\ntissue, the law of his being is that of society as a connected\\nwhole.\\nThis law of society, the well-being of the community,\\nis, therefore, the ideal for all human conduct. The individual\\nwho acts in conformity with it is moral; the individual whose\\nconduct makes against the furthering of the social organism\\nis immoral. It further results from this that the particular\\nvirtues, like courage, honesty, wisdom, benevolence, etc.,\\nare put upon a strictly scientific standing; their validity is as\\ncertain as that of electricity, or heat, or light. They tend to\\nbring about and develop the well-being of the social°organ-ism\\norganism; they lend a helping hand to the tendency of evolution.\\nThey are thus no longer arbitrary assertions of one supreme\\nwill, nor arbitrary and isolated declarations of a mysterious\\ninternal power called conscience. Indeed, we may go a step\\nfurther, and say that conscience itself gets for the first time a\\nscientific position. The individual, being an outgrowth of the\\nsocial tissue, must have embodied in himself signs of his\\nunity with it. He must bear in himself the witness of his\\n\\n ― 212 ―\\n                            \\norigin in the larger and more generic existence. This sign,\\nthis witness, is conscience. Man instinctively feels that°hon-esty\\nhonesty is right, and feels disapproval at injustice, because there\\nis incorporated within him the feeling that one helps, the\\nother hinders, that whole of which he is a differentiated\\nmember. Conscience is consolidated and social experience of\\nwhat makes for and against social well-being. It is the\\nsolidarity of consciousness.\\nThis picture of \"scientific ethics\" is, of course, an\\noutline sketch, and yet, if it fails anywhere, it is in that it\\nsets forth the advantages in the foreground and in high\\nlights, while the difficulties are relegated to the background\\nand smothered in the local shadows. It might pay us well to\\nexplore these obscure recesses, to insist upon a nearer view\\nof the diminished figures in the background; but, instead,\\nwe shall challenge the right of the whole picture to be\\nconsidered anything more than an illusion. It is painted with\\ncolors which are borrowed from the school of spiritualism,\\nand to which it has no claim; it is filled in with the shadows\\nof figures who live only in the realm of Will and Reason; it\\nreflects a light which has its source in God himself. Take\\naway this light, abolish this realm, dismiss this school, and\\nthe picture fades out into a mere meaningless blank. Such is\\nour contention. Or, dropping the figure and expressing the\\nmatter positively: if we grant the postulates of the ideal\\nconception of the world, if we assume the primacy of reason,\\nif we acknowledge the supremacy of will,—then we may see\\na certain truth in this scientific ethics, we may see how it\\naids here and there our account of the moral life, how it\\nsupplies, here and there, needed fulcra for the moralization\\nof man. But, denying these conceptions, as in consistency\\nwith a mechanical theory we must do, the whole scheme\\nempties itself of value. In a single sentence the problem\\nreduces itself to this: Can the ethical be regarded as one\\nwith the natural? It may be the natural transformed and\\nhighly developed; but if it is only natural and physical we\\ndeny the possibility of the emergence of the moral from it.\\nGranted the germ of morals working from the first, granted\\nthat this whole structure of the physical is only the garment\\nwith which the ethical has clothed itself, then we can see\\n\\n ― 213 ―\\n                            \\nhow the germ shall finally flower in the splendor of the\\nmoral life, how the garment shall finally manifest the living\\nform within; but not otherwise. In a word, we utterly deny\\nthat the physical world, as physical, has any end; that°na-ture\\nnature, as natural, can give birth to an ideal. How shall we\\nmake good this sweeping denial? By calling attention to\\nthree facts out of a multitude. First, this ideal is°incompati-ble\\nincompatible with the processes by which it is (theoretically) evolved.\\nIt is contradictory to that out of which it is supposed to be\\ndeveloped. The process is one of conflict; its very condition\\nis opposition, competition, selection, survival. The ideal is\\nharmony, unity of purpose and life, community of well-\\nbeing,—a good which does not admit of being competed for,\\nbut in which all must share. And, again, admitting the\\nphysical universe to have evolved a certain goal or end, this\\nis not ethical, for it is in no necessary relation to man; or,\\nspeaking more strictly, it is not man\\'s end: it is something\\nto which he is related as an instrument, a means. While the\\nethical ideal must be one of personality, the ideal which\\nphysical science presents is one which subordinates persons\\nto the relations of things. And, thirdly, we have been°admit-ting\\nadmitting altogether too much: not only is the ideal one which\\nconflicts with the processes by which it is evolved; not only\\nis it an objective ideal,—being in wholly external relation to\\nman,—but there is and can be no such thing as a physical\\nideal. Nature has no end, no aim, no purpose. There is\\nchange only, not advance towards a goal.\\nWe will take up these points one by one. First, as to\\nthe conflict between the ideal and the processes from which\\nit is thought to be developed. However much ethical schools\\ndiffer theoretically, they are all practically agreed upon one\\npoint: the universality of the moral end, in the sense that it\\nis applicable to all who come under it. The intuitionalist,\\nlike Lotze, who makes benevolence in itself the final end; the\\nutilitarian, whose formulæ are the \"greatest happiness of\\nthe greatest number,\" and that in its enumeration \"each\\nshall count as one and only one\"; the Aristotelian and post-\\nKantian, who assert as the end self-realization,°understand-ing\\nunderstanding by \"self\" not something particular, but a universal,\\nmanifested in every man; the evolutionist, who finds the goal\\n\\n ― 214 ―\\n                            \\nto be altruism,—all these, I say, are agreed that all persons\\nhave necessarily an equal claim upon the good. The thought\\nof each finds its practical expression in the dictate that we\\nare to strive for a community of the good, for a state of\\nsociety in which each has an equal share in the ethical,\\nhowever it may be in the other goods of life. The problem is\\nto reconcile this unity, this harmony, with the forces which,\\naccording to scientific men, are at work in bringing about\\nthat series of changes which we call evolution. These are\\nfamiliarly known as the \"struggle for existence\" and°\"sur-vival\\n\"survival of the fittest\"; or, rather, these are the results of the\\nforces. The process of evolution is going on because various\\nforms of life are competing for the quantum of food, etc.,\\nwhich is offered, and because in this competition those\\nwhich gain any advantage which will give them a greater\\nhold upon this supply, whether by organs better fitted for\\nsecuring it, or by those which give them advantages in\\nreproduction, are preserved while others are crowded out.\\nThose better fitted to the environment survive; those less\\nfitted go to the wall. Rivalry, struggle, is thus the very heart\\nof the physical process. In short, the ethical law is not only\\nunlike the natural law, but it is contradictory to it. It sets up\\nas its ideal certain conditions utterly opposed to the°condi-tions\\nconditions of physical change. There is presented to us the°diffi-culty\\ndifficulty, not only of getting the moral out of the non-moral, but\\nout of that which, if it be in the ethical sphere at all, is\\nimmoral. The ideal of the physical world is superiority in\\nstrength or skill; the ideal in the ethical world is community\\nof good, moral equality.\\nI should not mention this point—much less dwell upon\\nit—if it seemed to me merely a logical or dialectic difficulty\\nin the theory, which may be got over by a readjustment of\\nstatement. On the contrary, it appears to me to touch the\\nfundamental fallacy of physical ethics. It is not an objection\\nwhich can be met by showing that enlightened self-interest\\nwill necessarily develop benevolence, or that egoism will\\nmiss its end unless it has due regard to the feelings and\\npurposes of others, and thus become altruistic. If any one\\ndesire, it may be here conceded that benevolence came into\\nexistence when men saw that, because of the identity of their\\n\\n ― 215 ―\\n                            \\ninterests with those of others, it was well for them to pay\\nattention to the interests of others and to include the latter in\\nthe struggle for their own well-being. The difficulty is, that\\nthis assumes the whole point at issue, the very nerve of the\\ndiscussion, viz., the existence of an identity of interests and\\nthe more or less conscious recognition of it. This is the very\\nessence and meaning of the moral order: grant this, and any\\ndevelopment whatever of particular virtues and duties is\\nhypothetically conceivable. Omit this identity and the°recog-nition\\nrecognition of it in some poor way, though it be only in feeling,\\nand there is absolutely no ground for the evolution of any\\nvirtue.\\nIf anything is clearly recognized to be a fact, and is\\nrecognized as such by all schools, there is a radical twist in\\nman\\'s intellectual nature, comparable apparently to original\\nsin in his theological make-up, which causes him to ignore\\nthat fact, though it be central, or else use it in any way that\\nseems good to him, though the meaning of the fact be the\\npoint at issue. Such has been the fate of the fact of the\\nidentity of men\\'s interests, of that community in the good\\nwhich makes the welfare of one the welfare of all. This is\\nsuch an undoubted, patent fact to modern moralists, that\\nthey mostly take it for granted before beginning to theorize.\\nBut this identity, this community, is, nevertheless, the very\\nmoral problem which demands solution at their hands. To\\nsay that because of this solidarity, this union of interests,\\nmen become altruistic and benevolent, and so on, is simply\\nto say, that because of a moral order men live in a moral\\norder. The real question is, What is involved in this moral\\norder? what does it mean?—and this remains untouched.\\nThe true inquiry to be put in this matter is not,°there-fore\\ntherefore, how, granted an identity of interests, conduct changes\\nfrom self-regarding into other-regarding, nor even whether\\nsuch conduct ceases thereby to be selfish, but whether such\\nan identity of interests as is here postulated can be got out of\\nthe physical order, or whether it be not radically inconsistent\\nwith it. The answer which the physical evolutionist gives,\\nwhen he recognizes the problem at all, is an equivoke. There\\nmust be an identity of interests, he says, because all forms of\\nanimal life are differentiated varieties of one fundamental\\n\\n ― 216 ―\\n                            \\nform: there is an actual solidarity between them; they are\\nrelated, they make up one whole, by the very law of their\\nexistence. Such an answer seems conclusive because of the\\nbeautiful completeness with which it begs the question. It\\nmerely says that because there is a physical community of\\norigin there must be an ethical community of end. Does,\\nthen, the shark, which devours his prey, afford us an object\\nlesson in morals? a satisfactory demonstration of the unity of\\nall life in the common sharing in a good? But we are not\\nobliged to resort to examples to show, ad captandum, the\\nutter inadequacy of such a view. The logical ambiguity upon\\nwhich it rests is easily made evident. The fact that animals\\nhave a common animal origin does not prove that they have\\na common interest in life; the fact that all have before\\nthemselves the same end, namely, survival, does not prove\\nthat all have an equal share in this end. How have they been\\ndeveloped from their one source? By rivalry, by struggle, by\\ngaining a good at the expense of others, by differentiation of\\ninterests, by stronger weapons of attack, by superior°meth-ods\\nmethods of defense, by multiplying so that others are crowded\\nout. Physical oneness of origin is only the more convincing\\ntestimony to actual clash and conflict of aims. Where is\\nthere room for identity of interests, and this not by way of\\naccident or sporadic occurrence, but as the fundamental,\\nradical, all-important fact? And, again, how shall they all\\nattain the common end—survival? Ah! they shall not all\\nattain it, and those which do shall attain it at the expense of\\nthe others: so careless is nature of types and of individuals! I\\nhave insisted upon this fact of rivalry and competition, to an\\nundue extent perhaps; for, logically, it is a work of°superero-gation\\nsupererogation. It is not necessary to prove that the ethical ideal and\\nthe natural process are opposed. But it is necessary for the\\nphysical moralist to show that the natural process can°pro-duce\\nproduce a community of interest, a good which does not admit\\nof competition, one which belongs with equal right to all.\\nAnd how can he do this? What has he to offer, except the\\nrepetition of a physical unity of origin, which, however true\\nin its place, is utterly irrelevant to the ethical unity of aim or\\nideal? But, in fact, he rarely goes so far back as this. He\\ncontents himself with showing that, since there is among\\n\\n ― 217 ―\\n                            \\nmen a certain unity of interests, the recognition of this unity\\nis constantly growing and becoming a more efficient force.\\nIn other words, he begins by assuming that moral order\\nwhich he professes to explain. He comes to do this, we may\\nsuppose, by a process not unlike the following: Men have\\nbeen developed by a process of physical evolution; there is\\nactually among men a community of interests, a certain\\noneness of aim, therefore the former produced the latter. All\\nthat is further necessary is to show how the latter in its\\nextension has evolved the various recognized forms of°moral-ity\\nmorality. But this is an inversion of the true logic. Valid thinking\\nwould say that, since we have here a community of interest,\\na oneness of end, which cannot be the product of a physical\\nprocess, there must have been something at work besides\\nphysical evolution. Since we nowhere find man except in\\nsome relations of unity with other men,—be it in the family,\\nin the tribe, in the nation, or in humanity itself,—we°no-where\\nnowhere find man except as already living in the consciousness\\nof a moral order, an order which binds him to other men in a\\ncommunity of good. If, then, we find this rude and for the\\nmost part non-moral condition developing into higher and\\nhigher moral states, it is but the flowering and fruitage of\\nthe moral germ already there. It is but the wider recognition\\nof that oneness of man with man which is the essential\\nfeature of the moral life as distinguished from the natural.\\nIn short, the reasonings of the physical moralists gain\\nmost of their suggestiveness and all of their conclusiveness\\nbecause they unconsciously assume a moral environment as\\nwell as a physical, in relation to which the life of man goes\\non. Grant that a specifically moral order exists,—and a°the-ory\\ntheory of evolution may tell us much as to how this moral order\\nhas been realized in social and individual life in the past,—it\\nmay give us suggestions as to the use of means of further\\nrealization in the future; but it is forever helpless in calling\\ninto existence the moral order.\\nBut we must go on to the second point. Admit now that\\npurely natural processes may succeed in developing a°cer-tain\\ncertain end and in bringing into consciousness a knowledge of\\nthis end, and yet we have no ethical end. The mere fact that\\nthe physical universe as such is making towards a certain\\n\\n ― 218 ―\\n                            \\ngoal does not decide that man should aim at the same goal.\\nWhat is wanted is, not a goal for the universe, but a goal for\\nman. The ethical ideal is an ideal for personality. The°physi-cal\\nphysical evolutionist solves this difficulty by ignoring it. Having\\nconvinced himself that the processes of nature are tending\\ntowards a certain result, and that man is included in these\\nprocesses, it seems natural enough to conclude that this\\nresult is the end, the ideal, for man also. It is difficult to\\navoid forming the conclusion that here, too, he is a victim of\\na logical ambiguity, a confusion between end as something\\nactual and end as something ideal.\\nWe may be willing to admit at this stage that the°uni-verse\\nuniverse is tending towards a perfect unity in variety, a°com-plete\\ncomplete harmony, towards abundance and efficiency of life,\\nadjustment of an existence in its environment, or towards\\nany other of the many ends which have been suggested; but\\nthis is only to say that their last term is such and such, that,\\nwhen the physical processes have been going on long\\nenough, such and such a condition of affairs will actually\\ncome about. In short, what evolution presumably presents us\\nwith is an actual end; what we want in ethics is an ideal end,\\nsomething towards which man should direct his conduct.\\nNow, this objection may be interpreted to mean that\\nthe mere fact that the universe is going to come out so and so\\nin the long run does not constitute any reason why we\\nshould act accordingly,—that it offers no authority, no°ele-ment\\nelement of obligation, that it utters no \"ought.\" \"Will be\" is\\nonly a way of saying \"is\": it is only \"is\" projected in time.\\nEthics demands an ideal which says \"ought,\" irrespective of\\nthe \"is.\" But this objection, however cogent, would lead us\\nto the discussion of the subject of choice, for obligation is\\nthe objective correlate of choice. Obligation has no meaning\\nwithout choice. It expresses a relation which exists between\\nthe object-matter and the subject-choosing. And as we°de-cided\\ndecided to leave the subject of choice out of consideration at\\nthis time, the objection, interpreted in this way, does not fall\\nin the present discussion.\\nWhat, then, is meant by it? In substance this: an end\\nwhich is man\\'s end, whether ethical or not, must be one\\nwhich he has himself the power of realizing; it must stand in\\n\\n ― 219 ―\\n                            \\na direct and personal relation to him. All talk about an\\nethical ideal is utter nonsense unless man has, or rather is,\\nan end in himself. It is not enough that there be an end\\nwhich is worked out through man as an instrument; man\\nmust himself work out this end. Unless the term \"ethics\" is\\nto be extended so as to lose all specific meaning, it cannot\\nmean the behavior, the conduct, of the universe at large: it\\nmust mean the conduct of man. It implies that man has a\\ncertain end which he is to fulfill, to whose realization he is to\\ndevote his life.\\nCertainly, the evolutionist may say, but the very°advan-tage\\nadvantage of the theory of evolution is that in showing the end of\\nthe universe it also shows the end of man. Such reasoning\\nappears to me to be on a par with that example which\\nenlivens the treatment of fallacies in our text-books of°for-mal\\nformal logic: The end of anything is its perfection; death is the\\nend of life; therefore, death is the perfection of life. The\\nterm \"end\" when we speak of the universe means its last\\nterm, the direction towards which it is actually tending; the\\nterm \"end\" when we speak of the ethical end of man means\\nthe goal to which he is to direct his attention, that to which\\nhe is, so far as in him lies, to give reality. But there is a\\nfeeling, and one upon the whole well-grounded, that purely\\nlogical objections are not worth much; that they serve to trip\\nup an opponent in argument, to convict him of°inconsis-tency\\ninconsistency, rather than to establish any truth. So we must develop\\nthis line of thought somewhat.\\nAccording to the physical evolutionist, a given man is\\nonly one term in the revolving cycles of nature; he is the\\nmechanical product of past changes; he is one step towards\\nfuture change. He is a link in an endless chain. He is a\\nconsequent of antecedent states; he is precedent to coming\\nstates. The dashing waves have given birth to him, one\\neddy, in their endless motion. He comes into existence as the\\nmechanical result of past motions, he passes out of existence\\nas he dissolves into other motions. He appears as a°tempo-rary\\ntemporary unity, but in reality he is a mere part of a boundless\\naggregate. In other words, if we conceive of the universe as\\na whole, and then conceive it as having a certain end, on the\\ntheory of mechanical evolution, man can only be one means\\n\\n ― 220 ―\\n                            \\ntowards this end. He is an incident as regards the present\\nstate of things; he is an instrument as regards the future. He\\nmay be one form through which the course of evolution\\npasses; but that is all that he can be. What, then, in bald\\nAnglo-Saxon, is the sense of talking about the goal of the\\nprocess of evolution being a goal for man, except that it be\\nsomething in which he is absorbed, swallowed up, forever\\nlost? If man is a mere means in bringing about a certain\\ngoal, how can he have any end in that sense of the word\\nwhich is necessary to constitute ethical action? Can it be laid\\ndown as the ultimate law of human conduct: Thou shalt\\nmake thyself a means towards an end in which thou hast\\nneither part nor lot? The doctrine which is reputed to have\\nbeen current at some periods in theological circles, namely,\\nthat man ought to be willing to be damned for the glory of\\nGod, pales into insignificance by the side of such a command\\nlaid down as the sole and ultimate law of ethical action. And\\nyet, if man be interpreted solely by the theory of physical\\nevolution, the only possible significance of the statement that\\nthe end of the process of evolution is also the end for man is\\nthat man is a means towards this end.\\nBut this ambiguity between end as an actual last term\\noccurring at some future time, and as an ideal forever°pres-ent\\npresent in the way of a norm for action, is so deeply rooted in\\nthe consciousness of the times that we cannot yet dismiss the\\nmatter. I imagine that I can hear some one saying that these\\npast utterances are a needless confusing of a simple matter.\\nThe law of evolution shows whither the process of things is\\ntending; from this it is an obvious deduction that the°con-duct\\nconduct of man consists in furthering this end. The end cannot\\nbe brought about all at once, but there is progress towards\\nit, and it is the part of man to help on this progress. But, just\\nas we saw before that attempts to derive the moral order\\nfrom natural processes got all their force from an°uncon-scious\\nunconscious assumption of a moral order, a spiritual environment,\\nalready existing, so this answer derives its apparent value\\nfrom its assumption that there is an ethical ideal already\\nexisting. Granted that there is such a thing as an ethical\\nideal, and we may, at this point, concede that the law of\\nevolution can determine what ^it is, it can supply content to\\n\\n ― 221 ―\\n                            \\nthe otherwise empty form. But what we have been urging is\\nthat physical processes, mechanical laws of the universe,\\ncannot give birth to any ethical ideal. They may conceivably\\nimpel the world onwards towards a certain final outcome; but\\nwhere does the idea of an end for man\\'s conduct emerge? It\\ndoes not emerge; it is only taken for granted. We have here\\nanother evidence of the truth, that, if a fact be only common\\nand certain, it will be used to support a tottering theory,\\neven when the very existence of the fact is good witness to\\nthe worthlessness of the theory. The problem which lies\\nbefore the physical evolutionist is: How does there come to\\nbe an ethical ideal, and what is involved in its existence? But\\nthe physical evolutionist, with an instinctive feeling of his\\nhelplessness before such a question, passes it by, and°assum-ing\\nassuming that there is an ethical ideal, goes on to show how the\\ntheory of evolution determines what it is. Instead of°answer-ing\\nanswering the question which demands response, he takes it for\\ngranted that an answer has been given, and substitutes\\nanother for it. How does the idea of a natural end or goal,\\nthe final outcome of the universe, give birth to the°concep-tion\\nconception of an ethical end, an ideal of human conduct? To this\\nquestion he returns, in substance, the reply: There is, of\\ncourse, an ethical ideal; and the great merit of physical\\nethics is, that it reveals definitely and with demonstrable\\naccuracy the nature of the ideal.\\nNow, this paper is not written to deny that there is an\\nethical ideal; but this recognized existence of an end of\\nhuman conduct must not be taken as a matter of course\\nwhen the test of the efficiency of a theory is precisely an\\nability to account for this existence. The case stands here\\njust as it stood with the former objection. I was not there\\ndenying that as matter of fact there is a community of\\ninterests, a solidarity of humanity, which allows us to°postu-late\\npostulate a good in whose realization all men are to share. The\\npoint was that this identity, this harmony, is a spiritual\\nprinciple, an ideal which cannot be got out of the physical\\nprocesses by any amount of manipulation. And I am not now\\ndenying that, as matter of fact, there is an ethical ideal in\\nview of which all sane men live, move, and have their being\\nin varying degrees of completeness. The point is that this\\n\\n ― 222 ―\\n                            \\nethical ideal is a spiritual conception, one which demands for\\nits justification an ideal way of looking at the universe, and\\nthat natural processes have no such life in them as will\\nenable them to bring to birth such a principle.\\nWe pass on accordingly to our third objection. We\\nhave so far allowed to pass unchallenged the assumption\\nthat the physical processes have an end, a tendency, a goal, a\\nresult, for which they are making. We have only denied that\\nthis end gave any means for determining the end and ideal\\nfor man\\'s conduct. We have now to recognize that this\\nadmission has no justification. There is in nature, as natural,\\nno end; there is no final result; there is no outcome; there is\\nno tendency. None are more ready to admit this fact, or\\nrather to assert it, than these same scientific men when these\\nare not engaged in founding ethical systems. There is then\\nunanimity of agreement with Spinoza, that the idea of an\\nend in nature is a figment of the human imagination. Final\\ncauses have no right in physical explanations, no basis in\\nphysical processes, they tell us. And, indeed, speaking from\\ntheir standpoint, they tell us correctly. The idea of end\\ninvolves the conception, first, of the universe as a whole,\\nand, secondly, of a certain idea or purpose which the°uni-verse\\nuniverse is fulfilling. Now, the categories of physical science do\\nnot enable us to lay hold on either of these factors. Scientific\\nmen are constantly telling us that they are not concerned\\nwith the nature of Being in itself; they have not concerned\\nthemselves with the Absolute. Such empty abstractions,\\nsuch unattainable notions, they gladly leave to the°metaphy-sicians\\nmetaphysicians. For their part, they have their hands full finding out\\nabout the relative and the phenomenal. Now, this simply\\nmeans that they deal with the various connections which\\nexist among facts, finding out one here, ascertaining°an-other\\nanother there; it means that they deal with the world partially,\\nnot attempting to see it as a whole. The nature of things as\\nthey really are, the Absolute, on the other hand, ^is precisely\\nthings taken as a whole, viewed as one comprehensive unity,\\nself-related, because involving all relations within itself, and\\nself-explanatory.\\nBut we are not dependent upon the witness of authority\\nmerely. These scientific men are not giving us an account of\\n\\n ― 223 ―\\n                            \\ntheir own individual predilections; they are stating°some-thing\\nsomething that exists in the nature of the case. Science, as°physi-cal\\nphysical, deals with objects coexistent in space, and events°se-quent\\nsequent in time, and connected by the laws of mechanical\\ncausation. That is to say, it sees the universe not as a whole,\\nbut as conditioned by space and time, and shows the world\\nnot as self-explanatory, but as in every detail requiring\\nexplanation outside of itself. No natural fact gives any°rea-son\\nreason for itself; to ascertain its reason we must go outside of it,\\nand find its condition. In a threefold way, then, the world of\\nscience is not a whole; it is only a world of progressus ad\\ninfinita, whether of space, of time, or of causes. Hence the\\nabsurdity of attempting to find any final term, any outcome,\\nany result. Constant change, transformation of motion, is\\nthe law of nature. We cannot stop here nor there, and say,\\nBehold the end, the intention of it all. We are all familiar, ad\\nnauseam, with the arguments which show that in the°physi-cal\\nphysical realm there is and can be no first cause; the fact that\\nthere can be no end, no unifying tendency, is simply the\\nobverse of this.\\nAgain: end, if it mean anything, signifies the fulfilling\\nof purpose, the realizing of an idea. The end, the goal of the\\nuniverse, cannot be a last term; it cannot be something\\nwhich the past ages have been obliged to do without, and\\nwhich some happy moment in the future will see ushered\\ninto existence. Such an end would be an incident, an°acci-dent\\naccident rather, nay, a catastrophe. The end, in any intelligible\\nsense, must be a unity which binds together every event,\\nevery existence. It must have the same reference to an event\\nwhich occurred a million years ago, as to one which will\\noccur ten million years from now. In other words, it is that\\nwhich interprets, which gives meaning to, which unifies all\\nprocesses. And such a unity cannot be an object which exists\\nin some place, or an event which occurs at some time. It\\ncannot be one conditioned existence in a series of conditioned\\nexistences. It can be only an idea, a spiritual, an ideal unity\\nof purpose and meaning.\\nThe conception of end, therefore, has no place in the\\nlexicon of the physicist. It is consistent only with a°teleologi-cal\\nteleological interpretation of the world; one which sees it as the\\n\\n ― 224 ―\\n                            \\nembodiment of reason, and the manifestation of intelligent\\npurpose. We get now very close to the truth of the matter.\\nThe arguments of the physical evolutionists, when they offer\\nthemselves as constructive moralists, are to the effect that,\\nno matter if our arguments do show that there cannot be an\\nend or goal in the physical world, facts show there is one. It\\nis because of this, they further say, that they are not°incon-sistent\\ninconsistent in denying teleology, and in yet recognizing an end or\\ngoal as an ethical ideal. They deny teleology as a matter of\\nspeculation, as a matter of reasoning; but they recognize the\\ngoal simply as a fact, just as they would recognize any other\\nfact presented to their inspection. They are not concerned\\nwith the idea of purpose, or of final causation; but just as\\nthey see that a certain union of hydrogen and oxygen°pro-duces\\nproduces water, so they see a certain tendency going on—one\\nwhich has transformed the world from a homogeneous°neb-ula\\nnebula, barren of all distinction or intelligent worth, into the\\ncomplex universe of physical, biological, and social facts\\nwhich now confronts us. The law of evolution shows the\\nworld, together with the various subordinate departments\\nof reality included within it, changing from an incoherent,\\nindefinite homogeneity into a coherent, definite, or unified\\nheterogeneity. This latter condition, then, this differentiated\\nunity of related factors, is the end implied in all physical\\nchange. It is there as a fact; and beyond this our scientific\\nmen say that they decline to go. The fact is enough for\\nthem, without losing themselves in metaphysical subtleties.\\nAnd all this, it is not to be denied, strikes us as having\\na certain force. But where does it get this force? Simply\\nfrom an assumption of what is to be explained. The virtual\\nassertion of these men is that if you will only assert a fact\\nwith sufficient resoluteness, you may deny, with equal°reso-luteness\\nresoluteness, the need of any inquiry into its meaning. No one—\\nat least no one who is convinced that ethics has its basis in\\nthe rational and spiritual constitution of reality-denies that\\nthere is a tendency towards an end, an end which is°de-scribed\\ndescribed well enough in the terms of Mr. Spencer, but more\\nsimply as a perfect harmony, a unity in variety. But the\\nquestion is, What is implied in the existence of this fact?\\nAnd this question is not got rid of, much less answered, by\\n\\n ― 225 ―\\n                            \\nany amount of ponderous reiteration of the fact. We do not\\ndeny it: we inquire whether it is consistent with the theory\\nwhich makes such use of it, or whether it necessarily°in-volves\\ninvolves that reality is spiritual to its very core. Certainly, this\\nis not the first time in the history of thought when a theory\\nhas sought to eke out its insufficiency with the reiterated\\ndisplay of the very fact which is most incompatible with the\\ntheory. The ordinary mind hears the theory; it recognizes\\nthe fact, and carries over the strength of the fact to make up\\nfor the weakness of the theory. But it is never possible to\\nsuppress completely the inquiry concerning the relation°be-tween\\nbetween the two. And in this case we would say that the fact\\nthat the universe is seen to be tending towards a goal, and is\\npossessed of an end, is simply evidence that the purely\\nphysical theory of evolution, however good in its place,°ut-terly\\nutterly fails to work when applied to the universe as a whole.\\nWhen we come to this, we must substitute a teleological\\ntheory of evolution for the mechanical: we must read°physi-cal\\nphysical causes in terms of rational purpose.\\nSuch a procedure, therefore, as the physical moralist\\noffers us has at least two faults. It begs the question whether\\naction towards an end is derivable from physical categories;\\nand it falls into the plight of employing a fact to deny that\\nwhich alone gives it its existence and significance, namely,\\nthe incorporation of ethical ends in the very structure of\\nreality. We must, therefore, continue to deny that the°physi-cal\\nphysical universe as merely physical has any end or goal.\\nThe end of the somewhat long and tedious road which\\nwe have been following is that we cannot admit the claims of\\nphysical science to be the founder of the ethical system of\\nthe coming man. We have to deny it, because (1) ethics\\ndeals with an end, and there is no place for an end in nature\\nas confined to space and time; and because (2) even if there\\nwere an end in the universe, this would not of itself°consti-tute\\nconstitute the ideal for human conduct; and because (3) science is\\nutterly unable to establish the essential feature of the ethical\\nideal, its insistence upon the identity of humanity in their\\nrelation to it.\\nWhat is the bearing of this and similar protests? Is it\\nthe mingled objurgation and lamentation of those who see\\n\\n ― 226 ―\\n                            \\ntheir monopoly disappearing? Is it the clamor of those who\\nwant to cheapen the worth of goods offered by others, in\\norder that, when their own inevitable bankruptcy comes,\\nthey may dispose of their own stock and good-will with the\\nleast possible loss? So it would seem if we hearken to some.\\nBut it may be that the denial of the possibility of physical\\nscience to formulate a constructive ethics does not arise from\\na carping exclusive spirit, but from the profound conviction\\nthat in a world such as physical science takes cognizance of\\nthere is no ground for morals, no place where the moral life\\nmay so much as set its foot; and in the conviction that a\\nspiritual interpretation of reality can alone found a truly\\nscientific ethics and justify the living ways of man to man.\\n\\n ― 227 ―\\n                            \\nThe Ethics of Democracy [First published as No. 1, Second Series, University of Michigan\\nPhilosophical Papers.

When\\nthe contradiction is between a manner of life seemingly\\nbecoming universal, and a theory of this manner which\\nmakes it almost worthless, it is yet more striking. Such a\\ncontradiction we have in the present status of democracy. As\\nit gains practical extension in the affairs of society, it is\\ngetting lower theoretical appreciation. While it has never\\nhad such an actual hold on life as at present, no observer can\\ndeny, I believe, that its defenders have never been so°apolo-getic\\napologetic; its detractors so aggressive and pessimistic. To them,\\nthis state of affairs is no doubt additional evidence of the\\ntruth of their position; the more men see of democracy, the\\nless they like it. The contradiction is thus easily accounted\\nfor. But those who believe that the practical instincts of\\nmen, as witnessed in a long stretch of history and over a\\nbroad area of political existence, do not easily go wholly\\nwrong; and that in the case of a conflict of practical life with\\ntheoretical criticism, the latter is most apt to be at fault, will\\nbe likely to demand a revision of theory. Without further\\ninquiry into the causes of this break between the beliefs of\\neducated men, and the actual tendencies of political°organ-isms\\norganisms, I wish to make one of its recent manifestations the\\nexcuse for an examination into the basal conception, the\\nideal of democracy. This is Sir Henry Maine\\'s remarkable\\nbook on Popular Government.\\nThis book gives the ablest and most coherent°exposi-tion\\nexposition of one school of political philosophy known to me, for it\\nrests upon wide historical knowledge and is the product of\\nkeen analysis. Its examination accordingly will give not a\\n\\n ― 228 ―\\n                            \\ncriticism of Sir Henry Maine\\'s individual views, but the\\nmeans of coming to some conclusions regarding the°funda-mental\\nfundamental nature of democracy. The thoroughness of Maine\\'s\\nposition may be got at from the fact that he sees in°democ-racy\\ndemocracy no historical meaning, no realization of any idea. It is\\nbut the \"product of a whole series of accidents.\" Its future\\nprospects are as uncertain as its past is brief. It is \"the most\\nfragile and insecure\" of governments; since its introduction\\ngovernment is more instable than it has been since the time\\nof the Pretorian Guards. Judging from past experience it\\nalways \"ends in producing monstrous and morbid forms of\\nmonarchy and aristocracy.\" His account of its actual°tenden-cies\\ntendencies is such as his summary of its past career and°vaticina-tion\\nvaticination of its future might lead us to expect. \"Its legislation is a\\nwild burst of destructive wantonness; an arbitrary°over-throw\\noverthrow of all existing institutions, followed by a longer period\\nin which its principles put an end to all social and political\\nactivity, and result in a dead level of ultra-conservatism,\"\\nfor, as he oracularly remarks: \"There can be no delusion\\ngreater than that democracy is a progressive form of°govern-ment\\ngovernment.\" \"The establishment of the masses in power is of\\nblackest omen for all legislation founded on scientific°opin-ion\\nopinion.\" The summary of the whole matter is the dictum°ap-provingly\\napprovingly quoted from Strauss, \"History is a sound°aristo-crat\\naristocrat.\"\\nAs it is his theoretical, his philosophical basis that is in\\nquestion here, these views may pass without question,°al-though\\nalthough I confess that his ideas regarding the origin of\\ndemocracy seem to be based upon a view of history which\\ndenies to it all meaning except that arising from the°acciden-tal\\naccidental juxtaposition of circumstance; that his forebodings for its\\nfuture rest upon an irrelevant basis; and that the supposed\\ndestructiveness is due to the occasional necessity of doing\\naway with the evils engendered of aristocracy; and that the\\nlegislative infertility attributed to it goes rather to show that\\nin every state except the democratic, the masses of the\\npeople are more opposed to change and progress than the\\nfew. And so it may well be. But the charge lies against the\\nform of government which breeds such a mass, not against\\ndemocracy.\\n\\n ― 229 ―\\n                            \\nBut leaving these considerations, we must come to\\nMaine\\'s philosophy of democracy and government. Maine\\'s\\nfundamental position, the one which he considers°indispen-sable\\nindispensable to any understanding of the matter, is that \"democracy\\nis only a form of government.\" All views which attribute to\\nit any significance or functions not based upon the clear\\ninsight that it is only one among various forms of°govern-ment\\ngovernment are to be ruled out. This is our starting point. The next\\nstep is as to the meaning of government. Here the view of\\nHobbes, as worked out by the analytic school of Bentham\\nand Austin, is virtually adopted. Government is simply that\\nwhich has to do with the relation of subject to sovereign, of\\npolitical superior to inferior. This is the second point. The\\nthird concerns that which is taken as the distinguishing\\nmark of governments—that which differentiates democracy\\nfrom other forms. This is quantitative or numerical. If the\\nsovereign is one or few, the subject a multitude, we have\\nmonarchy or aristocracy. If the sovereign is the multitude,\\nthe subject a small number, we have democracy. For it is a\\ntrait of democracy that the apparent ruler is in reality the\\nservant; the seeming subject the true ruler.\\nWe have here in skeleton outline the main points of\\nthis school of political philosophy. But they must be°ex-panded\\nexpanded somewhat. Democracy is the rule of the Many, of\\nthe Mass. That is the essential point. Democracy is nothing\\nbut a numerical aggregate, a conglomeration of units.°De-mocracy\\nDemocracy is, accordingly, the most difficult form of°govern-ment\\ngovernment. For while it is conceivable that one man or a few men\\nshould have a common will, in no intelligible sense can a\\nmultitude be said to exercise will (Maine, p. 88). All°gov-ernment\\ngovernment is based on the exercise of volition, and yet a\\nmultitude cannot be said to have a common will (Maine, p.\\n202). It must be manufactured, however, in order to have\\neven a semblance of government, and Maine says the only\\npowers adequate to bring about this artificial unity are party\\nand corruption,—means of which, as he says, one is°inju-rious\\ninjurious to the intellect, the other to the morals of the°govern-ing\\ngoverning mass (Maine, p. 98). Democracy being this numerical\\naggregate, it follows, of course, that in it sovereignty or\\npolitical power is minced into morsels and each man\\'s°por-tion\\n ― 230 ―\\n                            \\nportion is almost infinitesimally small (Maine, p. 29). Citizens\\nin a democracy are \"fragments of political power\"; the\\ngrowth of democracy is the \"process of cutting up political\\npower into petty fragments.\" Here we have the adequate\\ntheoretical explanation of the instability and the°unprogres-sive\\nunprogressive character of democracy. Democracy, again, being a\\nnumerical aggregate, the multitude, although the ruler and\\nmaster, is obliged to delegate his power, since being a°multi-tude\\nmultitude he cannot himself exercise it, to the so-called ruler\\n(Maine, p. 81). In democracy, in short, the government is\\nan external power formed by a process of delegation.\\nIt will be seen accordingly, that the gist of the matter\\nlies in the question whether democracy is adequately°de-scribed\\ndescribed as the rule of the many, whether the numerical\\nattribute of democracy is primary and causal, or secondary\\nand derived. From the decision of this question will flow the\\nfurther answers to questions regarding, first, the nature of\\nsovereignty, secondly, the relation of government to the\\nstate, or the adequacy of the delegation theory, and, finally,\\nas to whether democracy is adequately described as only a\\nform of government.\\nIt is worth remarking that it is only superficially that\\nMaine has the authority of Aristotle for defining democracy\\nsimply as the rule of the many. Aristotle, indeed, uses the\\nnumerical mark as the basis of his classification, but in his\\nanalysis he realizes what Maine never does: that in reality it\\nis laws which govern the state, and that the men, whether\\nfew or many, are but the instruments of the law. Many\\nresults follow, of course, from this latter trait; it is not a\\nmatter of indifference whether few or many rule; but the\\nessential characteristic of each state is found, after all, in its\\nform of constitution and organic law. And certainly the\\nwhole drift of political theory since the abstract natural\\nright philosophy of the French Revolution has been towards\\nthe conception that society is an organism, and government\\nan expression of its organic nature. If this be so, it is no\\nmore adequately defined by any merely quantitative°concep-tion\\nconception than a tree is defined by counting the number of cells\\nwhich constitute it.\\nWhat makes it more surprising that Maine should\\nadopt the numerical aggregation, the multitude conception,\\n\\n ― 231 ―\\n                            \\nis the fact that in times past he has dealt such vigorous\\nblows against a theory which is the natural and inevitable\\noutcome of this conception. The \"Social Contract\" theory of\\nstates has never been more strongly attacked than by Maine,\\nand yet the sole source of this theory is just such a°concep-tion\\nconception of society, as a mass of units, as the one Maine here\\nadopts. The essence of the \"Social Contract\" theory is not\\nthe idea of the formulation of a contract; it is the idea that\\nmen are mere individuals, without any social relations until\\nthey form a contract. The method by which they get out of\\ntheir individualistic condition is not the important matter;\\nrather this is the fact, that they are in an individualistic\\ncondition out of which they have to be got. The notion, in\\nshort, which lay in the minds of those who proposed this\\ntheory was that men in their natural state are non-social\\nunits, are a mere multitude; and that some artifice must be\\ndevised to constitute them into political society. And this\\nartifice they found in a contract which they entered into with\\none another. Maine rejects this artifice as unreal, but keeps\\nthe fundamental idea, the idea of men as a mere mass, which\\nled to it.\\nThe fact is, however, that the theory of the \"social\\norganism,\" that theory that men are not isolated non-social\\natoms, but are men only when in intrinsic relations to men,\\nhas wholly superseded the theory of men as an aggregate, as\\na heap of grains of sand needing some factitious mortar to\\nput them into semblance of order. This, indeed, does not\\nmake it incumbent upon one to accept the one theory or to\\nreject the other; the argument to authority is always open to\\nquestion; but it does make it incumbent that one rest his case\\nupon something more than a definition which begs the°ques-tion\\nquestion by its very make-up. For the picture which is drawn of\\ndemocracy is, in effect, simply an account of anarchy. To\\ndefine democracy simply as the rule of the many, as°sover-eignty\\nsovereignty chopped up into mince meat, is to define it as°abroga-tion\\nabrogation of society, as society dissolved, annihilated. When so\\ndefined, it may be easily shown to be instable to the last\\ndegree, and so difficult that a common will must be°manu-factured\\nmanufactured—if not by means of a contract, then by means of a\\ncombined action of the firm of Party and Corruption.\\nBut if we do not start with a definition of democracy\\n\\n ― 232 ―\\n                            \\nwhich makes it equivalent to the destruction of society, it\\nmay not be found so easy to derive all these evil°conse-quences\\nconsequences from it. If we start from the conception of a social\\norganism, the prima facie case stands quite otherwise. For\\nwhile in a mass, in a numerical aggregate, the ultimate\\nreality is an individual unit, and the isolated atoms are the\\n\"facts of the case,\" in an organism man is essentially a\\nsocial being. Society in its unified and structural character is\\nthe fact of the case; the non-social individual is an°abstrac-tion\\nabstraction arrived at by imagining what man would be if all his\\nhuman qualities were taken away. Society, as a real whole,\\nis the normal order, and the mass as an aggregate of isolated\\nunits is the fiction. If this be the case, and if democracy be a\\nform of society, it not only does have, but must have, a\\ncommon will; for it is this unity of will which makes it an\\norganism. A state represents men so far as they have become\\norganically related to one another, or are possessed of unity\\nof purpose and interest. But as Maine\\'s a priori definition of\\ndemocracy, based upon an exploded theory of society, does\\nnot suffice to condemn democracy, neither will a conception\\nof it which rests upon an accepted theory suffice to justify it.\\nNo one can claim that any society is wholly organized, or\\npossessed of one interest and will to the exclusion of all\\nstruggle and opposition and hostility. There are still classes\\nwithin society, circles within the classes and cliques within\\nthe circles. If it can be shown that democracy more than\\nother forms tends to multiply these subdivisions, that it\\ntends to increase this opposition; that it strengthens their\\nefficiency at the expense of the working force of the°organ-ism\\norganism—in short, that its tendencies are towards disintegration,\\ntowards mere government by the mass, on the one side, and\\nresolution into infinitesimal fragments, on the other, the case\\nagainst democracy is amply made out. But an arbitrary\\ndefinition and analysis will not serve.\\nWhat gives the democracy more than other forms of\\ngovernment the appearance of being a mere rule of a mass\\nor multitude is, without doubt, the use which it makes of\\nindividual suffrage on the one hand and majority rule on the\\nother. Since it thus appears to decide all questions of policy\\nand of men by mere weighing of numbers, it is easy to\\n\\n ― 233 ―\\n                            \\nrepresent democracy as concerned for the most part with a\\nproblem in arithmetic. Analytic abstraction, having°per-chance\\nperchance already deprived men of all their qualities due to\\ntheir social relations, now proceeds further to reduce them\\ninto merely numerical individuals, into ballot-projecting\\nunits. Then the mere accident of a few bare units more or\\nless on this side or that, seems, by bare numerical°prepon-derance\\npreponderance, to form the will of the people in this direction or\\nthat. Such is the theoretical analysis of democracy most\\noften presented to us. Many of its upholders have no more\\nadequate idea of it than this, and rest for their final support\\non the fact that after all the numerical majority would have,\\nin case of an appeal to arms, the brute force to coerce the\\nminority. Such presentations come off very poorly when\\ncompared with the sketch of an ideal aristocracy, where not\\nmere stress of numbers, but superiority in wisdom, elevation\\nin goodness, enable the few having these qualities to guide\\nthe mass without them. All Carlyle\\'s political writings rest\\ntheir lamentation on just such a conception of democracy as\\nthis numerical one, which he has set forth in a more many-\\nsided, vivid and forcible way than even Sir Henry Maine.\\nAnd the educated men of to-day, who have been trained\\nexclusively in the school of physical science, with its°tenden-cies\\ntendencies towards mechanical and mathematical abstraction,°al-most\\nalmost without exception have no notion of the meaning of\\ndemocracy other than this.\\nBut the student of society has constantly to be on his\\nguard against the abstract and purely mechanical notions\\nintroduced from the physical sciences. If he will beware of\\nsuch abstractions, he will remember that men cannot be\\nreduced for political purposes, any more than for any other,\\nto bare figure ones, marks to be placed in rows set over\\nagainst one another. A man when he comes to vote does not\\nput off from him, like a suit of old clothes, his character, his\\nwealth, his social influence, his devotion to political°inter-ests\\ninterests, and become a naked unit. He carries with him in his\\nvoting all the influence that he should have, and if he°de-serves\\ndeserves twice as much as another man, it is safe to say that he\\ndecides twice as many votes as that other man. Even if his\\ncharacter is corrupt, and his devotion to politics is from\\n\\n ― 234 ―\\n                            \\nmotives of pelf, it yet remains true that he votes, not as a\\nmere unit, but as a representative of the social organism. It\\nis only because society allows him, nay, grants him power on\\nsuch grounds, that he can use it. His very corruption is the\\nexpression of society through him. A vote, in other words, is\\nnot an impersonal counting of one; it is a manifestation of\\nsome tendency of the social organism through a member of\\nthat organism.\\nBut this only touches the matter. There still appears to\\nbe in majority rule an instrument for putting all on a dead\\nlevel, and allowing numerical surplus to determine the°out-come\\noutcome. But the heart of the matter is found not in the voting\\nnor in the counting the votes to see where the majority lies.\\nIt is in the process by which the majority is formed. The\\nminority are represented in the policy which they force the\\nmajority to accept in order to be a majority; the majority\\nhave the right to \"rule\" because their majority is not the mere\\nsign of a surplus in numbers, but is the manifestation of the\\npurpose of the social organism. Were this not so, every\\nelection would be followed by a civil war; there would be no\\nneed of writing concerning the weakness of popular°govern-ment\\ngovernment; it would be the only striking fact about democracy.\\nI know of no one by whom this matter of majority rule is\\nbetter stated than by the late Governor Tilden—whose\\nopinion is the more worth quoting in this connection because\\nhe too saw in democracy only a device for carrying on°govern-ment\\ngovernment. He calls attention to the fact that generally the°dif-ference\\ndifference between the minority and the majority party in a\\ngeneral election does not exceed five per cent of the entire\\nvote. Instead of jumping at the conclusion that thus a small\\nproportion of the population really determines the policy of\\nthe whole, he sees that the small numerical difference is in\\nreality testimony to the coinciding of the two parties. \"The\\nminority,\" he says, \"adopts enough of the ideas of the°ma-jority\\nmajority to attract those who are nearest to the line of division;\\nand the majority in struggling to reclaim them makes°con-cessions\\nconcessions. The issue is thus constantly shifting with the°wa-vering\\nwavering tide of battle, until the policy which at last prevails\\nhas become adjusted so as nearly to represent the average\\nsense of the whole people. In shaping the policy which\\n\\n ― 235 ―\\n                            \\nemerges from the conflict the minority acts a part scarcely\\nless important than the majority.\" (Tilden, Writings and\\nSpeeches, vol. i, p. 290.) Or as he sums up the whole matter:\\n\"In trying to acquire the means to govern, the majority\\nbecomes qualified to govern.\" The only case in which such statements cease to represent facts is\\nwhen a constitutional amendment is submitted to a people, and they are\\ncompelled to vote yes or no, with no possibility of modification oramend-ment\\namendment. But this is only an argument against the plebiscitum, (for such this\\nprocess really is) not against democracy.\\n»1 When, therefore, we hear\\nthe derider of democracy discrediting it by declaring that\\nthrough manhood suffrage and majority rule all are put on\\na level, with no quality concerned but their numerical, we\\nmay be confident that he has only the most superficial view\\nof the matter, and that the process of finding out the policy\\nof the majority is the process by which the social organism\\nweighs considerations and forms its consequent judgment;\\nthat the voting of the individual represents in reality, a\\ndeliberation, a tentative opinion on the part of the whole\\norganism.\\nWe must now turn to the other side of the picture. The\\ntheory which makes of democratic society a mere mass,\\nmakes, on the other hand, the democratic citizen a mere\\nminced morsel of this mass, a disorganized fragment. If,\\nhowever, society be truly described as organic, the citizen is\\na member of the organism, and, just in proportion to the\\nperfection of the organism, has concentrated within himself\\nits intelligence and will. Disguise it as we may, this theory\\ncan have but one result, that of the sovereignty of the\\ncitizen. There are various theories which have served to\\nkeep this in the background, and to hide the fact that the\\nordinary American expression of the sovereignty of every\\nelector is not a mere exaggerated burst of individualistic\\nfeeling, fostered through crude Fourth of July patriotism,\\nbut is the logical outcome of the organic theory of society.\\nThere is the French theory which makes sovereignty\\nthe natural (that is, the pre-political, even the non-political)\\nattribute of the people; a trait inhering in the people by mere\\nstress of their including everyone within themselves,°with-out\\nwithout respect to organization. There is the German theory,\\nwhich, although recognizing professedly the organic°concep-tion\\n ― 236 ―\\n                            \\nconception, rids it of its significance in this respect by giving a\\nphysiological sense to the term, by interpreting the term in\\nanalogy with the human body. Thus Bluntschli, in spite of\\nall that there is valuable in him, cannot free himself from the\\nidea that since society is an organism it must have°some-thing\\nsomething corresponding to the division of sexes, to the limbs, to\\nthe trunk, and to the head. Just as the head represents the\\nwisdom and control of the body, so the mystic attribute of\\nsovereignty, which is diffused indeed in a vague way\\nthrough the nation, gets reality only in the aureole that rests\\nupon the monarch. The English theory, as presented by\\nHobbes and worked out by Austin, virtually makes it consist\\nin irresponsible power. According to one theory, sovereignty\\nis located in the people as a whole, one might say as a mob;\\naccording to another it is latent in the nation as a definite\\npolitical body, but manifest only in the head of the nation;\\naccording to the third (the one adopted here at least by\\nMaine) it is situated in whatever portions of the state have\\nthe power to make, alter and enforce laws without appeal. If\\nwe take the latter notion, sovereignty is simply power to do\\nthis or that. It follows that in the democratic state°(accord-ing\\n(according to Maine\\'s conception of it as a multitude) this power\\nmust be divided into fragments, each citizen having simply\\nhis fractional part of the total amount of sovereignty at\\ncommand. Thus the exercise of sovereignty is a question of\\ndivision, just as the formation of a common will is one in\\naddition. Given so much sovereignty, and so many citizens,\\nhow much does each member have? The individual, the\\nultimate unit, thus becomes an n-millionth of political\\npower. But if we really adopt the organic conception of\\nsociety, the case stands quite otherwise. The attempt to\\nmake the organic theory work only in one direction, namely,\\nas applicable to society but not to its members, is to deny the\\ntheory. This is as much an account of the individual as it is\\nof the whole. One who has really adopted the notion can say\\nnot less, but more than any one else, that society exists for\\nand by individuals. But it is because he has given up the\\nfiction of isolated unsocial units, and has realized that the\\nindividual embodies and realizes within himself the spirit\\nand will of the whole organism.\\n\\n ― 237 ―\\n                            \\nThis is not the place for an examination of the°concep-tion\\nconception of organism; but it must be remembered that it is a\\nthoroughly reciprocal conception. The animal body is not\\nthe type of an organism, because the members, the organs,\\nhave their life, after all, only as parts, conditioned by their\\nexternal space relations. They indeed participate in the life\\nof the whole, while the whole lives in them, giving them\\ntheir activity. But they are absorbed in this whole. The\\nwhole has not given its life to them so freely that they can\\ntake on the appearance of independent lives, isolated in\\nspace. The organic relation is incomplete. But human°so-ciety\\nsociety represents a more perfect organism. The whole lives\\ntruly in every member, and there is no longer the°appear-ance\\nappearance of physical aggregation, or continuity. The organism\\nmanifests itself as what it truly is, an ideal or spiritual life, a\\nunity of will. If then, society and the individual are really\\norganic to each other, then the individual is society°concen-trated\\nconcentrated. He is not merely its image or mirror. He is the\\nlocalized manifestation of its life. And if, as actually°hap-pens\\nhappens, society be not yet possessed of one will, but partially is\\none and partially has a number of fragmentary and warring\\nwills, it yet follows that so far as society has a common\\npurpose and spirit, so far each individual is not°representa-tive\\nrepresentative of a certain proportionate share of the sum total of will,\\nbut is its vital embodiment. And this is the theory, often\\ncrudely expressed, but none the less true in substance, that\\nevery citizen is a sovereign, the American theory, a doctrine\\nwhich in grandeur has but one equal in history, and that its\\nfellow, namely, that every man is a priest of God.\\nIn conception, at least, democracy approaches most\\nnearly the ideal of all social organization; that in which the\\nindividual and society are organic to each other. For this\\nreason democracy, so far as it is really democracy, is the\\nmost stable, not the most insecure, of governments. In every\\nother form of government there are individuals who are not\\norgans of the common will, who are outside of the political\\nsociety in which they live, and are, in effect, aliens to that\\nwhich should be their own commonwealth. Not°participat-ing\\nparticipating in the formation or expression of the common will, they\\ndo not embody it in themselves. Having no share in society,\\n\\n ― 238 ―\\n                            \\nsociety has none in them. Such is the origin of that body of\\nirreconcilables which Maine, with inverted logic, attributes\\nto democracy.\\nWe have thus far analyzed the popular numerical°con-ception\\nconception of democracy as bearing upon the notions of the\\ncommon will and of sovereignty. We have now to examine it\\nin its relation to the theory of government. From this°quanti-tative\\nquantitative notion it necessarily follows that government comes\\ninto being by the process stated by Maine, that of°delega-tion\\ndelegation. If society is only a mass or aggregate, it must call\\ngovernment into being by some artificial means. There then\\nexist two classes, one of governors, one of governed, and the\\nonly question is as to which is the real master, which the real\\nservant. Democracy, like every other form of government,\\nhas these two classes set over against each other, but it\\nreverses the relation existing in aristocracy. But, once\\nmore, if society be organic, the notion of two classes, one of\\nwhich is inferior to the other, falls to the ground. The basal\\nconception, here, is of unity, and all distinctions must occur\\nwithin and on account of this unity. The organism must\\nhave its spiritual organs; having a common will, it must\\nexpress it. A national consciousness which does not give\\nitself outward reality, which does not objectify itself, is like\\nany other consciousness in similar plight—simply°non-exis-tent\\nnon-existent. There is, indeed, a popular but none the less superficial\\nmode of speech which identifies the government and the\\nstate. This is as if a physiologist were to identify seeing with\\nthe eye, or even with the whole body. The eye is the body\\norganized for seeing, and just so government is the state\\norganized for declaring and executing its judgments.°Gov-ernment\\nGovernment is to the state what language is to thought; it not\\nonly communicates the purposes of the state, but in so doing\\ngives them for the first time articulation and generality.\\nThe chief bearing of this upon our present discussion\\nlies in the fact that it does away with the dualism inherent in\\nthe delegation theory. Government does not mean one class\\nor side of society set over against the other. The government\\nis not made up of those who hold office, or who sit in the\\nlegislature. It consists of every member of political society.\\nAnd this is true of democracy, not less, but more, than of\\n\\n ― 239 ―\\n                            \\nother forms. The democratic formula that government°de-rives\\nderives its powers from the consent of the governed, like the\\ntheory of the sovereignty of the political citizen, has suffered\\nas much at the hands of its friends as of its enemies; but its\\ntrue significance is not thereby destroyed. It means that in\\ndemocracy, at all events, the governors and the governed are\\nnot two classes, but two aspects of the same fact—the fact of\\nthe possession by society of a unified and articulate will. It\\nmeans that government is the organ of society, and is as\\ncomprehensive as society. Here, as before, we may reverse\\nMaine\\'s argument and say that democracy, since it more\\nfully conforms to the ideal of society, is more stable than\\naristocracy. Wherever government is a matter of birth, of\\nheredity, of wealth, of superior \"social\" standing, in a word,\\nof privilege, society is still unorganized, and in so far,°cha-otic\\nchaotic. There are two wills; the governors and the governed\\nare two separate classes. Unless there is complete despotism\\nor stagnation, there is constant clashing of the two wills\\ncontained, and a constant shifting of power. There is a\\ncondition of unstable equilibrium. What Plato said of his\\nideal state, we may with greater truth say of democracy:\\n\"What simplicity is this that you should use the term \\'state\\'\\nof any but ours! Other states may indeed be spoken of more\\ngrandiloquently and in the plural number-for they are\\nmany. Any ordinary state, however small, is indeed two\\nstates at war with each other, and in either division there are\\nmany smaller states.\" (Republic iv. 423.) And again as\\nPlato acutely remarks: \"All political changes originate in\\ndivisions of the governing power, for a government which is\\nunited, however small, cannot be moved.\" (Republic viii.\\n545.)\\nWe have completed the first part of our examination.\\nWe have considered the theory of democratic government\\nsuggested by Sir Henry Maine, so far as it relates to the\\nconception of the common will, of the individual citizen, and\\nof the origin of government. We have now to see whether\\nwe can stop with the idea of democracy as merely a form of\\ngovernment, or whether it implies something more. James\\nRussell Lowell is a man of letters, not a professed student of\\npolitics, and yet where he says of democracy that he is\\n\\n ― 240 ―\\n                            \\n\"speaking of a sentiment, a spirit, and not of a form of\\ngovernment, for this is but the outgrowth of the latter and\\nnot its cause,\" we must recognize that the weight of history\\nand of politics is on his side, as it is not on that of Maine.\\nThe conception that democracy and aristocracy are°expedi-ents\\nexpedients for reaching certain jural ends, for exercising certain\\npolice powers, for compelling obedience, and that the sole\\nquestion is as to what piece of machinery can accomplish\\nthis most efficiently, and with the greatest stability and\\neconomy, is one which has no justification outside of°ab-stract\\nabstract theory. It is the relic of the time when governmental\\npolities were regarded as articles of clothing, to be cut and\\nsewed by any acute political tailor, and fitted to any nation.\\nIt belongs to a time when it was thought that a constitution\\ncould be made ad hoc, and established on a tabula rasa of\\npast history, also manufactured with express reference to\\nthe given case. A government springs from a vast mass of\\nsentiments, many vague, some defined, of instincts, of°aspi-rations\\naspirations, of ideas, of hopes and fears, of purposes. It is their\\nreflex and their incorporation; their projection and°out-growth\\noutgrowth. Without this basis, it is worth nothing. A gust of\\nprejudice, a blow of despotism, and it falls like a card house.\\nTo say that democracy is only a form of government is like\\nsaying that home is a more or less geometrical arrangement\\nof bricks and mortar; that the church is a building with\\npews, pulpit and spire. It is true; they certainly are so much.\\nBut it is false; they are so infinitely more. Democracy, like\\nany other polity, has been finely termed the memory of an\\nhistoric past, the consciousness of a living present, the ideal\\nof the coming future. Democracy, in a word, is a social, that\\nis to say, an ethical conception, and upon its ethical°signifi-cance\\nsignificance is based its significance as governmental. Democracy\\nis a form of government only because it is a form of moral\\nand spiritual association.\\nBut so ^is aristocracy. What is the difference? What\\ndistinguishes the ethical basis and ideal of one from that of\\nthe other? It may appear a roundabout way to reach a simple\\nend, to refer to Plato and to Greek life to get data for an\\nanswer; but I know of no way in which I can so easily bring\\nout what seems to me the truth. The Platonic Republic is a\\n\\n ― 241 ―\\n                            \\nsplendid and imperishable formulation of the aristocratic\\nideal. If it had no value for philosophical reasons, if its\\ntheory of morals, of reality and of knowledge had°disap-peared\\ndisappeared as utterly as the breezes which swept the grasses\\nunder the plane tree by which Plato and his disciples sat and\\ntalked, the Republic would be immortal as the summary of\\nall that was best and most permanent in Greek life, of its\\nways of thinking and feeling, and of its ideals. But the\\nRepublic is more; it seizes upon the heart of the ethical\\nproblem, the relation of the individual to the universal, and\\nstates a solution. The question of the Republic is as to the\\nideal of men\\'s conduct; the answer is such a development of\\nman\\'s nature as brings him into complete harmony with the\\nuniverse of spiritual relations, or, in Platonic language, the\\nstate. This universe, in turn, is man writ large; it is the\\nmanifestation, the realization of the capacities of the°individ-ual\\nindividual. Such a development of the individual that he shall be in\\nharmony with all others in the state, that is, that he shall\\npossess as his own the unified will of the community; that is\\nthe end both of politics and of ethics. Nothing could be more\\naside from the mark than to say that the Platonic ideal\\nsubordinates and sacrifices the individual to the state. It\\ndoes, indeed, hold that the individual can be what he ought\\nto be, can become what, in idea, he is, only as a member of a\\nspiritual organism, called by Plato the state, and, in losing\\nhis own individual will, acquiring that of this larger reality.\\nBut this is not loss of selfhood or personality, it is its\\nrealization. The individual is not sacrificed; he is brought to\\nreality in the state.\\nWe certainly cannot find here any ground upon which\\nto distinguish the aristocratic from the democratic ideal. But\\nwe have not asked how this unity of the individual and the\\nuniverse, this perfect man in the perfect state, is to be\\nbrought about. Here lies the distinction sought for; it is not a\\nquestion of end, but of means. According to Plato (and the\\naristocratic idea everywhere), the multitude is incapable of\\nforming such an ideal and of attempting to reach it. Plato is\\nthe true author of the doctrine of the \"remnant.\" There is,\\nin his words, \"no chance of perfection either in states or in\\nindividuals until a necessity is laid upon the small class of\\n\\n ― 242 ―\\n                            \\ncaring for the state.\" It is to the one wise man, or to the few,\\nthat Plato looks for redemption. Once found these are to be\\ngiven absolute control, and are to see to it that each°individ-ual\\nindividual is placed in such a position in the state that he may make\\nperfect harmony with the others, and at the same time\\nperform that for which he is best fitted, and thus realize the\\ngoal of life—\"Justice,\" in Plato\\'s word.\\nSuch is the barest outline of the most perfect picture of\\nthe aristocratic ideal which history affords. The few best,\\nthe aristoi; these know and are fitted for rule; but they are to\\nrule not in their own interests but in that of society as a\\nwhole, and, therefore, in that of every individual in society.\\nThey do not bear rule over the others; they show them what\\nthey can best do, and guide them in doing it. There is no\\nneed to dwell upon the charm, upon the attractiveness of the\\naristocratic ideal. The best witness to it is in the long line of\\ngreat men who have reiterated with increasing emphasis\\nthat all will go wrong, until the few who know and are\\nstrong, are put in power, while others, foregoing the°asser-tion\\nassertion of their individuality, submit to superior wisdom and\\ngoodness.\\nBut history has been making the other way. If history\\nbe, as Strauss said, a sound aristocrat, then history is°com-mitting\\ncommitting suicide. It is working towards something which is\\nnot history. The aristocratic ideal, spite of all its attractions,\\nis not equal to reality; it is not equal to the actual forces\\nanimating men as they work in history. It has failed because\\nit is found that the practical consequence of giving the few\\nwise and good power is that they cease to remain wise and\\ngood. They become ignorant of the needs and requirement\\nof the many; they leave the many outside the pale with no\\nreal share in the commonwealth. Perchance they even°wil-fully\\nwilfully use their wisdom and strength for themselves, for the\\nassertion of privilege and status and to the detriment of the\\ncommon good. The aristocratic society always limits the\\nrange of men who are regarded as participating in the state,\\nin the unity of purpose and destiny; and it always neglects to\\nsee that those theoretically included really obtain their well\\nbeing. Every forward democratic movement is followed by\\nthe broadening of the circle of the state, and by more°effec-tive\\n ― 243 ―\\n                            \\neffective oversight that every citizen may be insured the rights\\nbelonging to him.\\nBut even were it possible to find men so wise as not to\\nignore the misery and degradation beyond their immediate\\nken, men so good as to use their power only for the°commu-nity\\ncommunity, there is another fact which is the condemnation of the\\naristocratic theory. The ethical ideal is not satisfied merely\\nwhen all men sound the note of harmony with the highest\\nsocial good, so be it that they have not worked it out for\\nthemselves. Were it granted that the rule of the aristoi\\nwould lead to the highest external development of society\\nand the individual, there would still be a fatal objection.\\nHumanity cannot be content with a good which is procured\\nfrom without, however high and otherwise complete that\\ngood. The aristocratic idea implies that the mass of men are\\nto be inserted by wisdom, or, if necessary, thrust by force,\\ninto their proper positions in the social organism. It is true,\\nindeed, that when an individual has found that place in\\nsociety for which he is best fitted and is exercising the\\nfunction proper to that place, he has obtained his completest\\ndevelopment, but it is also true (and this is the truth omitted\\nby aristocracy, emphasized by democracy) that he must find\\nthis place and assume this work in the main for himself.\\nDemocracy does not differ from aristocracy in its goal. The\\nend is not mere assertion of the individual will as individual;\\nit is not disregard of law, of the universal; it is complete\\nrealization of the law, namely of the unified spirit of the\\ncommunity. Democracy differs as to its means. This°univer-sal\\nuniversal, this law, this unity of purpose, this fulfilling of function\\nin devotion to the interests of the social organism, is not to be\\nput into a man from without. It must begin in the man\\nhimself, however much the good and the wise of society\\ncontribute. Personal responsibility, individual initiation,\\nthese are the notes of democracy. Aristocracy and°democ-racy\\ndemocracy both imply that the actual state of society exists for the\\nsake of realizing an end which is ethical, but aristocracy\\nimplies that this is to be done primarily by means of special\\ninstitutions or organizations within society, while democracy\\nholds that the ideal is already at work in every personality,\\nand must be trusted to care for itself. There is an individual\\n\\n ― 244 ―\\n                            \\nism in democracy which there is not in aristocracy; but it is\\nan ethical, not a numerical individualism; it is an°individual-ism\\nindividualism of freedom, of responsibility, of initiative to and for the\\nethical ideal, not an individualism of lawlessness. In one\\nword, democracy means that personality is the first and final\\nreality. It admits that the full significance of personality can\\nbe learned by the individual only as it is already presented to\\nhim in objective form in society; it admits that the chief\\nstimuli and encouragements to the realization of personality\\ncome from society; but it holds, none the less, to the fact that\\npersonality cannot be procured for any one, however°de-graded\\ndegraded and feeble, by any one else, however wise and\\nstrong. It holds that the spirit of personality indwells in\\nevery individual and that the choice to develop it must\\nproceed from that individual. From this central position of\\npersonality result the other notes of democracy, liberty,\\nequality, fraternity,—words which are not mere words to\\ncatch the mob, but symbols of the highest ethical idea which\\nhumanity has yet reached—the idea that personality is the\\none thing of permanent and abiding worth, and that in every\\nhuman individual there lies personality.\\nBy way of illustration (and what is said in the°remain-der\\nremainder of this paper is only by way of illustration), let us take\\nthe notion of liberty. Plato gives a vivid illustration of what\\nhe means by democratic freedom. It is doing as one likes. It\\nis ordering life as one pleases. It is thinking and acting as\\none has a mind to. Liberty in a democracy can have no limit.\\nIts result is loss of reverence and of order. It is the denial of\\nmoderation, of the principle of limit. Democratic liberty is\\nthe following out of individual wills, of particular desires, to\\nthe utmost degree. It has no order or law (Republic viii.\\n557-563). In a word, it is the extreme assertion of°individu-alism\\nindividualism, resulting in anarchy. In this conception of liberty he\\nhas been followed by all of the anti-democratic school. But\\nfrom the democratic standpoint, it must be remembered that\\nthe individual is something more than the individual,\\nnamely, a personality. His freedom is not mere°self-asser-tion\\nself-assertion, nor unregulated desire. You cannot say that he knows\\nno law; you must say that he knows no law but his own, the\\nlaw of personality; no law, in other words, externally°im-posed\\n ― 245 ―\\n                            \\nimposed, however splendid the authority, and undoubted the\\ngoodness of those that impose it. Law is the objective°ex-pression\\nexpression of personality. It is not a limitation upon individual\\nfreedom; it is correlative with it. Liberty is not a numerical\\nnotion of isolation; it is the ethical idea that personality is the\\nsupreme and only law, that every man is an absolute end in\\nhimself. The democratic ideal includes liberty, because°de-mocracy\\ndemocracy without initiation from within, without an ideal\\nchosen from within and freely followed from within, is°noth-ing\\nnothing.\\nAgain, for illustration, take the notion of equality. If\\nwe heed the aristocratic school, we learn that equality means\\nnumerical equality, that one number one is just as good as\\nany other number one. Conceiving it to refer to bald°individ-uality\\nindividuality, they think its inevitable outcome, logical if not°histor-ical\\nhistorical, is an equal division of all things from virtue to wealth.\\nDemocracy is condemned because it regards as equal the\\nworst and the best of men, the wisest and the most ignorant.\\nIt is condemned because it is said to aim at an equal°distribu-tion\\ndistribution of wealth and of the happiness that grows from material\\npossessions and surroundings. It is said that it is both foolish\\nand wicked to attempt by the lie of equality to blind one\\'s\\neyes to the differences of men in wisdom, virtue, and°indus-try\\nindustry; that upon these differences, indeed, rests the whole\\nstructure of society with its necessary grades of°subordina-tion\\nsubordination and service; and that the only society which is either\\nstable or progressive is one in which the motives of°inequal-ity\\ninequality, both political and industrial, have fair play. As Maine\\nsays, the motives which have always impelled mankind to\\nthe production of increasing industrial resources are such as\\ninfallibly entail inequality in its distribution. It is the never-\\nending struggle for existence, the private war which makes\\none man strive to climb upon the shoulders of another and\\nstay there, which have been the springs to action. Take them\\naway, introduce equality, and you have no motive to°prog-ress\\nprogress.\\nWhat shall we say to this indictment? Simply that it is\\nbeside the mark. As relates to democracy, it corresponds to\\nno reality. Equality is not an arithmetical, but an ethical\\nconception. Personality is as universal as humanity; it is\\n\\n ― 246 ―\\n                            \\nindifferent to all distinctions which divide men from men.\\nWherever you have a man, there you have personality, and\\nthere is no trace by which one personality may be°distin-guished\\ndistinguished from another so as to be set above or below. It\\nmeans that in every individual there lives an infinite and\\nuniversal possibility; that of being a king and priest.°Aris-tocracy\\nAristocracy is blasphemy against personality. It is the doctrine\\nof the elect few applied not to some life in the future, but to\\nall relations of humanity. Hero-worship means man°de-spised\\ndespised. The true meaning of equality is synonymous with\\nthe definition of democracy given by James Russell Lowell.\\nIt is the form of society in which every man has a chance\\nand knows that he has it—and we may add, a chance to\\nwhich no possible limits can be put, a chance which is truly\\ninfinite, the chance to become a person. Equality, in short, is\\nthe ideal of humanity; an ideal in the consciousness of which\\ndemocracy lives and moves.\\nOne aspect of the indictment remains to be touched—\\nthe nature of industrial equality, or the supposed tendency of\\ndemocracy towards socialism, if not communism. And there\\nis no need to beat about the bush in saying that democracy is\\nnot in reality what it is in name until it is industrial, as well\\nas civil and political. Such a condition is indeed far enough\\naway; on this point, democracy is an ideal of the future, not\\na starting point. In this respect, society is still a sound\\naristocrat. And the reflex influence of this upon our civil and\\npolitical organization is such that they are only imperfectly\\ndemocratic. For their sakes, therefore, as well as for that of\\nindustrial relations, a democracy of wealth is a necessity.\\nAll that makes such assertions seem objectionable is\\nthat this democracy of wealth is represented, often by its\\nadherents, always by its opponents, as if it meant the°numeri-cal\\nnumerical division into equal portions of all wealth, and its°numeri-cal\\nnumerical redistribution. But all that has been said in this paper\\nhas been said in vain, unless it be now recognized that\\ndemocracy is anything but a numerical notion; and that the\\nnumerical application of it is as much out of place here as it\\nis everywhere else. What is meant in detail by a democracy\\nof wealth we shall not know until it is more of a reality than\\nit is now. In general, however, it means and must mean that\\n\\n ― 247 ―\\n                            \\nall industrial relations are to be regarded as subordinate to\\nhuman relations, to the law of personality. Numerical°iden-tity\\nidentity is not required, it is not even allowed; but it is absolutely\\nrequired that industrial organization shall be made a social\\nfunction. And if this expression again seems objectionable, it\\nis because it is interpreted to mean that in some way society,\\nas a whole, to the abolition of all individual initiative and\\nresult, is to take charge of all those undertakings which we\\ncall economic. It seems to imply socialism in the sense in\\nwhich that mode of life destroys that individual°responsibil-ity\\nresponsibility and activity which are at the very heart of modern life.\\nBut when we are told that the family is a social institution,\\nand that life in the family is a social function, do we°under-stand\\nunderstand this to mean that it is a form of existence in which\\nall individuality is renounced, and an artificial entity created\\nwhich absorbs the rightful activities of the individual? I\\nthink not; we mean that the family is an ethical community,\\nand that life in the family conforms to its idea only when the\\nindividual realizes oneness of interest and purpose with it.\\nAnd this, in kind, is precisely what is meant when we\\nspeak of industrial relations as being necessarily social; we\\nmean that they are to become the material of an ethical\\nrealization; the form and substance of a community of good\\n(though not necessarily of goods) wider than any now\\nknown: that as the family, largely in its best examples, the\\nstate somewhat, though in a less degree, mean unity of\\npurpose and interest, so economic society must mean unity\\nof interest and purpose. The truth is that in these matters we\\nare still largely in the intellectual bounds which bound pre-\\nChristian thought. We still think of life as having two parts,\\none animal, the other truly human and therefore truly°ethi-cal\\nethical. The getting and distributing of the material benefits of\\nlife are regarded as indeed a means to the possibility of the\\nhigher life, the life of men in their distinctively human\\nrelations, but as in themselves wholly outside of that life.\\nBoth Plato and Aristotle, for example, always take it as a\\nmatter of course, that everything which is industrial, which\\nconcerns the getting or distributing of wealth, lies wholly\\noutside, nay, is opposed to the life of the citizen, that is, of\\nthe member of an ethical community. Plato\\'s attacks upon\\n\\n ― 248 ―\\n                            \\nthe Sophists for receiving money for teaching were on the\\nground that they thus degraded a personal (that is, a moral)\\nrelation, that of teacher and pupil, to an industrial; as if the\\ntwo were necessarily hostile. Aristotle denies that an artisan\\ncan have virtue, i.e., the qualities pertaining to the°fulfill-ment\\nfulfillment of social functions. Mechanics are, indeed,°indispensa-ble\\nindispensable to the state, \"but not all who are indispensable to the\\nstate are citizens.\" (And we must remember that the terms\\n\"citizen\" and \"state\" have, in Aristotle, always an ethical\\nbearing.) It was necessary that there should be some who\\nshould give themselves to that which is purely material, the\\nindustrial, in order that others might have the leisure to give\\nthemselves to the social and political, the ethical. We have,\\nnominally, at least, given up the idea that a certain body of\\nmen are to be set aside for the doing of this necessary work;\\nbut we still think of this work, and of the relations°pertain-ing\\npertaining to it, as if they were outside of the ethical realm and\\nwholly in the natural. We admit, nay, at times we claim,\\nthat ethical rules are to be applied to this industrial sphere,\\nbut we think of it as an external application. That the\\neconomic and industrial life is in itself ethical, that it is to be\\nmade contributory to the realization of personality through\\nthe formation of a higher and more complete unity among\\nmen, this is what we do not recognize; but such is the\\nmeaning of the statement that democracy must become°in-dustrial\\nindustrial.\\nI have used these illustrations simply for the sake of\\nshowing what I understand the conception of democracy to\\nmean, and to show that the ordinary objections to democracy\\nrest upon ideas which conceive of it after the type of an\\nindividualism of a numerical character; and have tried to\\nsuggest that democracy is an ethical idea, the idea of a\\npersonality, with truly infinite capacities, incorporate with\\nevery man. Democracy and the one, the ultimate, ethical\\nideal of humanity are to my mind synonyms. The idea of\\ndemocracy, the ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity,\\nrepresent a society in which the distinction between the\\nspiritual and the secular has ceased, and as in Greek theory,\\nas in the Christian theory of the Kingdom of God, the\\nchurch and the state, the divine and the human organization\\n\\n ― 249 ―\\n                            \\nof society are one. But this, you will say, is idealism. In\\nreply, I can but quote James Russell Lowell once more and\\nsay that \"it is indeed idealism, but that I am one of those\\nwho believe that the real will never find an irremovable basis\\ntill it rests upon the ideal\"; and add that the best test of any\\nform of society is the ideal which it proposes for the forms of\\nits life, and the degree in which it realizes this ideal.\\n\\n ― 250 ―\\n                            \\n ― 251 ―\\n                            \\n')"

      "the time of Leibniz has been such as to render almost self-\n",

      "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in Leipzig, June\n",
      "21, 1646. His father, who died when Leibniz was only six\n",
      "years old, was a professor in the university and a notary of\n",
      "considerable practice. From him the future philosopher\n",
      "seems to have derived his extraordinary industry and love of\n",
      "detail. Such accounts as we have of him show no traces of\n",
      "the wonderful intellectual genius of his son, but only a\n",
      "diligent, plodding, faithful, and religious man, a thoroughly\n",
      "conscientious husband, jurist, and professor. Nor in the lines\n",
      "of physical heredity can we account for the unique career of\n",
      "Leibniz by his mother's endowments. The fact, however,\n",
      "that she was patient in all trial, living in peace with her\n",
      "neighbors, anxious for unity and concord with all people,\n",
      "even with those not well disposed to her, throws great light\n",
      "upon the fundamental trait of Leibniz's ethical nature. As in\n",
      "so many cases, it is the inherited moral characteristics which\n",
      "form the basis of the intellectual nature. The love of unity\n",
      "which was a moral trait in Leibniz's mother became in him\n",
      "the hunger for a harmonious and unified mental world; the\n",
      "father's devotion to detail showed itself as the desire for\n",
      "knowledge as minute and comprehensive as it was°inter-re-lated\n",
      "inter-related.\n",

      "never ceased to count this one of the greatest fortunes of his\n",
      "life. Writing in after years to a friend, he says:—\n",
      "\"When I lost my father, and was left without any\n",
      "direction in my studies, I had the luck to get at books in all\n",
      "languages, of all religions, upon all sciences, and to read\n",
      "them without any regular order, just as my own impulse led\n",
      "me. From this I obtained the great advantage that I was\n",
      "freed from ordinary prejudices, and introduced to many\n",
      "things of which I should otherwise never have thought.\"\n",
      "In a philosophical essay, in which he describes himself\n",
      "under the name of Guilielmus Pacidius, he says:—\n",
      "\"Wilhelm Friedlieb, a German by birth, who lost his\n",
      "father in his early years, was led to study through the innate\n",
      "tendency of his spirit; and the freedom with which he moved\n",
      "about in the sciences was equal to this innate impulse. He\n",
      "buried himself, a boy eight years old, in a library, staying\n",
      "there sometimes whole days, and, hardly stammering Latin,\n",
      "he took up every book which pleased his eyes. Opening and\n",
      "shutting them without any choice, he sipped now here, now\n",
      "there, lost himself in one, skipped over another, as the\n",
      "clearness of expression or of content attracted him. He\n",
      "seemed to be directed by the Tolle et lege of a higher voice.\n",
      "As good fortune would have it, he gave himself up to the\n",
      "ancients, in whom he at first understood nothing, by degrees\n",
      "a little, finally all that was really necessary, until he assumed\n",
      "not only a certain coloring of their expression, but also of\n",
      "their thought,—just as those who go about in the sun, even\n",
      "while they are occupied with other things, get sun-\n",
      "browned.\"\n",
      "And he goes on to tell us that their influence always\n",
      "remained with him. Their human, their important, their\n",
      "comprehensive ideas, grasping the whole of life in one\n",
      "image, together with their clear, natural, and transparent\n",
      "mode of expression, adapted precisely to their thoughts,\n",
      "seemed to him to be in the greatest contrast with the°writ-ings\n",
      "writings of moderns, without definiteness or order in expression,\n",
      "and without vitality or purpose in thought,—\"written as if\n",
      "for another world.\" Thus Leibniz learned two of the great\n",
      "lessons of his life,—to seek always for clearness of diction\n",
      "and for pertinence and purpose of ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      " ― 257 ―\n",
      "                            \n",
      "Historians and poets first occupied him; but when in\n",
      "his school-life, a lad of twelve or thirteen years, he came to\n",
      "the study of logic, he was greatly struck, he says, by the\n",
      "\"ordering and analysis of thoughts which he found there.\"\n",
      "He gave himself up to making tables of categories and\n",
      "predicaments, analyzing each book that he read into suitable\n",
      "topics, and arranging these into classes and sub-classes. We\n",
      "can imagine the astonishment of his playmates as he burst\n",
      "upon them with a demand to classify this or that idea, to find\n",
      "its appropriate predicament. Thus he was led naturally to\n",
      "the philosophic books in his father's library,—to Plato and to\n",
      "Aristotle, to the Scholastics. Suarez, in particular, among\n",
      "the latter, he read; and traces of his influences are to be\n",
      "found in the formulation of his own philosophic system. At\n",
      "about this same time he took great delight in the theological\n",
      "works with which his father's library abounded, reading\n",
      "with equal ease and pleasure the writings of the Lutherans\n",
      "and of the Reformed Church, of the Jesuits and the°Jansen-ists\n",
      "Jansenists, of the Thomists and the Arminians. The result was, he\n",
      "tells us, that he was strengthened in the Lutheran faith of\n",
      "his family, but, as we may easily imagine from his after life,\n",
      "made tolerant of all forms of faith.\n",
      "In 1661 the boy Leibniz, fifteen years old, entered the\n",
      "University of Leipzig. If we glance back upon his°attain-ments\n",
      "attainments, we find him thoroughly at home in Latin, having\n",

      "contemporary range of science, except in mathematics and physics,\n",
      "deeply read and interested in ancient and scholastic°philoso-phy\n",

      "though I did not as yet thoroughly understand the old. I thus\n",
      "gained two things: I did not fill my mind with things empty\n",
      "and to be unlearned afterwards,—things resting upon the\n",
      "assertion of the teacher, and not upon reason; and secondly,\n",
      "I never rested till I got down to the very roots of the science\n",

      "on is testimony to the fact that even at this age the idea of\n",
      "self-development, of individual growth from within, was\n",
      "working upon him. In the fact, also, that he was self-taught\n",
      "we find doubtless the reason that he alone of the thinkers of\n",
      "this period did not have to retrace his steps, to take a hostile\n",
      "attitude towards the ideas into which he was educated, and\n",
      "to start anew upon a foundation then first built. The°devel-opment\n",
      "development of the thought of Leibniz is so gradual, continuous,\n",

      "result of his fundamental principles. If we recall what has\n",
      "been said concerning the monad, we shall remember that it\n",
      "is an activity, but an activity with a content. It is a force, but\n",
      "a force which mirrors the universe. The content, that°por-tion\n",
      "portion of reality which is reflected in the action, is knowledge,\n",
      "or the idea; the activity which brings this about is will, or\n",

      "content. There is, strictly speaking, no \"state\" of mind;\n",
      "there is only a tension, a pushing forward of mind. There is\n",
      "no idea which is not a volition. Will is thus used, in a very\n",

      "We have seen, however, that there are various stages\n",
      "in the reflecting power of the soul, or in the realization of\n",

      "perception and apperception; that is, there are the conscious and\n",
      "the unconscious mirroring of reality. We shall expect, then,\n",
      "to find two corresponding stages of volition. Leibniz calls\n",
      "these stages \"appetition\" and \"volition\" in the narrower\n",
      "sense. The constant tendency in every monad to go from one\n",
      "perception to another,—that is, the following of the law of\n",
      "development,—constitutes appetition. If joined to feeling, it\n",
      "constitutes instinct. Since, again, there are two degrees of\n",
      "apperception, one of empirical, the other of rational,°con-sciousness\n",
      "consciousness, we shall expect to find two grades of volition\n",

      "expand and illustrate these various propositions.\n",
      "Sensations, looked at not as to what they represent, but\n",
      "in themselves, are impulses. As such they constitute the\n",
      "lowest stage of will. Impulsive action then includes all such\n",
      "as occurs for an end which is unknown, or at best but dimly\n",
      "felt. Such action may be called blind, not in the sense that it\n",
      "is without reason, but in the sense that reason is not°con-sciously\n",
      "consciously present. We are not to think of this instinctive\n",
      "action, however, as if it were found simply in the animals.\n",
      "Much of human action is also impulsive; probably, indeed,\n",
      "an impulsive factor is contained in our most rational willing.\n",

      "is unmotivated, and hence come to believe in \"indifferent\n",
      "freedom,\"—the ability to choose as we will.\n",
      "We shall shortly take up in more detail the theory of\n",
      "Leibniz regarding the freedom of will; and it is needful here\n",
      "to remark only that the conception which makes it consist in\n",

      "of the strongest argument for indifferent choice,—that\n",
      "drawn from the immediate \"testimony\" of consciousness.\n",
      "Upon the origin and nature of desires Leibniz has\n",
      "much more to say than about the impulses. His account of\n",
      "the transition from impulse to desire is based upon the\n",
      "conception of unconscious ideas. Slight and imperceptible\n",
      "impulses are working upon us all the time. Indeed, they are\n",
      "a necessity; for the actual state of a soul or monad at any\n",
      "time is, of course, one of incompleteness. Our nature must\n",
      "always work to free itself from its hindrances and obtain its\n",
      "goal of complete development. But it will not do this unless\n",
      "there is some stimulus, some solicitation to induce it to\n",
      "overcome its limitation. There is found accordingly in our\n",
      "every condition a feeling of dissatisfaction, or, using Locke's\n",
      "word, of \"uneasiness\"; and it is this which calls forth that\n",
      "activity which brings about a nearer approach to the soul's\n",
      "real good. But Leibniz differs from Locke in saying that this\n",
      "feeling of uneasiness is not a distinct, or even in most cases a\n",
      "conscious, one. It is not pain, although it differs from pain\n",
      "only in degree. Uneasiness and pain are related to each other\n",
      "as appetite for food is to hunger,—the first suffices to°stimu-late\n",

      "satisfactions results in pleasure. In Leibniz's own words:—\n",
      "\"If these elements of pain were themselves true pains,\n",
      "we should always be in a state of misery, even in pursuing\n",
      "the good. But since there is always going on a summation of\n",
      "minute successes in overcoming these states of uneasiness,\n",
      "and these put us more and more at ease, there comes about a\n",
      "decided pleasure, which often has greater value even than\n",
      "the enjoyment of the good. Far, then, from regarding this\n",
      "uneasiness as a thing incompatible with happiness, I find\n",
      "that it is an essential condition of our happiness. For this\n",
      "does not consist in perfect possession, which would make us\n",
      "insensible and stupid, but in a constant progress towards\n",
      "greater results, which must always be accompanied,°accord-ingly\n",
      "accordingly, by this element of desire or uneasiness.\"\n",
      "And again he says that \"we enjoy all the advantages of\n",
      "pain without any of its inconveniences. If the uneasiness\n",
      "should become too distinct, we should be miserable in our\n",
      "awaiting the good which relieves it; but as it is, there is a\n",
      "constant victory over these half-pains, which we always find\n",
      "in desire, and this gives us a quantity of half-pleasures,\n",
      "whose continuance and summation (for they acquire force\n",
      "like a moving body as it falls) result in a whole and true\n",
      "pleasure.\" In short, there is indeed an element of pain in all\n",
      "desire which stimulates us to action, and therefore to higher\n",
      "development. But ordinarily this element of pain is not°pres-ent\n",
      "present as such in consciousness, but is absorbed in the pleasure\n",
      "which accompanies the realization of the higher good. Thus\n",
      "Leibniz, accepting and emphasizing the very same fact that\n",
      "served Schopenhauer as a psychological base of pessimism,\n",
      "uses it as a foundation-stone of optimism.\n",
      "But desire, or the conscious tendency towards°some-thing\n",
      "something required as a good, accompanied by the dim feeling of\n",

      "complete will. But what governs the production of this°pre-vailing\n",
      "prevailing or dominant effort, which we may interpret as the act\n",
      "of choice? The answer is simple: the result of the conflict of\n",
      "these various factors, the striking of the balance, is the\n",
      "choice. Some desire emerges from the confused complex,\n",
      "and that desire is the final determination of the will. This\n",
      "desire may not in all cases be the strongest in itself,—that is,\n",
      "the one whose satisfaction will allay the greatest°\"uneasi-ness\n",
      "\"uneasiness,\" for the others, taken together, may outweigh it; it\n",
      "may, so to speak, have a plurality, but not a majority, of\n",
      "volitional forces on its side,—and in this case a fusion of\n",
      "opposing factors may defeat it. But in any event the result\n",
      "will be the algebraic sum of the various desires and°im-pulses\n",
      "impulses.\n",
      "It is not at all necessary, however, that the net outcome\n",
      "shall make itself apparent as a mechanical equivalent of the\n",
      "forces at work. The soul, Leibniz says, may use its skill in\n",
      "the formation of parties, so as to make this or that side the\n",
      "victor. How is this to be done, and still disallow the°possibil-ity\n",
      "possibility of arbitrary choice? This problem is solved through\n",
      "action becoming deliberate. Deliberate action is impossible\n",
      "unless the soul has formed the habit of looking ahead and of\n",
      "arranging for modes of action which do not present°them-selves\n",
      "themselves as immediate necessities. Only in this way can one\n",
      "look at the matter impartially and coolly; \"at the moment of\n",

      "is the secret of translating impulsive action into the°deliber-ate\n",
      "deliberate sphere.\n",
      "Of these habits the simplest consists in thinking only\n",

      "thought of the ignoble origin of a desire or of its repulsive,\n",
      "though remote, result will bring into action desires of an\n",

      "however, it had any direct influence over desires, but by its\n",
      "ability of bringing other desires into the field. The will, in\n",
      "short, is not opposed to desire, though rational desire may be\n",

      "completes it.\" In short, the term \"monad\" is equivalent to\n",
      "the term \"entelechy\" only when applied to God. In every\n",
      "other monad, the entelechy, or energy, is but one factor.\n",
      "\"Matter, or primitive passive power, completes the°entele-chy\n",
      "entelechy, or primitive active power, so that it becomes a perfect\n",

      "Aristotle, gives the name, \"first\" or \"bare\" matter. The\n",
      "same influence is seen in the fact that he opposes this°ele-ment\n",

      "without, so far as it receives impressions from the universe.\n",
      "Yet we have learned to know that in one sense everything\n",
      "occurs from the spontaneity of the monad itself; it receives\n",
      "no influence or influxus from without; everything comes\n",
      "from its own depths, or is appetition. But, on the other hand,\n",
      "all that which so comes forth is only a mirroring or copying\n",
      "of the universe. The whole content of the appetition is°repre-sentation\n",
      "representation. Although the monad works spontaneously, it is\n",
      "none the less determined in its activities to produce only\n",
      "reflections or images of the world. In this way appetition and\n",
      "representation appear to be identical. The monad is°deter-mined\n",
      "determined from within, indeed, but it is determined to exactly\n",
      "the same results as if wholly determined from without.\n",
      "What light, then, can be thrown from this distinction upon\n",
      "the nature of matter?\n",
      "None, unless we follow Leibniz somewhat farther. If\n",
      "we do, we shall see that the soul is regarded as appetitive, or\n",
      "self-active, so far as it has clear and distinct ideas. If the\n",
      "monad reaches distinct consciousness, it has knowledge of\n",
      "self,—that is, of the nature of pure spirit,—or, what again is\n",
      "equivalent to this, of the nature of reality as it universally is.\n",
      "Such knowledge is knowledge of God, of substance, of\n",
      "unity, of pure activity, and of all the innate ideas which\n",
      "elevate the confused perceptions of sense into science.°Dis-tinct\n",
      "Distinct consciousness is therefore equivalent to self-activity,\n",
      "and this to recognition of God and the universal. But if\n",
      "knowledge is confused, it is not possible to see it in its\n",
      "relations to self; it cannot be analyzed; the rational or ideal\n",
      "element in it is concealed from view. In confused ideas,\n",
      "therefore, the soul appears to be passive; being passive, to be\n",
      "determined from without. This determination from without\n",
      "is equivalent to that which is opposed to spirit or reason, and\n",
      "hence appears as matter. Such is in outline the Leibnizian\n",

      "which, through its dependent relation upon God, the°abso-lute\n",

      "contradiction; and all these 'infinites' and 'infinitesimals' are\n",
      "of use only in geometry, as imaginary roots are in algebra.\"\n",
      "That which is ordinarily called the infinite, that is, the\n",
      "quantitative infinite, is in reality only the indefinite. \"We\n",
      "involve ourselves in difficulty when we talk about a series of\n",

      "is not clothed with magnitude, nor does it consist in number.\n",
      ". . . The Absolute alone, the indivisible infinite, has true\n",
      "unity,—I mean God.\" And as he sums up the matter: \"The\n",
      "infinite, consisting of parts, is neither one nor a whole; it\n",

      "not a whole [of parts]: this infinite is God.\"\n",

      "correct account of the origin of the notion of the quantitative\n",
      "infinite, or-to speak philosophically, and not after the use of\n",
      "terms convenient in mathematics—the indefinite. According\n",
      "to him, its origin is the mere empirical repeating of a°sen-suous\n",
      "sensuous datum of time and space. According to Leibniz, this\n",
      "repetition, however long continued, can give no idea beyond\n",
      "itself; it can never generate the idea that the process of\n",
      "repetition may be continued without a limit. Here, as°else-where\n",

      "                            \n",
      "elsewhere, he objects that experience cannot guarantee notions\n",
      "beyond the limits of experience. Locke's process of°repeti-tion\n",
      "repetition could tell us that a number had been extended up to a\n",
      "given point; not that it could be extended without limit. The\n",
      "source of this latter idea must be found, therefore, where we\n",
      "find the origin of all extra-empirical notions,—in reason. \"Its\n",
      "origin is the same as that of universal and necessary truths.\"\n",
      "It is not the empirical process of multiplying, but the fact\n",
      "that the same reason for multiplying always exists, that\n",
      "originates and guarantees the idea. \"Take a straight line\n",
      "and prolong it in such a way that it is double the first. It is\n",
      "evident that the second, being perfectly similar to the first,\n",
      "can be itself doubled; and we have a third, which in turn is\n",
      "similar to the preceding. The same reason always being\n",
      "present, it is not possible that the process should ever be\n",
      "brought to a stop. Thus the line can be prolonged 'to°infin-ity\n",
      "infinity.' Therefore the idea of 'infinity' comes from the°consider-ation\n",

      "The considerations which we have grouped together in\n",
      "this chapter serve to show the fundamental philosophical\n",
      "difference between Locke and Leibniz. Although, taken in\n",
      "detail, they are self-explanatory, a few words may be°permit-ted\n",
      "permitted upon their unity and ultimate bearing. It is characteristic\n",
      "of Locke that he uses the same principle of explanation with\n",
      "reference to the conceptions of substance, identity and°diver-sity\n",
      "diversity, and infinity, and that this principle is that of spatial and\n",
      "temporal relation. Infinity is conceived as quantitative, as\n",
      "the successive addition of times and spaces; identity and\n",
      "diversity are oneness and difference of existence as°deter-mined\n",
      "determined by space and time; substance is the underlying static\n",
      "substratum of qualities, and, as such, is considered after the\n",
      "analogy of things existing in space and through time. It\n",
      "must not be forgotten that Locke believed as thoroughly as\n",
      "Leibniz in the substantial existence of the world, of the\n",
      "human soul, and of God; in the objective continuity of the\n",
      "world, and the personal identity of man, and in the true\n",
      "infinity of God. Whatever negative or sceptical inferences\n",
      "may have afterwards been drawn from Locke's premises\n",

      "they lose their meaning and their validity. According to him\n",

      "diversity (as must be done if it be thought after the manner of\n",

      "indeed, afterwards showed. Substance, which is merely a\n",

      "unverifiable. While, then, the aim of both Locke and Leibniz as\n",
      "regards these categories was the same, Leibniz saw what\n",
      "Locke did not,—that to interpret them after the manner of\n",
      "existence in space and time, to regard them (in Leibniz's\n",

      "to defeat that aim. The sole way to justify them, and in\n",
      "justifying them to give relative validity to the sensible and\n",

      "we would know anything further concerning a substance,\n",

      "We may with advantage connect this discussion with\n",
      "the fundamental doctrine of Locke and Leibniz regarding\n",
      "intelligence and reality. To Locke, as we have seen,°knowl-edge\n",
      "knowledge is essentially a matter of relations or connections; but\n",
      "relations are \"superinduced\" and \"extraneous\" as regards\n",
      "the facts. Every act of knowledge constitutes, therefore, in\n",
      "some way a departure from the reality to be known.°Knowl-edge\n",
      "Knowledge and fact are, by their very definition, opposed to one\n",
      "another. But in Leibniz's view intelligence, or reason, enters\n",
      "into the constitution of reality; indeed, it is reality. The\n",
      "relations which are the \"creatures of the understanding\"\n",
      "are, therefore, not foreign to the material to be known, but\n",
      "are organic to it, forming its content. The process, then, in\n",
      "which the mind perceives the connections or relations of\n",
      "ideas or objects, is simply the process by which the mind\n",

      "                            \n",
      "comes to the consciousness of the real nature of these°ob-jects\n",
      "objects, not a process of \"superinducing\" unreal ideas upon\n",
      "them. The difficulty of Locke is the difficulty of every theory\n",
      "of knowledge that does not admit an organic unity of the\n",
      "knowing mind and the known universe. The theory is\n",
      "obliged to admit that all knowledge is in the form of°rela-tions\n",
      "relations which have their source in intelligence. But being tied\n",
      "to the view that reality is distinct from intelligence, it is\n",
      "obliged to draw the conclusion that these relations are not to\n",
      "be found in actual existence, and hence that all knowledge,\n",
      "whatever else it may be, is unreal in the sense that it does\n",
      "not and cannot conform to actual fact. But, in the theory of\n",
      "Leibniz, the process of relating which is the essence of\n",
      "knowledge is only the realization on the part of the°individ-ual\n",
      "individual mind of the relations or reasons that eternally constitute\n",
      "reality. Since reality is, and is what it is, through°intelli-gence\n",
      "intelligence, whatever relations intelligence rightly perceives are\n",
      "not \"extraneous\" to reality, but are its \"essence.\" As°Leib-niz\n",
      "Leibniz says, \"Truth consists in the relations between the objects\n",
      "of our ideas. This does not depend upon language, but is\n",
      "common to us with God, so that when God manifests a truth\n",
      "to us, we acquire what is already in his understanding. For\n",
      "although there is an infinite difference between his ideas and\n",
      "ours as to their perfection and extent, yet it is always true\n",
      "that as to the same relation they are identical. And it is in\n",
      "this relation that truth exists.\" To this may be added°an-other\n",
      "another statement, which throws still further light on this\n",

      "perceive them.\"\n",
      "We have now to consider somewhat more in detail the\n",
      "means by which the transformation of empirical into°ra-tional\n",
      "rational knowledge is carried on. Leibniz points out that the\n",
      "difficulty concerning scientific knowledge of sensible facts is\n",
      "not lack of data, but, in a certain sense, superfluity of data.\n",
      "It is not that we perceive no connections among objects, but\n",
      "that we perceive many which we cannot reduce to one\n",
      "another. \"Our experiences,\" says Leibniz, \"are simple only\n",
      "in appearance, for they are always accompanied by°circum-stances\n",
      "circumstances connected with them, although these relations are\n",
      "not understood by us. These circumstances furnish material\n",

      "pleonasm in our perceptions of sensible objects and qualities,\n",
      "since we have more than one idea of the same object. Gold\n",
      "can be nominally defined in many ways. Such definitions are\n",
      "only provisional.\" This is to say, empirical knowledge will\n",
      "become rational when it is possible to view any subject-\n",
      "matter as a unity, instead of a multiplicity of varied aspects.\n",
      "And on this same subject he says, in another connection: \"A\n",
      "great number of experiences can furnish us data more than\n",
      "sufficient for scientific knowledge, provided only we have the\n",
      "art of using these data.\" The aim of science is therefore, to\n",
      "discover the dynamic unity which makes a whole of what\n",
      "appears to be a mere mass of accidentally connected°circum-stances\n",
      "circumstances. This unity of relations is the individual.\n",
      "It is thus evident that to Leibniz the individual is not\n",
      "the beginning of knowledge, but its goal. The individual is\n",
      "the organic, the dynamic unity of the variety of phases or\n",
      "notions presented us in sense-experience. Individuality is not\n",
      "\"simplicity\" in the sense of Locke; that is, separation from\n",
      "all relations. It is complete connection of all relations. \"It is\n",
      "impossible for us to have [complete] knowledge of°individu-als\n",
      "individuals, and to find the means of determining exactly the°individ-uality\n",
      "individuality of anything; for in individuality all circumstances are\n",
      "combined. Individuality envelops the infinite. Only so far as\n",
      "we know the infinite do we know the individual, on account\n",
      "of the influence (if this word be correctly understood) that\n",
      "all things in the universe exercise upon one another.\"°Leib-niz\n",
      "Leibniz, in short, remains true to his conception of the monad as\n",
      "the ultimate reality; for the monad, though an individual,\n",
      "yet has the universe as its content. We shall be able,°there-fore\n",
      "therefore, to render our sensible experiences rational just in the\n",
      "degree in which we can discover the underlying relations\n",
      "and dependencies which make them members of one°individ-ual\n",

      "For the process of transformation Leibniz relies°espe-cially\n",
      "especially upon two methods?—those of mathematics and of°clas-sification\n",
      "classification. Of the former he here says but little; but the entire\n",

      "truth of Leibniz's fundamental principles that he foresaw\n",
      "also the course which the development of biological science\n",
      "would take. No classification based upon resemblances, says\n",
      "Leibniz in effect, can be regarded as wholly arbitrary, since\n",
      "resemblances are found in nature also. The only question is\n",
      "whether our classification is based upon superficial or°funda-mental\n",
      "fundamental identities; the superficial resemblances being such as\n",
      "are external, or the effects of some common cause, while the\n",
      "fundamental resemblances are such as are the cause of°what-ever\n",
      "whatever other similarities are found. \"It can be said that°what-ever\n",
      "whatever we compare or distinguish with truth, nature°differen-tiates\n",
      "differentiates, or makes agree, also; but that nature has differences\n",
      "and identities which are better than ours, which we do not\n",
      "know. . . . The more we discover the generation of species,\n",
      "and the more we follow in our classifications the conditions\n",
      "that are required for their production, the nearer we°ap-proach\n",
      "approach the natural order.\" Our classifications, then, so far as\n",
      "they depend upon what is conditioned, are imperfect and\n",
      "provisional, although they cannot be said to be false (since\n",
      "\"while nature may give us those more complete and°conven-ient\n",
      "convenient, it will not give the lie to those we have already\"); while\n",
      "so far as they rest upon what is causal and conditioning,\n",
      "they are true, general, and necessary. In thus insisting that\n",
      "classification should be genetic, Leibniz anticipated the\n",
      "great service which the theory of evolution has done for\n",
      "biological science in enabling science to form classes which\n",
      "are \"natural\"; that is, based on identity of origin.\n",
      "Leibniz culminates his discussion of classification as a\n",
      "method of translating the empirical into the rational, by\n",
      "pointing out that it rests upon the law of continuity; and that\n",
      "this law contains two factors,—one equivalent to the axiom\n",
      "of the Realists, that nature is nowhere empty; the other, to\n",
      "that of the Nominalists, that nature does nothing uselessly.\n",
      "\"One of these principles seems to make nature a prodigal,\n",
      "the other a miser; and yet both are true if properly°under-stood\n",
      "understood,\" says Leibniz. \"Nature is like a good manager,°spar-ing\n",

      "magnificent in its effects, and economical in the causes used\n",
      "to produce them.\" In other words, classification becomes\n",
      "science when it presents us with both unity and difference.\n",
      "The principle of unity is that of nature as a miser and\n",
      "economical; that of differentiation is the principle of nature\n",
      "as prodigal and magnificent. The thoroughly differentiated\n",
      "unity is nature as self-specifying, or as an organic, not an\n",
      "abstract, unity.\n",
      "The gist of the whole matter is, then, that experience\n",
      "presents us with an infinity of ideas, which may appear at\n",
      "first sight arbitrary and accidental in their connections. This\n",
      "appearance, however, is not the fact. These ideas are the\n",

      "experiences to underlying unities, and these unities, like all real\n",
      "unities or simple beings, are spiritual and rational in nature.\n",
      "Leibniz's ordinary way of stating this is that the principle of\n",
      "truths of fact is that of sufficient reason. This principle\n",
      "Leibniz always treats as distinguished from that of identity\n",

      "the theology of Leibniz and indirectly to the completion of\n",
      "those ethical doctrines already outlined in the chapter on\n",
      "will. Leibniz employs three arguments to prove the existence\n",
      "of God: that of God as the sufficient reason of the world\n",
      "(substantially the cosmological proof); of God as the source\n",
      "of the pre-established harmony (an extension of the°teleolog-ical\n",
      "teleological proof); and the ontological. The latter he accepts as it\n",
      "came from the hands of Descartes, but insists that it°re-quires\n",
      "requires an added argument before it ranks as anything more\n",
      "than presumptive proof. The Anselmic-Cartesian argument,\n",
      "as stated by Leibniz, is as follows: \"God is defined as the\n",
      "greatest, or most perfect, of beings, or as a being of supreme\n",
      "grandeur and perfection. But in the notion of a perfect\n",
      "being, existence must be included, since it is something more\n",
      "to exist than not to exist. Or existence is a perfection, and\n",
      "hence must belong to the most perfect being; otherwise some\n",
      "perfection would be lacking, which is contrary to the°defini-tion\n",
      "definition.\" Or as Descartes sometimes puts it, in the notion of\n",

      "It has been frequently pointed out that Leibniz was the\n",
      "first to give ethics the form which it has since kept in\n",
      "German philosophy,—the division into Natur-Recht and°Na-tur\n",
      "Natur-Moral. These terms are difficult to give in English, but\n",
      "the latter corresponds to what is ordinarily called \"moral\n",
      "philosophy,\" while the former is political philosophy so far\n",
      "as that has an ethical bearing. Or the latter may be said to\n",
      "treat the moral ideal and of the moral motive and of duty in\n",
      "themselves, while the former deals with the social, the\n",
      "public, and in a certain sense the external, aspects of°moral-ity\n",
      "morality.\n",
      "Puffendorf undoubtedly suggested this division to\n",
      "Leibniz by his classification of duties as external and°inter-nal\n",
      "internal,—the first comprehending natural and civil law, the°sec-ond\n",
      "second moral theology. But Puffendorf confined the former to\n",
      "purely external acts, excluding motives and intentions, and\n",
      "the latter to divine revelation. Both are \"positive,\" and in\n",
      "some sort arbitrary,—one resting merely on the fact that\n",
      "certain institutions obtain, the other on the fact that God has\n",
      "made certain declarations. To Leibniz, on the other hand,\n",
      "the will of God is in no sense the source of moral truths. The\n",
      "will of God does not create truth, but carries into effect the\n",
      "eternal truths of the divine understanding. Moral truths are\n",
      "like those of mathematics. And again, there is no such thing\n",
      "as purely external morality: it always contains an inner\n",
      "content, of which the external act is only the manifestation.\n",
      "Leibniz may thus be said to have made two discoveries, or\n",
      "rather re-discoveries: one, that there is a science of morals,\n",
      "independent of law, custom, and positive right; the other,\n",
      "that the basis of both \"natural\" and \"positive\" morals is not\n",
      "the mere will of God, but is reason with its content of eternal\n",
      "truths.\n",
      "In morals the end is happiness, the means wisdom.\n",
      "Happiness is defined, not as an occurrence, but as a°condi-tion\n",
      "condition, or state of being. \"It is the condition of permanent joy.\n",
      "This does not mean that the joy is actually felt every°mo-ment\n",

      "thinks of it, and that, in the interval, joyfulness arises from\n",
      "his activity and being.\" Pleasure, however, is not a state,\n",
      "but a feeling. It is the feeling of perfection, whether in\n",
      "ourselves or in anything else. It does not follow that we\n",
      "perceive intellectually either in what the perfection of the\n",
      "pleasant thing consists or in what way it develops perfection\n",
      "within us. It is enough that it be realized in feeling, so as to\n",
      "give us pleasure. Perfection is defined \"as increase of being.\n",
      "As sickness is, as it were, a lowering and a falling off from\n",
      "health, so perfection is something which mounts above\n",
      "health. It manifests itself in power to act; for all substance\n",
      "consists in a certain power, and the greater the power the\n",
      "higher and freer the substance. But power increases in the\n",
      "degree that the many manifests itself from one and in one,\n",
      "while the one rules many from itself and transforms them\n",
      "into self. But unity in plurality is nothing else than°har-mony\n",
      "harmony; and from this comes order or proportion, from which\n",
      "proceeds beauty, and beauty awakens love. Thus it becomes\n",
      "evident how happiness, pleasure, love, perfection, substance,\n",
      "power, freedom, harmony, proportion, and beauty are bound\n",
      "up in one another.\"\n",
      "From this condensed sketch, taken from Leibniz°him-self\n",
      "himself, the main features of his ethical doctrine clearly appear.\n",
      "When we were studying freedom we saw that it was not so\n",
      "much a starting-point of the will as its goal and ideal. We\n",
      "saw also that true freedom is dependent upon knowledge,\n",
      "upon recognition of the eternal and universal. What we have\n",
      "here is a statement of that doctrine in terms of feeling and of\n",
      "will instead of knowledge. The end of man is stated to be\n",

      "way that it is seen to be equivalent to the Aristotelian notion\n",

      "to the public,—that is, to the community of spirits. This\n",
      "community includes first God, then humanity, then the\n",
      "state. These are so subordinated that, in cases of collision of\n",
      "duty, God, the universe of relations, comes before the profit\n",
      "of humanity, and this before the state. At another time\n",
      "Leibniz defines justice as social virtue, and says that there\n",
      "are as many kinds of \"right\" as there are kinds of natural\n",
      "communities in which happiness is an end of action. A\n",
      "natural community is defined as one which rests upon desire\n",
      "and the power of satisfying it, and includes three varieties,\n",
      "—domestic, civil, and ecclesiastic. \"Right\" is defined as that\n",
      "which sustains and develops any natural community. It is, in\n",

      "what makes happiness.\n",
      "Corresponding to the three forms of the social°organ-ism\n",
      "organism (as we should now call the \"natural community\"), are\n",
      "the three kinds of jus,—jus strictum, equity, and piety. Each\n",
      "of these has its corresponding prescript. That of jus strictum\n",
      "is to injure no one; of equity, to render to each his own; and\n",
      "of piety, to make the ethical law the law of conduct. Jus\n",
      "strictum includes the right of war and peace. The right of\n",
      "peace exists between individuals till one breaks it. The right\n",
      "of war exists between men and things. The victory of person\n",

      "that they differ in kind, as the conditioned from the°condi-tioning\n",
      "conditioning. At times, however, Leibniz attempts to carry out his\n",
      "monadism literally, and the result is that he conceives matter\n",

      "souls, or since this implies a dualism between matter and\n",
      "soul, of being made up, composed, of souls. But as he is\n",
      "obliged to explain that this composition is not spatial, or\n",
      "physical, but only ideal, this doctrine tends to resolve itself\n",
      "into the former. And thus we end where we began,—with a\n",
      "metaphor.\n",
      "On the other hand there is a wavering treatment of the\n",
      "nature of spirit. At times it is treated as precisely on a level\n",
      "in kind with the monads that \"compose\" matter, differing\n",
      "only in the greater degree of its activity. But at other times it\n",

      "these words, it is plainly asserted that only the spiritual\n",
      "being is worthy of being called a monad, or individual, at\n",
      "all, and that material being is simply a dependent°manifesta-tion\n",

      "be Leibnizians simply repeated the words of Leibniz without\n",
      "penetrating into his spirit, and that consequently they°mis-represented\n",
      "misrepresented him on every important point. He, Kant, on the\n",

      "Leibniz really means a harmony within intelligence, not a\n",
