The detector must consider as baskets the strings contained in the text column of the CSV files in the dataset, using words as items.\n",

Note also that the instruction pd.set_option(\"display.max_columns\", None) might be needed in order to deal with the size of the obtained dataframe. You are also free to suitably size the number of cases in your dataset, provided that your code is able to scale up.\n"
